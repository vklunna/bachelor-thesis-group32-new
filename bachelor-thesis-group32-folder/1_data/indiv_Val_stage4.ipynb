According to NATHAN analysis, this risk is expected to decrease significantly in the future. The site of Pune (India) is projected to face high-level physical risks in the medium and long-term. Its exposure to precipitation and heat stress is expected to increase, alongside the consistently high risk of fire weather across all time scales. Additionally, sites in Alajuela (Costa Rica), Haifa (Israel), and Colorado Springs (US) are assessed to have medium-level risks in the foreseeable future predominately driven by heat stress and drought.

Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment.

For X-ray tubes, only the re-used material weight is considered.
