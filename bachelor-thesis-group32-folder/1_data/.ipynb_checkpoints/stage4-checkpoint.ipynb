In Vietnam, Deep C Holding saw its industrial land sales decline to 80 hectares (127 hectares in 2023), partly due to the introduction of new real estate sales laws, which have led to delays in industrial land sales.

This means that they are not limited to car­ bon dioxide (CO2) alone, but also include other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). ESRS E1-6 AR 39b For the CFE group, the limits of GHG reporting under financial (accounting) and operational control are the same. This is due to the fact that all Business Units are fully integrated into the consolidated financial statements. Projects under joint control (joint ventures or joint operations) are accounted for according to CFE’s share (pro-rata) in the project.

There is a risk of potential contamination of natural environments, as well as a more general risk of impact on biodiversity. The increasing scarcity of materials, aggravated by growing demand and disruptions to supply chains, poses challenges for the sustainability of resources. Waste management is therefore crucial, as construction sites generate large quantities of waste that must be sorted and recycled to minimise their impact on the environment. Finally, water usage is also an important issue, as construction activities consume large quantities of water, and wastewater discharges can pollute water resources. In this regard, the Group is committed to reducing pollution and environmental waste by aiming for “ZERO environmental incidents”.

E1-6: Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions 2.2.5.1 Total GHG footprint Gross greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG protocol. This means that they are not limited to car­ bon dioxide (CO2) alone, but also include other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). ESRS E1-6 AR 39b For the CFE group, the limits of GHG reporting under financial (accounting) and operational control are the same. This is due to the fact that all Business Units are fully integrated into the consolidated financial statements. Projects under joint control (joint ventures or joint operations) are accounted for according to CFE’s share (pro-rata) in the project. This integrated approach ensures that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting is consistent with financial reporting. ESRS E1-6 50 Table 21 : GHG emissions \n",

Compared with 2024 and 2023, turnover increased slightly from 20.0% to 21.5%. Above all, this reflects a very clear trend for projects developed by BPI Real Estate (77.31% alignment in 2024 vs. 58.57% in 2023). With regards to projects developed by external clients, the trend is fairly stable (14.85% alignment in 2024 versus 14.46% in 2023).

Compared with 2024 and 2023, turnover increased slightly from 20.0% to 21.5%. Above all, this reflects a very clear trend for projects developed by BPI Real Estate (77.31% alignment in 2024 vs. 58.57% in 2023). With regards to projects developed by external clients, the trend is fairly stable (14.85% alignment in 2024 versus 14.46% in 2023).

Compared with 2024 and 2023, turnover increased slightly from 20.0% to 21.5%. Above all, this reflects a very clear trend for projects developed by BPI Real Estate (77.31% alignment in 2024 vs. 58.57% in 2023). With regards to projects developed by external clients, the trend is fairly stable (14.85% alignment in 2024 versus 14.46% in 2023).

BPI Real Estate is expected to post a positive net income in 2025, although the extent of this will depend on the strength and speed of the real estate market recovery in Belgium as in Luxembourg. VMA expects a stable activity level for 2025 combined with an improvement in operating margin. At MOBIX, the benefits of the diversification of its operations is set to intensify in 2025. The Construction & Renovation subsidiaries anticipate a decline in sales in 2025, given the persistently unsettled economic environ­ ment. Priority will be given to selectively taking on new orders and improving operating performance. CFE expects a moderate contraction in turnover in 2025 and net income close to that of 2024.

Consequently, although these projects are essential for urban and social development, their direct contribution to climate change adaptation remains limited. As CFE does not actually hold any real estate in its portfolio, there is no real financial risk associated with climate change adaptation. The absence of these assets means that CFE is not directly exposed to the potential costs associated with upgrading or protecting infrastructure against climate impacts. ESRS E1 SBM-3 19c Although climate change mitigation is a material issue for CFE, involving the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as its en­ ergy consumption, the theme of energy transition is not considered a material subject. This is because Scope 3 emissions, including embodied and operational carbon, are significantly higher than direct emissions. In other words, indirect emissions linked to the materials use\n",

The reduction potential of these actions is fairly limited (less than 1%), as total energy consumption in offices is very low compared with construction sites. Nevertheless, these actions are necessary to be consistent with other actions and to establish a real corporate culture around the challenges of climate change. Although we have taken advantage of most of the levers for reducing GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2, CFE continues to seek further optimisation of its energy consumption. The company regularly tests new pilot projects on its worksites, and closely monitors technological advances and innovations in this field.

This process begins with the identification and assessment of potential impacts. This includes carrying out risk analyses to identify potential hazards and assess their severity and probability. At the start of site activities, each subcontractor is required to share this specific risk analysis with the site management team, in order to analyse the resources to be implemented and responsibilities to­ gether.
