Complementary disclosure requirements for specific topical ESRS on the description of the processes to identify and assess,
"material impacts, risks and opportunities:",
E1,"The  Company  performed  an  advanced 
climate 
impact  and 
risk  assessment.  This 
included 
the"
Climate,"consideration  of  an  analysis  of  GHG  emissions 
from  own  operations,  a  screening  of  all  Scope  3"
change,"categories, that identified the usage of Airbus products (i.e. Scope 3 Category 11 - Use of Sold Products)"
,as representing a significant proportion of total emissions.
,"Share of Scope 3 Category 11 - Use of Sold Products emission in total emissions 
>90%"
,"The  Company  also  identified  climate  related  risks  following  a  TCFD-aligned  approach,  that  included a"
,screening of its sites and assets potential vulnerabilities to climate hazards (see “– 6.2.2.3 Description of
,"the  processes  to  identify  and  assess  material  climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2"
,"IRO-1)  and  Material  impacts,  risks  and  opportunities  and  their  interaction  with  strategy  and  business"
,"model  (ESRS  2  SBM-3)”.  Such  analyses considered time horizons, assumptions and scenarios (see “–"
,6.2.2.2  Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)“). See “– 6.2.2 E1 - Climate Change” chapter for full
,description.
E2,IRO  identification  processes  considered  all  business  operations  and  Company  sites  and  a  number  of
Pollution,"items  specific  to the topic, including those mentioned hereafter. The Company has screened the annual"
,declarations  made  by  its  sites  to local authorities in the context of the European Pollutant Release and
,Transfer Register (E-PRTR) regulation.
,"Number of facilities exceeding the 100 tonnes threshold for VOC emissions listed

(Hamburg)"
,Impacts in the upstream and downstream value chain have been assessed using the Life Cycle Analysis
,"(LCA)  approach,  such  as  the  one  in  relation  with  kerosene  production.  For  SOC/SOVHC,  risks  and"
,"opportunities have also been assessed using the register of the Company’s top company risks, according"
,to the ERM process. This risk notably applies to aircraft manufacturing and is therefore connected to all
,sites with such industrial operations and handling chemicals. The materiality assessment did not involve
,direct consultations with affected communities.
E3,"IRO 
identification  processes 
considered  all  business  activities  and  Company 
sites 
from  which"
Water and,"environmental data is collected (see “– 6.2.4.5 Metrics (E3-4)” and a number of items specific to the topic,"
marine,including  those  mentioned  hereafter.  The  Company  analysed  current  and  projected  local  water  stress
resources,levels  to  understand  where  the  Company’s  activities  have  the  greatest impact on water resources and
,where risks of business disruption linked to restrictions on the use of water are the most significant. This
,analysis  is  based  inter  alia  on the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas; this analysis
,"was last updated with the August 2023 update of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (version 4.0), using the"
,“baseline” data as well as the 2030 scenarios. This analysis allowed to identify that the Company operates
,"facilities located in high or extremely high water stress areas in Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy,"
,"Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, UK, US. It includes sites"
,"from Commercial Aircraft, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space. As for ESRS E2, impacts in"
,the  upstream  and  downstream  value  chain  have  been  assessed  using  the  Life  Cycle  Analysis  (LCA)
,approach. The materiality assessment did not involve consultations with affected communities.
E4,The  Company  is  still  progressing  its  understanding  of  the  impact  of its activities and those of its value
Biodiversity,chain  on  biodiversity.  IRO  identification  was  informed  by  the IPBES report's findings that there are five
,"significant  drivers  of  biodiversity  loss:  changing  use  of  sea  and  lands, direct exploitation of organisms,"
