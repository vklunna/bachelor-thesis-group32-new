,"climate change, pollution, and invasive non-native species. Using these five drivers is also prescribed as a"
,framework for analysis by ESRS E4 and was used by the Company to compile an inventory of potential
,"impacts. It considered a number of sources of information, amongst which the aircraft Life Cycle Analysis -"
,"that  notably  quantifies  impacts  related  to  land  use change, soil, water pollution across the value chain."
,The  indirect  impact  of  climate  change  appeared  as  a  salient  effect  on  biodiversity  as  well  the indirect
,impact of aviation fuel production.
,The  Company  has  considered  the  proximity  of  its  sites  relative  to  biodiversity-sensitive  areas  and  the
,"nature of operations in the value chain, including existing or potential pollution impacts."
,"To date, the Company has identified limited dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems within its value"
,"chain, including by screening its resource inflows and considering its business model, and primarily due to"
,the fact that manufacturing processes mostly rely on mineral or fossil resources.This limited dependency
,on ecosystem services as identified to date has not led to the identification of biodiversity-related material
,"transition, physical or systemic risks to the Company’s own operations."
,"The Company is reviewing its assessments on an ongoing basis. Going forward, specific attention will be"
,"given to the development of SAF production, particularly those pathways that use crops as feedstock and"
,"therefore  rely  on  ecosystem  services,  striving  to  get  a  permanent  understanding  of  SAF  production"
,"development  and  perspectives,  including  by  engaging  on  that  matter  with  relevant  players  in  the SAF"
,value chain and industry bodies.
,Beyond answering to applicable biodiversity related regulatory requirements that may imply to assess and
,"report to authorities deemed to represent communities’ interests, the Company did not specifically engage"
,"with any community on biodiversity in the frame of its DMA. Nature of impacts identified, essentially linked"
,to  indirect  effects  of  the  use  of its product on climate change and of the production of kerosene on the
,"water  resource,  has  not  permitted  identifying  specific  communities  that  would  be  materially  affected."
,Consequently  no  affected  communities has been involved in the materiality assessment nor any priority
,actions  for  the  avoidance  of impacts on ecosystem services relevant to affected communities has been
,identified.  The  Company  has  identified  some  sites  as  being  located  near  biodiversity-sensitive  areas
,based  on  whether  they  were  subject  to  specific  biodiversity-related  obligations  as  per  local  /  national
,"applicable regulations, or otherwise located in or directly adjacent to biodiversity-sensitive areas, including"
,some with manufacturing and flight test activities.
,"Number of sites located near biodiversity-sensitive areas 
15"
,None of these activities have been associated with a material negative impact on local biodiversity. As a
,"result, measures undertaken in the frame of addressing negative impacts on climate change were deemed"
,to be equally relevant for biodiversity mitigation.
