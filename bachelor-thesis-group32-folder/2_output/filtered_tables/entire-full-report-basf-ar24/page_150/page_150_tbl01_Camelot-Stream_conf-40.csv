The general bases of preparation for the Sustainability Statement are described in About This Report (see,,,
page 6). Information about corporate governance disclosures relating to sustainability (Disclosure,,,
"Requirements GOV-1, GOV-2 and GOV-3 of the ESRSs) is provided in the Corporate Governance Report",,,
from page 111 onward.,,,
Material topics along the value chain form the focal points of our reporting and define the reporting,,,
"boundaries. In identifying, prioritizing and validating material sustainability-related topics, we follow the",,,
"principle of double materiality, taking into consideration financial materiality and impact materiality. The",,,
"following chapters deal with the topics, subtopics and sub-subtopics that were found to be material",,,
within the meaning of the ESRSs upon performing the double materiality assessment. For more,,,
"information on the materiality assessment, see page 167 onward.",,,
"In some cases, we have made use of incorporation by reference to minimize redundancies. An overview",,,
of the data points incorporated by reference can be found on page 147. As permitted by ESRS 1,,,
"paragraph 7.7, we have opted not to disclose information relating to research and development (R&D),",,,
know-how or the results of innovation that has commercial value and whose publication would result in a,,,
competitive disadvantage for BASF. Time horizons specified in our Sustainability Statement are used in,,,
accordance with the ESRS definitions.,,,
"We discuss the impacts, risks and opportunities identified in our double materiality assessment in the",,,
sections concerning the respective topics. The section on opportunity and risk management also,,,
includes risk pursuant to Disclosure Requirement GOV-5 and presents disclosures on our opportunity,,,
and risk management system and internal controls of sustainability reporting (from page 87 onward).,,,
"When individual sustainability metrics have been estimated based on indirect sources, such as sector-",,,
"average data or other proxies, we provide more information in the respective chapters. This is also the",,,
case when metrics have been adjusted compared with prior reporting periods or when they are subject,,,
"to measurement uncertainty. Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up exactly to the totals",,,
shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown. As the calculations of our,,,
Scope 3 emissions (reported in E1 Climate Change from page 195 onward) are largely based on models,,,
"and statistics, they are subject to a high degree of uncertainty.",,,
Our data on environmental protection and safety is collected based on the recommendations of the,,,
International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and the European Chemical Industry Council,,,
"(CEFIC). Data relating to the environment, health and safety (EHS) and to human resources (HR) is",,,
recorded in a central database. The EHS data is captured for each site and company based at the,,,
respective site; the HR data is captured for each company. Environmental data (on emissions or water,,,
"volumes, for example) is determined by measurements, calculations or estimations according to the",,,
regulatory requirements or legal obligations. The data collection method selected depends on technical,,,
"limitations (high temperatures do not always allow the use of sensors for direct measurement), the ability",,,
"to derive data from data already collected, and the proportionality of efforts to take measurements in",,,
"relation to the emission in question (such as volume flow, operating hours). To increase the robustness of",,,
"our data, we apply a two-step process in which sustainability data is first recorded and then validated in",,,
accordance with the principle of dual control. Additional plausibility checks are carried out by the,,,
"responsible Corporate Center units, after which the data is evaluated based on the respective",,,
consolidation criteria and aggregated in the database.,,,
The reporting period is the 2024 business year. We include relevant data made available up to,,,
"preparation of this report by the Board of Executive Directors at the accounts meeting on March 17,",,,
2025 (editorial deadline). We have explained any changes to calculations of metrics or targets compared,,,
