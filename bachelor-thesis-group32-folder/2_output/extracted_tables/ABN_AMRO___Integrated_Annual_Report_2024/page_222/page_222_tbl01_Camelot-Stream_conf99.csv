"1. ABN AMRO is disclosing climate-related risk metrics, which partially address E1-9 paragraph 66. This pertains to physical risk metrics (refer to ABN AMRO’s physical risk 
tables by industry and geography), and E1-9 paragraph 67, which pertains to transition risk metrics (refer to ABN AMRO’s 'sectors highly contributing to climate change'"
tables and the climate heatmap disclosures).
