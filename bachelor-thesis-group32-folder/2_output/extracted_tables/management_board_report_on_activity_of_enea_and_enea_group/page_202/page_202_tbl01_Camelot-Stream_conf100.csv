[DR G1-1.R.10.c.i.] [DR G1-1.R.10.a.] In accordance with the Procedure for Reporting Breaches and Protecting Whistleblowers at Enea
"S.A., breaches may be reported by:"
"an  application  making  it  possible  to  report  breaches  anonymously  and  orally,  guaranteeing  complete  confidentiality  and 
•"
"information security; the application is available at https://www.enea.pl/ on the Compliance tab,"
"sending a personal or anonymous message in a letter to the address given in the Procedure, depending on the entity that the 
•"
"report refers to: the Compliance Committee at Enea S.A., the President of the Management Board of Enea S.A., the Supervisory"
"Board Chairperson of Enea S.A., with the note “report”."
"an oral report, which may be made at a direct meeting arranged within 14 days of the date of receipt of a request for such a 
•"
meeting.
"The Procedure for Reporting Breaches and Protecting Whistleblowers at Enea S.A. makes it possible to report breaches by employees,"
"temporary  workers,  persons  working  on  another  basis  than  an  employment  contract,  including  a  civil  law  contract,  entrepreneurs,"
"commercial proxies, shareholders or partners, members of authorities of a legal entity or an unincorporated association, persons working"
"under supervision and management of a contractor, subcontractor or a supplier, trainees, voluntary workers, apprentices, officers within"
the meaning of the Officers Retirement Benefits Act and soldiers within the meaning of the Homeland Defense Act. Similar mechanisms
and channels for reporting breaches are available in the other Group companies which have adopted their own procedures for reporting
"breaches and protecting whistleblowers, except for LW Bogdanka S.A., where these issues are regulated in the Procedure for Internal"
Reports and Follow-up Measures.
"[DR G1-1.R.10.e.] [DR G1-3.R.18.b.] The provided information is reviewed promptly, independently and objectively. The standard time"
"limit for reviewing reports is 3 months from the date of confirming receipt of an internal report. If no confirmation is provided, the time limit"
for reviewing an internal report is 3 months after a period of 7 days from the date of submitting the report unless the whistleblower failed
"to leave a contact address to which feedback should be given. In justified cases, the time limit for reviewing reports may be extended."
The Enea Group adheres to the principle that persons investigating a report must be independent of the chain of management involved
"in the matter. Pursuant to the Procedure for Reporting Breaches and Protecting Whistleblowers at Enea S.A., the Compliance Committee"
"at  Enea  S.A.  records  a  Report  in  the  Register  of  Internal  Reports  of  the  Company  and  takes  Follow-up  Measures.  Furthermore,  the"
Compliance  Committee  at  Enea  S.A.  prepares  and  regularly  maintains  the  Register  of  Internal  Reports  of  the  Company.  Similar
"documents are in force in the subsidiaries of the Enea Group, e.g. Procedure for Reporting Breaches and Protecting Whistleblowers at"
Enea Elektrownia Połaniec or Procedure for Reporting Breaches and Protecting Whistleblowers at Enea Ciepło – Headquarters.
"At  LW  Bogdanka,  pursuant  to  the  Procedure  for  Internal  Reports  and  Follow-up  Measures,  findings  of  conducted  investigations  are"
presented to a selected management board member and in cases involving management board members to the company’s supervisory
board.
"[DR G1-4.R.24.a] [DR G1-4.R.24.b] In 2024, there were no court proceedings which would rule that companies from the Enea Group"
"breached anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Therefore, no fines were imposed in connection with such laws. Apart from the measures"
"described in this part of this Report, the Group did not take any additional actions to address breaches in procedures and standards of"
anti-corruption and anti-bribery.
[DR G1-4.MDR-M.77.a] [DR G1-4.MDR-M.77.b] Data about incidents of corruption and bribery come from registers of breaches kept by
"the companies in accordance with the procedures for reporting breaches and protecting whistleblowers. For some companies, data are"
obtained from monthly reports of incidents in the Compliance area. Data about court proceedings come from registers of court  cases
maintained by the companies. The measurement of this metric has not been validated by an external body.
Protection of whistleblowers
"[DR G1-1.R.11] [DR G1-1.R.10.c.i]. [DR G1-1.R.10.c.ii.] [DR G1-1.R.10.d.] Pursuant to the Whistleblower Protection Act, transposing the"
"Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Enea Group, in its internal regulations, ensures complete"
protection to persons reporting breaches. The Procedure for Reporting Breaches and Protecting Whistleblowers at Enea S.A. clearly
prohibits any retaliation and attempts or threats of retaliation. The rule also applies to those who help provide information about breaches
or information associated with whistleblowers. Measures to protect employees from own workforce who are whistleblowers from retaliation
"include  prohibitions  against  termination  or  termination  without  notice  of  an  employment  contract,  reduction  of  remuneration  for  work,"
"withholding  of  promotion  or  omission  from  promotion,  omission  from  granting  non-salary  work-related  benefits  or  reduction  of  their"
"amounts, transfer to a lower position or suspension from employment or business duties. Hindering a whistleblowing report or unlawfully"
revealing the identity of a whistleblower is considered a violation of the core values and ethical principles of the  Enea Group Code of
Ethics.
