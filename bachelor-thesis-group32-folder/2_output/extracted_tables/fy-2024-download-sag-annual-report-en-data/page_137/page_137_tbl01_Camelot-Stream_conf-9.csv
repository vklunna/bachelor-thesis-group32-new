Integration of the results of the double materiality assessment into corporate processes,,,
The entire double materiality assessment process and its results are closely coordinated and interlinked with,,,
Corporate  Risk  Management.  Risk,identification,is  already  based  on  the  Corporate  Risk  Management,
inventory. Close cooperation between Corporate Sustainability and the central risk management team also,,,
"ensured that, where impacts and dependencies were identified, a review was carried out to determine whether",,,
these gave rise to financial risks and/or opportunities. The assessment criteria used for the double materiality,,,
"assessment  are  also  coordinated  with  Corporate  Risk  Management.  During  the  validation  phase,  the",,,
"assessments were also subjected to a final comparison with the company’s previous risk profile. In addition,",,,
"the material sustainability risks are part of the company’s risk inventory, ensuring that sustainability risks have",,,
the same importance as other risks in the company.,,,

integration 
into  the  company’s",
opportunity management processes is not yet relevant.,,,
Prioritization and monitoring of sustainability issues,,,
"The  Corporate  Sustainability  department  is  responsible  for  the  entire  process  of  identifying,  evaluating,",,,
prioritizing  and  monitoring  material  sustainability,,"issues  and 
the  associated 
IROs.  This  also 
includes",
"interlinking  it  with  other  corporate  processes  such  as  the  human  rights  due  diligence  process,  risk  and",,,
opportunity management and other relevant processes. A further prioritization of the material IROs has not,,,
yet taken place and will be reviewed in fiscal year 2025.,,,

sustainability statement,,,
The following table summarizes the ESRS reporting requirements contained in the Sustainability Statement.,,,
The table refers to the page numbers and/or paragraphs where the corresponding reporting requirements can,,,
be found in the Sustainability Statement.,,,

guide (‘List of ESRS Datapoints’). The company has not identified any immaterial datapoints and therefore has,,,
"not made use of the materiality of information principle. In the first reporting year, the company concentrated",,,
"on mandatory disclosures. However, it has also voluntarily included disclosures that are subject to a transitional",,,
period  of  one  year  in  the  social  information  section.  These  are  disclosures  S1-7  (Characteristics  of  non-,,,
"employee  workers  in  the  undertaking’s  own  workforce),  S1-8  (Collective  bargaining  coverage  and  social",,,
"dialogue), S1-11 (Social protection), S1-12 (Percentage of employees with disabilities), S1-13 (Training and skills",,,
