"subsequently, if appropriate, deriving the risks and opportunities arising from the impacts and"
dependencies.
[ESRS 2-IRO-1.53c iii] Borealis did not prioritize different types of risk in its assessment. All
risks were treated in the same way.
[ESRS 2-IRO-1.53c ii] The existing risk management principles were applied in the Risk and
"Opportunities assessment process. As described in [ESRS 2-IRO-1.53a], the ROs were"
qualitatively analyzed based on a basic scale using a risk matrix consisting of probability of
occurrence and the magnitude of the financial effect.
Appropriate thresholds are necessary to determine which risks and opportunities are material
"for reporting purposes. Borealis has defined its financial materiality threshold as 1.5, which"
classes high financial effects and the upper range of medium financial effects as material.
[ESRS 2-IRO-1.53d] The decision-making process involved different internal and external
"experts in workshops, where topics were identified, assessed and discussed."
"In Q1 2024, the results and the process of the materiality analysis were presented at the CSRD"
"Steering Committee, where the most relevant Vice Presidents (for example from Health, Safety,"
"Environment and Quality, People & Culture and Procurement) are represented. After that step,"
the results of the materiality analysis were presented to the Executive Board.
"[ESRS 2-IRO-1.53e, f] Borealis has established a Group Risk Management process and tool, in"
compliance with its Risk Management Policy. The IRO assessment and the enterprise risk
management (ERM) process have different objectives and consequently different scopes and
"assessment granularity. While certain ESRS topics are already covered by the ERM, the ERM"
for example does not include the value chain or an in-depth impact assessment and mainly
focuses on the outside-in perspective.
"For the time being, Borealis does not therefore intend to fully integrate the ESRS IRO"
"assessment process and methodologies into its existing ERM process. Instead, the Group plans"
"to adopt the existing process and tools where feasible and needed, to ensure sufficient"
"alignment, leverage synergies, avoid discrepancies and allow cross-information, as well as"
complementing each other where feasible and necessary.
"[ESRS 2-IRO-1.53g] To prepare the long-list of sustainability topics, Borealis used the list of"
"relevant (sub-sub-) topics from [ESRS 1, Appendix B, AR 16] as a basis. In addition, topics"
"were added to the long list by consulting the ESRS ED – Oil and Gas (Draft 3.2023), GRI 11 Oil"
"and Gas, SASB Standards (Oil & Gas: Refining and Marketing), SASB Standards (Oil & Gas:"
"Exploration and Production), SASB Standards (Chemicals), IPIECA and SBTN Sector"
Materiality by UNEP-WCMC.
"Each topic on the list was discussed with the OMV AG, OMV Petrom and Borealis topic experts"
"in a workshop, to determine for each entity if the topic was relevant for the next steps in the"
materiality assessment process.
E1 – Climate Change
"[E1-IRO-1.20a] Impacts have been identified within the sub-topics “Climate change adaptation”,"
"“Climate change mitigation” and “Energy” within the upstream, core and downstream value"
chain.
