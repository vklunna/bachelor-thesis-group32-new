"As described under [ESRS 2-IRO-1.53a-h], the impacts caused by Borealis’ GHG emissions"
"were assessed against the following categories: scale, scope, remendability and likelihood."
"Within these categories, the highest possible level of evaluation was assumed."
"[E1-IRO-1.20b], [E1-IRO-1.AR 11a-d] Borealis commissioned a study on climate risks at site"
"level for its own operations in 2022. It assessed hazards, vulnerabilities and risks, with regard to"
"physical risks such as extreme temperature, drought, wildfire, coastal flooding, fluvial flooding,"
"water stress and tropical cyclones, combined with a sophisticated understanding of the"
vulnerability of 17 production sites to each type of hazard. The scenarios modeled were RCP
"8.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 4.5 and RCP 2.6 with the 2030, 2050 and 2070 decades in focus. Therefore"
the identification of climate related hazards and the assessment of exposure and
"sensitivity, including consideration of likelihood and magnitude, has been informed by a high"
emissions climate scenario.
"The methodology is built on principles similar to catastrophe risk models, but is also driven by"
"climate model and socioeconomic model data, which are relevant for Borealis. Inputs include"
"terabytes of climate and socioeconomic data on hazards from public (including IPCC, NASA,"
"NOAA), academic and commercial sources, and proprietary TCS models."
"The time horizons used for the climate vulnerability study were 10, 30 and 50 years. These"
horizons reflect the most relevant cornerstones for the different IPCC climate scenarios as well
as the long-term characteristic of Borealis’ asset strategies. Capital allocation plans were out of
scope.
The most-affected sites and the types of physical risks are shown in the table below:
