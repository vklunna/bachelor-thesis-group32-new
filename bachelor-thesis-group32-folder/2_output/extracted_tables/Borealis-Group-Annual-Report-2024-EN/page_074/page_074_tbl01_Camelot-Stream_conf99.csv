"innovative low emission solutions. As shown in [IRO-1.53a], the long-term horizon covers more"
than five years.
The planned climate-risk and vulnerability study in 2025 will include a detailed analysis
"considering, as a minimum, a climate scenario in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C with"
"no or limited overshoot, as well as a thorough assessment of the Group’s assets and business"
activities.
"To be compatible with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, Borealis is reducing its Scope"
1 GHG emissions by investing in energy efficiency projects and replacing components reaching
"end of life with more carbon-friendly solutions until 2030. Furthermore, Borealis is increasing the"
"share of renewable electricity to 100% by 2030. On the path towards climate neutrality, new"
technologies such as electrification of crackers need to be developed and assessed for their
"feasibility in large-scale chemical plants. For hard-to-abate emissions, carbon capture"
technologies will be needed to reach net-zero by 2050.
"[E1-IRO-AR 15] Based on the planning data, Borealis Group will need to purchase additional"
emission certificates from 2028 onward. These costs are incorporated into the Mid-Term Plan
"(MTP) 2025-2030 and allocated to the respective CGUs for the impairment test. Furthermore,"
Borealis’ management projects higher margins starting from 2028 to partly offset carbon-related
expenses.
The only place where critical climate-related assumptions are used in the financial statements is
in the context of impairment testing.
The climate scenarios used are currently not fully aligned with the critical climate related
assumptions made in the financial statements.
E2 - Pollution
[E2-IRO-1.11a] Borealis has not performed a specific IRO assessment on individual operational
sites or business areas. The IRO assessment was informed by Borealis’ continuously
"monitoring its emissions to air, water and soil at all its production locations. These emissions are"
"documented and shared with location management, who take action where needed. This"
information and learning consolidated across all operational sites fed into the IRO assessment.
Borealis has not conducted a specific IRO/ESRS assessment for the value chain for this report.
The IRO assessment was informed as follows:
−  The IRO assessment on E2 for the upstream value chain for fossil-based suppliers is mainly
"based on information provided by OMV, which is generally valid for all fossil-based suppliers."
−  The IRO assessment on E2 for the upstream value chain for renewable-based suppliers is
based on common knowledge of the potential negative impacts of agricultural activities.
−  The IRO assessment on E2 for downstream value chain regarding the impact of plastic
waste on the environment is based on common knowledge based on multiple studies from
"renowned institutions such as the UN, and IUCN, as well as national environmental"
agencies.
[E2-IRO-1.11b] No additional formal consultation beyond the regular interaction between
location management and communities has been conducted with affected communities during
"the DMA, in relation to Borealis’ actual or potential impact on pollution. However, discussions"
"with representatives relating to Operation Clean Sweep (specifically the EU Commission, NGOs"
