"and other EU Member States, as they are part of the OCS SteerCo) were held as described in"
chapter E2.
[E2-IRO-1.AR 9] The list of site locations and business activities associated with material IROs
can be found in [E2.2.18].
E3 – Water and marine resources
"[E3-IRO-1.8a], [E3 AR 1.15] The assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities was conducted"
"as described under [IRO-1.53a-h]. In carrying out the assessment: assets, activities,"
"geographical areas, marine resource related commodities and sectors and segments were"
"screened implicitly, but not in a more detailed and structured process."
[E3-IRO-1.8b] No consultations with affected communities beyond the regular interaction
between location management and communities have been conducted during the double
materiality analysis.
E4 - Biodiversity and ecosystems
"[E4-IRO-1.17a, c], [E4-AR 4-6] The assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities was"
conducted as described under [IRO-1.53a-h]. The contribution to direct impact drivers on
"biodiversity loss, impacts on the state of species, impacts on the extent and condition of"
ecosystems and impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services has not been included
within the process in a more detailed and structured way.
[E4-IRO-1.17b] The following dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems and their services
have been identified during the DMA. In the upstream and core value chain (as mentioned
"above, the process was not carried out in a more detailed way):"
−  Water cycles
−  Soil functions
"−  Ecosystem services (for example, the fishery industry, tourism or farmers who need"
pollination)
"[E4-IRO-1.17e i-iii] No consultations beyond the regular ongoing interactions, that are not"
"specific for key issues and or projects, between location management and communities were"
conducted with affected communities.
"[E4-IRO-1.19a] Borealis is committed to understanding and mitigating its environmental impact,"
including potential effects on biodiversity-sensitive areas. The Group has started a project to
evaluate how its activities might impact biodiversity-sensitive areas.
[E4-IRO-1.17d] Systemic risks relating to biodiversity were not considered within the double
materiality assessment. [E4-IRO-1.19b] As Borealis has not identified any material IROs
referring to biodiversity no mitigation measures have been set up.
E5 - Resource use and the circular economy
"[E5-IRO-1.11a], [E5- AR 1-13] The assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities was"
conducted as described under [IRO-1.53a-h]. Sub-topics related to resource use and circular
economy have been considered as part of the double materiality assessment. Assets and
activities as well as impacts and risks of staying in business as usual have been screened
"implicitly, but not in a more detailed and structured process."
