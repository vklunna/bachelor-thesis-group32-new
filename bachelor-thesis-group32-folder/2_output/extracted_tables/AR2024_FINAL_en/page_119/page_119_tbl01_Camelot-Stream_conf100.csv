The current portfolio state in relation to the above-mentioned indicators led to material transition risks in both climate change miti-
gation and energy – the latter focusing especially on potential decreased profitability and liquidity shortage due to increasing energy
costs and related default risk.
"G
iven the fact, that the decarbonisation of the portfolio also for Erste Group as a member of the Net Zero Banking Alliance dedicated"
"to Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees, will be a long-term exercise, transition risks resulting out"
"of the financed portfolio were also assessed to be prominent over all time horizons (short, medium and long-term). For further ex-"
"planations, please refer to chapter E1 SBM-3."
"T
he evaluation of transition opportunities is taking into account the current distribution of the portfolio and the potential financial"
benefits of identified opportunities. This includes opportunities from financing companies investing into the decarbonisation of their
"own business models and clients offering climate change adaptation solutions, for example in the real estate sector."
Non-material sustainability matters
"Erste Group examined various topics, including pollution, water and marine resources, resource use and circular economy. In all"
"these areas, no material IROs were identified. The assessment considered Erste Group’s business model as a financial institution and"
its up- and downstream value chain. The assessments indicated that the potential IROs were considered minor and non-material due
to Erste Group’s non-manufacturing business model and the structure of its portfolio.
E2 Pollution
"The upstream value chain, such as IT-providers and infrastructure software, as well as Erste Groups own operations and downstream"
value chain were considered in the assessment of pollution matters. As Erste Group is not a manufacturing company and has no
"direct reference points to pollution, potential impacts were assessed not to be material. Concerning potential risks and opportunities"
regarding pollution were analysed based on the current business strategy and portfolio structure.
E3 Water and marine resources
"Similarly to pollution, potential impacts relating to water and marine resources in the upstream value chain, such as the water usage"
"connected to IT services, as well as the downstream value chain were assessed. As Erste Group is not a manufacturing company and"
"as there is direct water consumption only at the bank’s office locations, impacts relating to Erste Group’s own operations are deemed"
minor. Concerning potential risks and opportunities were assessed based on the current business strategy and portfolio structure in
combination with the results of Erste Group’s risk materiality assessment and underlying ESG sector risk heatmap.
E5 Resource use and circular economy
Erste Groups own operations and upstream value chain were assessed together with impacts related to the financed portfolio. While
"Erste Group's investments in, and financing of companies that operate or manufacture machines that produce a lot of (hazardous)"
"waste, or are resource in-tense, have a negative impact on the state of the environment, the effect was assessed not to be material"
"based on the industry mix of Erste Group’s portfolio. For risks and opportunities, the financed portfolio was considered."
