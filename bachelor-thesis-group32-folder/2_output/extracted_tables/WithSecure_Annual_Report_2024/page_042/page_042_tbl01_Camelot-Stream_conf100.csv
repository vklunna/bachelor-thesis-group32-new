Other non-material environmental impacts from WithSecure’s
upstream value chain and circular economy
WithSecure has assessed various environmental impacts within its upstream value
"chain and circular economy. The ESRS topics of “E2 Pollution”, “E3 Water and"
"Marine Resources”, “E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems”, and “E5 Circular Economy”"
have not been identified as material topics for the company. The assessment
"methodology and assumptions made for assessing all of the ESRS topics, possible"
"impacts, risks, and opportunities, and their materiality are detailed before this"
section under “Parameters used and scope of analysis”.
"Other environmental impacts, including pollution (E2), water and marine resources"
"(E3), and biodiversity and ecosystems (E4), have been evaluated. These impacts"
"are considered to be of low significance, narrow in scope, and have a low likelihood"
of occurrence for WithSecure’s operations. Even though these possible impacts
"are not easily remediable, WithSecure can have indirect positive effects for the"
environment by ensuring its products are efficiently made. This in turn reduces the
"need for new devices. However, these positive impacts are quite small and limited,"
rendering the other ESRS environmental impact topics immaterial to WithSecure.
"Similarly, the ESRS topic of circular economy (E5), encompassing WithSecure’s"
"sustainable value chain, recycling, and waste management, has not been identified"
as a material topic. The environmental impacts related to the circular economy are
"also considered to be of low significance, narrow in scope, and have a low likelihood"
of occurrence. WithSecure can have a small impact on the circular economy and
"resource efficiency by ensuring its products are efficiently built, improving the"
"lifetime of users’ devices, and minimizing the use of data centers. However, this"
impact is limited due to the company's size and product scope. Negative impacts
on resource efficiency can occur if WithSecure's products require more resources
"and energy, and waste from operations can negatively impact the circular economy"
unless managed well. These negative impacts can be mitigated through proper
"product planning and recycling measures, thus mitigating the impacts."
