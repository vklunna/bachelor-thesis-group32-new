"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 204 The maritime sector is made up of eight sub-sectors: ■the fishing, seaweed, shellfish farming and sustainable aquaculture sector; ■the seafood trade and processing sector; ■transport and freight; ■boating, yachting and ocean racing; ■shipbuilding, ship repair and infrastructure; ■marine defence, security and safety; ■marine and renewable energies; ■and a cross-disciplinary sector: sea-techs. To help reduce these pressures and direct funding towards preserving and restoring marine biodiversity and ecosystems, the Group has put in place a number of action levers: ■more specifically in the maritime transport sector, the Group has approved a dedicated policy(1) in 2024, including, for financing requests, the analysis of ESG criteria(2) dedicated specifically to climate and biodiversity issues, such as requirements linked to the ship's flag and regulations. These practices contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 on “aquatic life”(3); ■other levers for action include: - support for responsible innovation and sea-techs(4); - setting up partnerships with players working to promote sustainable practices, such as the Pôle mer Bretagne Atlantique, Ifremer, the Cluster Maritime Français and non- governmental organisations such as Pure Ocean; - investment in funds that specifically address marine biodiversity issues. 4.2.3.4 Impacts and actions at Group sites The sites that the Group owns, leases or manages are mainly offices, bank branches (local banks), staff accommodation, automated teller machines (ATMs) and social housing managed by its subsidiary Armorique Habitat. The Group also has a number of specific sites, including three catering facilities, two logistics platforms and five data centres. The Group has assessed the dependence of its own sites on biodiversity and the actual or potential negative impacts of these sites on biodiversity and ecosystems, including biodiversity-sensitive areas, as non-material due to the typology of its sites, its financial activities and the management of social housing. The analysis shows that dependencies are essentially linked to water consumption, which is assessed as low (cf. ESRS E3), and therefore not material for the Group's own sites. The analysis of the assessment of the actual or potential impact on biodiversity revealed that the possible pressures of these sites could be linked to land reclamation, water and waste management. Given the location of these sites in urban areas, on the outskirts of or within towns or small conurbations, the low consumption of water and the low generation of waste, it has been concluded that the activity carried out at the Group's sites has no material negative impact on biodiversity. In addition to this overall analysis of the impact of its sites, and aware that the nature and extent of the pressures may differ depending on their location, the Group has mapped all the sites it owns, leases or manages, in order to identify those located in or near a biodiversity hotspot(5). The sites identified are located in urban or suburban areas in France and have not resulted in any additional artificialisation of the land. The assessment of the nature and extent of water consumption and waste management does not vary according to the identification of sites because of their location in or near sensitive areas. With the exception of its social housing subsidiary Armorique Habitat, the Group does not build new homes on a frequent basis. Any potential negative impacts on biodiversity are taken into account in advance via the prior planning authorisation. This authorisation incorporates environmental aspects, as specified in the Environmental Code(6), in order to limit any negative material impact. Given the low level of pressure exerted by the activities of these sites on biodiversity-sensitive areas, in terms of land artificialisation, water consumption (in relation to ESRS E3) and waste management, it has been concluded that the Group's sites have no actual or potential negative impacts. The Group has not identified any negative impact of its direct operations on threatened species. Given the low level of pressure, the Group has not put in place a specific policy to protect biodiversity and ecosystems at operational sites that it owns, leases or manages in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. However, the Group is committed to continuous improvement and has taken action by prioritising its head offices and new buildings, via BREEAM certification and the use of ecologists. The Group is not subject to regulatory requirements to implement biodiversity mitigation measures. It has not used regulatory or voluntary measures to compensate for the loss of biodiversity in its action plans.

A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place. (1) European standard 12056-1 defines grey water as wastewater with a low level of pollution, such as that produced by showers, baths, washbasins and washing machines, which can be recycled as non-potable cold water.

The EU Taxonomy is essentially: ■a common language enabling companies and investors to identify environmentally sustainable activities; ■a common metric, in the form of the sustainable percentage of the entity's exposures, the Green Asset Ratio - GAR. This metric makes it easier to compare the sustainability performance of European banks. In order for an exposure, whether a loan or a security, to be eligible for the sustainability test, its purpose (in the sense of reason, purpose) or the activity of its ultimate beneficiary, must be listed by the European Commission as likely to contribute substantially to one of the following six environmental objectives: ■climate change mitigation; ■climate change adaptation; ■sustainable use and production of water and marine resources; ■the transition to a circular economy; ■pollution prevention and control; ■protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Once an exposure is identified as eligible according to the European Commission, to be classified as environmentally sustainable, it must also meet the technical criteria defined by the regulation. This implies that the exposure: (i) contributes substantially to an environmental objective; (ii) does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives (DNSH criteria). In addition, the activity underlying the exposure must be carried out in compliance with the OECD's minimum social guarantees, thus ensuring a responsible and ethical approach. Application timetable ■from the 2021 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish annually the proportion of its exposures eligible, in accordance with the provisions of the regulation, for the first two objectives. Eligibility for the other four objectives is published from the 2024 financial year. ■since the 2023 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has published the proportion of exposures in line with the first two objectives (the Green Asset Ratio or GAR), i.e. eligible exposures that pass the three tests for alignment with the EU Taxonomy. ■from 2023 onwards, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish the aligned share of its off-balance sheet exposures, financial guarantees and assets under management. ■in addition, on 8 November 2024, the European Commission published a directive requiring banking groups to publish performance indicators for all their business segments. In response, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is publishing, from the 2024 financial year, in addition to the information already provided in the Green Asset Ratio performance indicators for life insurance and asset management activities. ■finally, from 2025 onwards, banks will publish the proportion of their on- and off-balance sheet exposures aligned with the other four objectives and publish indicators relating to fees and commissions and trading portfolios. The assessment of the eligibility and alignment of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's activities was carried out using a methodological approach that included a detailed analysis of the Group's activities, based on existing processes and reporting systems. The main methodological principles are described below. These may be revised according to changes in regulations. (1) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 208 4.2.5.2 The green asset ratio - methodology and figures for the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group The Green Asset Ratio is calculated on the basis of the Group's total assets, established in accordance with FINREP regulations(1). Assets are presented at gross value, i.e. before impairment, provision and amortisation. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio s: An activity is eligible for the Green Asset Ratio if it is defined and described in a delegated act relating to one of the six environmental objectives. The regulations have defined 15 sectors and 147 activities that fall within the scope of the Green Asset Ratio. As a result, the scope of activities eligible for the Green Asset Ratio for banking institutions includes: ■dedicated loans to individuals: - the acquisition or construction of a residential property; - energy-efficient renovation of buildings; - equipment that promotes the energy efficiency of buildings; - renewable energy technologies; - motor vehicles from 1 January 2022. - the eligible share of exposures to companies subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (2), based on the share of eligible activity published by the counterparty or the purpose of the financing (e.g., a company's exposure to the CSRD). (renewable energy, green bonds); - loans to local authorities to finance social housing or other projects whose purpose is an eligible activity according to the European Commission; - collateral obtained by seizure of real estate. The amount of eligible assets is related to the amount of of assets covered, the denominator of the Green Asset Ratiodenominator, which corresponds to the eligible items listed above, plus: ■other exposures not eligible for the Green Asset Ratio on financial and non-financial counterparties subject to the CSRD, retail customers and local authorities(3). ■exposures to companies not subject to the CSRD (financial and non-financial companies outside the European Union, small and medium-sized companies in the EU below the thresholds); ■derivatives, interbank sight loans, cash and cash equivalents and other assets(4).

The eligibility ratio (revenue view(7)) at 31 December 2024 (41%) was down 3% compared with 31 December 2023 (44%). This decrease is mainly due to the application of the FAQ of the European Commission (November 2024), which specifies that general financing for local authorities should be included in the denominator. The pro-forma version of the eligibility ratio, with application of the FAQ, as at 31 December 2023, is 42%. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio are then tested for alignment with the European Green Taxonomy. (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/534 known as FINREP (FINancial REPorting). (2) EU Directive 2022/2464, known as the CSRD Directive. (3) The European Commission's FAQ of November 2024 specifies that general funding for local authorities should be included in the denominator.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 257 4.6 Duty of care plan 4.6.1.1 The duty of care plan report In order to meet the requirements set by the law of 27 March 2017 relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group deploys a duty of care plan relating to risks of serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, health & safety and the environment. The Group's duty of care plan is divided into four parts: potential negative impacts as a company, as a customer in its relations with suppliers and service providers, potential negative impacts related to its financial business lines and potential negative impacts as a service provider. It has a dedicated organisation and management. Organisation, governance and management of the duty of care plan The implementation of the duty of care within the Group is coordinated by a cross-functional Steering Committee, whose role is to ensure that the duty of care is deployed by the Group’s entities, to monitor validated actions and to set out the progress plan. This committee, led by the Sustainable Finance Department of the General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, brings together the Dynamics and Human Relations, Organisation and Resources, Purchasing, Risk and Compliance and Permanent Control Departments. In 2024, it met three times. The Group's duty of care plan is also monitored through: ■indicators of the means put in place to prevent negative impacts; ■and indicators of the results of the action plans in the three areas (negative impacts as a company, as a principal, in financial activities and as a service provider), which make it possible to assess the effectiveness of the actions taken. The duty of care plan was approved by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's Executive Management Committee on 4 November 2024 and presented to the Group's Strategy and Societal Responsibility Committee on 21 January 2025. Major actions that marked the year 2024 In 2024, work was carried out to ensure the consistent implementation of the regulatory requirements of the duty of care and those of the Directive on the publication of sustainability-related information by enterprises (CSRD). As a result, work has been carried out to ensure that the mapping of the negative impacts of the CSRD and the mapping of the impact of the duty of care now constitute a single joint exercise. The methodology for identifying and assessing impacts is described in ESRS 2 (paragraph 4.1.3.2 Information on the materiality assessment process). The negative impacts assessed as material are presented in section 4.1.2.2 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and the link with the strategy and business model (SBM-3). As a result, the content of the duty of care plan has been expanded to include three new areas of negative impact assessed as material for the Group: ■negative impacts on water via the downstream value chain (banking; ■negative impacts on inclusion via products and services (own operations); ■negative impacts on customer privacy (own operations).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 259 A - Negative impacts as a company Human Rights Each year, the Group maps out the potential negative impact of its direct activities on human rights (as a company), including an analysis of changes in the geographical presence of its workforce. This analysis is obtained by cross- referencing the country where the Group's(1) workforce is based with the mapping of the levels of potential negative impact on human rights by country. The level of potential negative impacts is thus qualified as “low” for 100% of the workforce. The Group was mainly present in France, with 97.4% of the workforce at 31 December 2024, but also in one Western European country, with 2.6%of the workforce at 31 December 2024. To date, no country in which it operates has been assessed as having a high negative impact. In addition to this analysis of potential negative impacts, the Dynamics & Human Relations Department assesses the level of “net” impacts for each entity. These negative impact on human rights (discrimination including gender inequality, child labour, forced labour, indecent working conditions, lack of right to education, lack of respect for freedom of association, right to information, privacy and data protection) are all at a low level for all entities (stable compared with 2023). Despite the low level of impact, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa pays particular attention to each of these issues (see. 4.3.2.5.1 Inclusion strategy). Health - Safety The action plans implemented to manage these negative impacts are presented in ESRS S1, section 4.3.2.4.1 Health and safety at work. Environment The associated action plans are available in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.4.1 The footprint of our own operations. B - Negative impacts as a customer The Purchasing Department, in charge of the Group’s purchasing policy, builds systems aimed at better understanding the negative impacts related to human rights, health & safety, ethics and the environment caused by suppliers and service providers. This department manages a responsible purchasing approach shared with the Group’s internal and external stakeholders. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has been a signatory of the Conseil National des Achats' Charte Relation Fournisseurs et Achats Responsables since 2017 and was unanimously awarded the RFAR label in June 2024 for the scope of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa banking establishment bearing bank code 15589 (Fédération du Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Fédération du Crédit Mutuel du Sud-Ouest and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa). The actions taken are consistent with the implementation of the recommendations of the European Banking Authority (EBA) as part of the outsourcing of the Group's services. These recommendations include a section on the management of negative impacts in terms of human rights, ethics, fair practices and the environment. Concerning theorganisation and governance of sustainable procurement: ■in 2020, a service provider listing and monitoring committee was set up at Group level whose missions are to: - validate the listing of service providers for critical or important services; - rule on service providers with major alerts, including on CSR matters; - monitor and control the compliance of referenced service providers, and track the progress of remediation plans; - monitor regulatory changes. In 2024, this committee met twice face-to-face and was consulted remotely on 6 occasions. ■a Responsible Purchasing Committee, created in 2023, met 3 times in 2024. This committee coordinates the implementation of the Group's responsible purchasing policy, and its main task is now to steer the roadmap for the work that will follow the award of the RFAR label in June 2024. In addition to the Purchasing Department, it involves the various stakeholder departments of the Group on this topic (Compliance and Permanent Control Department, General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, Finance and Overall Performance Department, and Organisation and Resources Department). The mapping of negative impacts relating to purchases is the cross-referencing of outstandings by purchasing category (in 2024, 62 categories) and the level of CSR impacts of the latter (four levels: low, limited, high and very high). This mapping is based on AFNOR recommendations, which the Purchasing Department has incorporated into its processes. Since the implementation of the AFNOR recommendations, the vast majority of purchases are now made in categories with a “limited” and “low” level of negative impacts (including health and safety, human rights and environmental aspects). The share of these purchasing families is rising slightly and will represent 87% of the total purchasing budget in 2023. This work has also meant that there are no longer any purchasing families with a “very high” level of negative impact. The proportion of purchases with a high level of negative impact now represents only 13% of the total amount, and is down by 6% between 2022 and 2023. Over a typical year, the Group makes 88% of its purchases from French suppliers(2). Since 2023, the Purchasing Department has been using a controversy identification tool at the sourcing stage, to detect potential controversial suppliers at an early stage. It is also used to identify, on a weekly basis, any controversies involving the Group's 1,500 main suppliers (identified on the basis of annual invoiced turnover and involvement in a service qualified as critical or important by the EBA). (1) On a permanent contract. (2) The reference period for the Group's financial consolidation is 2023. Subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the scope."
"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan 260 In addition to the AFNOR mapping, the Group has strengthened its individual knowledge of suppliers through the deployment, since 2021, of CSR questionnaires, the results of which are integrated into the purchasing process during the tender phase and in the monitoring of business relationships. The Purchasing Department's selection process for service providers also includes environmental, social and societal criteria. For services of equivalent quality, suppliers and subcontractors may be selected on the basis of criteria such as the employee compensation policy, training plans set up to promote their development or prevent risks, resource management and waste treatment policies. Specific criteria such as the use of the adapted sector, the quality of a company with a mission and obtaining the CSR label also enable us to reward companies that are virtuous in these areas. In addition, the Group's standard contracts with suppliers and service providers include clauses relating to compliance with labour law and the fight against corruption. Since 2017, the Group has had a Supplier Code of Conduct(1). By signing it, the supplier undertakes to comply with human rights principles (no use of forced and child labour, non-discrimination, etc.) and labour rights (compensation, working hours and holidays, collective bargaining, etc.), business ethics (fight against corruption, conflicts of interest, etc.) and respect for the environment. This Code of Conduct was updated in 2024 in order to broaden the scope of application (respect and protection of personal data and privacy, no recourse to illegal employment, fight against sectarian abuses, right of withdrawal, commercial practices, fight against fraud). C - Negative impacts within the framework of the Group’s financial activities As part of its financing and investment activities, the duty of care is fully integrated into the Group’s aim to strengthen the consideration of ESG issues in all its activities, in accordance with its sustainable finance roadmap. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has set up a governance structure to organise and monitor its action plans (see 4.1.2.1 Strategy, business model and value chain (SBM-1)). Each year, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa reviews its mapping of potential negative impacts on human rights, health & safety and the environment related to its financing and investments. Human Rights The Human Rights theme is not material. However, this non- materiality does not exclude it from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated the maps and associated mitigation plans. In early 2024, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa adopted a human rights policy (see 4.3.1.3 Whistleblowing, a key element in the protection of human rights). Prior to the validation of this policy, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa’s Board of Directors was trained on human rights in December 2023. In private equity, human rights due diligence is applied to the investment process and during the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices, implement a commitment process and monitor controversies. Health - Safety Health and safety is not a material issue in the downstream value chain (financing and investment). This non-materiality does not, however, exclude this subject from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated its risk maps and associated mitigation plans. Since April 2023, as part of its financing, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has taken into account the health and safety of workers through the Greta ESG risk assessment (Global Risk ESG Topics Assessment) when granting loans to companies with more than €10 million in revenues. In private equity, health and safety due diligence is an integral part of the investment process and the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices by sector, monitor any controversies and implement a commitment process. Environment Following the materiality analysis, the impacts of GHG emissions and energy consumption were identified as material. The associated action plans are presented in ESRS E1, parts: 4.2.2.4.2 Banking footprint, 4.2.2.4.3 Asset management footprint and 4.2.2.4.4 Life insurance footprint. The direct impacts on biodiversity associated with financing and investment activities have been identified as material. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E4, section 4.2.3.4 Policies, actions and targets related to financial activities. Lastly, water consumption is included in the scope of the duty of care, because of its materiality within the scope of banking activities. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E3 - 4.2.4.2 Policies, actions and targets related to banking activities.

Staff representative organisations (from the Arkade Economic and Social Unit) were involved in the development of the whistleblowing mechanism. The scheme is open to employees, service providers and subcontractors, and to anyone inside or outside the company. To make this report, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa provides the secure platform of the publisher Whistleblower Software ApS, which is accessible 24/7(1). All information communicated is encrypted and stored in this secure and independent information system, which complies with confidentiality rules. The mechanism can be used anonymously, without reprisals, and in the local language. (1) https://whistleblowersoftware.com/secure/9a9e2fab-92b6-4bfd-b90f-8331c3e3ba58/channel-select"

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 204 The maritime sector is made up of eight sub-sectors: ■the fishing, seaweed, shellfish farming and sustainable aquaculture sector; ■the seafood trade and processing sector; ■transport and freight; ■boating, yachting and ocean racing; ■shipbuilding, ship repair and infrastructure; ■marine defence, security and safety; ■marine and renewable energies; ■and a cross-disciplinary sector: sea-techs. To help reduce these pressures and direct funding towards preserving and restoring marine biodiversity and ecosystems, the Group has put in place a number of action levers: ■more specifically in the maritime transport sector, the Group has approved a dedicated policy(1) in 2024, including, for financing requests, the analysis of ESG criteria(2) dedicated specifically to climate and biodiversity issues, such as requirements linked to the ship's flag and regulations. These practices contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 on “aquatic life”(3); ■other levers for action include: - support for responsible innovation and sea-techs(4); - setting up partnerships with players working to promote sustainable practices, such as the Pôle mer Bretagne Atlantique, Ifremer, the Cluster Maritime Français and non- governmental organisations such as Pure Ocean; - investment in funds that specifically address marine biodiversity issues. 4.2.3.4 Impacts and actions at Group sites The sites that the Group owns, leases or manages are mainly offices, bank branches (local banks), staff accommodation, automated teller machines (ATMs) and social housing managed by its subsidiary Armorique Habitat. The Group also has a number of specific sites, including three catering facilities, two logistics platforms and five data centres. The Group has assessed the dependence of its own sites on biodiversity and the actual or potential negative impacts of these sites on biodiversity and ecosystems, including biodiversity-sensitive areas, as non-material due to the typology of its sites, its financial activities and the management of social housing. The analysis shows that dependencies are essentially linked to water consumption, which is assessed as low (cf. ESRS E3), and therefore not material for the Group's own sites. The analysis of the assessment of the actual or potential impact on biodiversity revealed that the possible pressures of these sites could be linked to land reclamation, water and waste management. Given the location of these sites in urban areas, on the outskirts of or within towns or small conurbations, the low consumption of water and the low generation of waste, it has been concluded that the activity carried out at the Group's sites has no material negative impact on biodiversity. In addition to this overall analysis of the impact of its sites, and aware that the nature and extent of the pressures may differ depending on their location, the Group has mapped all the sites it owns, leases or manages, in order to identify those located in or near a biodiversity hotspot(5). The sites identified are located in urban or suburban areas in France and have not resulted in any additional artificialisation of the land. The assessment of the nature and extent of water consumption and waste management does not vary according to the identification of sites because of their location in or near sensitive areas. With the exception of its social housing subsidiary Armorique Habitat, the Group does not build new homes on a frequent basis. Any potential negative impacts on biodiversity are taken into account in advance via the prior planning authorisation. This authorisation incorporates environmental aspects, as specified in the Environmental Code(6), in order to limit any negative material impact. Given the low level of pressure exerted by the activities of these sites on biodiversity-sensitive areas, in terms of land artificialisation, water consumption (in relation to ESRS E3) and waste management, it has been concluded that the Group's sites have no actual or potential negative impacts. The Group has not identified any negative impact of its direct operations on threatened species. Given the low level of pressure, the Group has not put in place a specific policy to protect biodiversity and ecosystems at operational sites that it owns, leases or manages in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. However, the Group is committed to continuous improvement and has taken action by prioritising its head offices and new buildings, via BREEAM certification and the use of ecologists. The Group is not subject to regulatory requirements to implement biodiversity mitigation measures. It has not used regulatory or voluntary measures to compensate for the loss of biodiversity in its action plans.

A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place. (1) European standard 12056-1 defines grey water as wastewater with a low level of pollution, such as that produced by showers, baths, washbasins and washing machines, which can be recycled as non-potable cold water.

The EU Taxonomy is essentially: ■a common language enabling companies and investors to identify environmentally sustainable activities; ■a common metric, in the form of the sustainable percentage of the entity's exposures, the Green Asset Ratio - GAR. This metric makes it easier to compare the sustainability performance of European banks. In order for an exposure, whether a loan or a security, to be eligible for the sustainability test, its purpose (in the sense of reason, purpose) or the activity of its ultimate beneficiary, must be listed by the European Commission as likely to contribute substantially to one of the following six environmental objectives: ■climate change mitigation; ■climate change adaptation; ■sustainable use and production of water and marine resources; ■the transition to a circular economy; ■pollution prevention and control; ■protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Once an exposure is identified as eligible according to the European Commission, to be classified as environmentally sustainable, it must also meet the technical criteria defined by the regulation. This implies that the exposure: (i) contributes substantially to an environmental objective; (ii) does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives (DNSH criteria). In addition, the activity underlying the exposure must be carried out in compliance with the OECD's minimum social guarantees, thus ensuring a responsible and ethical approach. Application timetable ■from the 2021 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish annually the proportion of its exposures eligible, in accordance with the provisions of the regulation, for the first two objectives. Eligibility for the other four objectives is published from the 2024 financial year. ■since the 2023 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has published the proportion of exposures in line with the first two objectives (the Green Asset Ratio or GAR), i.e. eligible exposures that pass the three tests for alignment with the EU Taxonomy. ■from 2023 onwards, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish the aligned share of its off-balance sheet exposures, financial guarantees and assets under management. ■in addition, on 8 November 2024, the European Commission published a directive requiring banking groups to publish performance indicators for all their business segments. In response, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is publishing, from the 2024 financial year, in addition to the information already provided in the Green Asset Ratio performance indicators for life insurance and asset management activities. ■finally, from 2025 onwards, banks will publish the proportion of their on- and off-balance sheet exposures aligned with the other four objectives and publish indicators relating to fees and commissions and trading portfolios. The assessment of the eligibility and alignment of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's activities was carried out using a methodological approach that included a detailed analysis of the Group's activities, based on existing processes and reporting systems. The main methodological principles are described below. These may be revised according to changes in regulations. (1) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 208 4.2.5.2 The green asset ratio - methodology and figures for the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group The Green Asset Ratio is calculated on the basis of the Group's total assets, established in accordance with FINREP regulations(1). Assets are presented at gross value, i.e. before impairment, provision and amortisation. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio s: An activity is eligible for the Green Asset Ratio if it is defined and described in a delegated act relating to one of the six environmental objectives. The regulations have defined 15 sectors and 147 activities that fall within the scope of the Green Asset Ratio. As a result, the scope of activities eligible for the Green Asset Ratio for banking institutions includes: ■dedicated loans to individuals: - the acquisition or construction of a residential property; - energy-efficient renovation of buildings; - equipment that promotes the energy efficiency of buildings; - renewable energy technologies; - motor vehicles from 1 January 2022. - the eligible share of exposures to companies subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (2), based on the share of eligible activity published by the counterparty or the purpose of the financing (e.g., a company's exposure to the CSRD). (renewable energy, green bonds); - loans to local authorities to finance social housing or other projects whose purpose is an eligible activity according to the European Commission; - collateral obtained by seizure of real estate. The amount of eligible assets is related to the amount of of assets covered, the denominator of the Green Asset Ratiodenominator, which corresponds to the eligible items listed above, plus: ■other exposures not eligible for the Green Asset Ratio on financial and non-financial counterparties subject to the CSRD, retail customers and local authorities(3). ■exposures to companies not subject to the CSRD (financial and non-financial companies outside the European Union, small and medium-sized companies in the EU below the thresholds); ■derivatives, interbank sight loans, cash and cash equivalents and other assets(4).

The eligibility ratio (revenue view(7)) at 31 December 2024 (41%) was down 3% compared with 31 December 2023 (44%). This decrease is mainly due to the application of the FAQ of the European Commission (November 2024), which specifies that general financing for local authorities should be included in the denominator. The pro-forma version of the eligibility ratio, with application of the FAQ, as at 31 December 2023, is 42%. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio are then tested for alignment with the European Green Taxonomy. (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/534 known as FINREP (FINancial REPorting).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 257 4.6 Duty of care plan 4.6.1.1 The duty of care plan report In order to meet the requirements set by the law of 27 March 2017 relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group deploys a duty of care plan relating to risks of serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, health & safety and the environment. The Group's duty of care plan is divided into four parts: potential negative impacts as a company, as a customer in its relations with suppliers and service providers, potential negative impacts related to its financial business lines and potential negative impacts as a service provider. It has a dedicated organisation and management. Organisation, governance and management of the duty of care plan The implementation of the duty of care within the Group is coordinated by a cross-functional Steering Committee, whose role is to ensure that the duty of care is deployed by the Group’s entities, to monitor validated actions and to set out the progress plan. This committee, led by the Sustainable Finance Department of the General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, brings together the Dynamics and Human Relations, Organisation and Resources, Purchasing, Risk and Compliance and Permanent Control Departments. In 2024, it met three times. The Group's duty of care plan is also monitored through: ■indicators of the means put in place to prevent negative impacts; ■and indicators of the results of the action plans in the three areas (negative impacts as a company, as a principal, in financial activities and as a service provider), which make it possible to assess the effectiveness of the actions taken. The duty of care plan was approved by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's Executive Management Committee on 4 November 2024 and presented to the Group's Strategy and Societal Responsibility Committee on 21 January 2025. Major actions that marked the year 2024 In 2024, work was carried out to ensure the consistent implementation of the regulatory requirements of the duty of care and those of the Directive on the publication of sustainability-related information by enterprises (CSRD). As a result, work has been carried out to ensure that the mapping of the negative impacts of the CSRD and the mapping of the impact of the duty of care now constitute a single joint exercise. The methodology for identifying and assessing impacts is described in ESRS 2 (paragraph 4.1.3.2 Information on the materiality assessment process). The negative impacts assessed as material are presented in section 4.1.2.2 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and the link with the strategy and business model (SBM-3). As a result, the content of the duty of care plan has been expanded to include three new areas of negative impact assessed as material for the Group: ■negative impacts on water via the downstream value chain (banking; ■negative impacts on inclusion via products and services (own operations); ■negative impacts on customer privacy (own operations).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 259 A - Negative impacts as a company Human Rights Each year, the Group maps out the potential negative impact of its direct activities on human rights (as a company), including an analysis of changes in the geographical presence of its workforce. This analysis is obtained by cross- referencing the country where the Group's(1) workforce is based with the mapping of the levels of potential negative impact on human rights by country. The level of potential negative impacts is thus qualified as “low” for 100% of the workforce. The Group was mainly present in France, with 97.4% of the workforce at 31 December 2024, but also in one Western European country, with 2.6%of the workforce at 31 December 2024. To date, no country in which it operates has been assessed as having a high negative impact. In addition to this analysis of potential negative impacts, the Dynamics & Human Relations Department assesses the level of “net” impacts for each entity. These negative impact on human rights (discrimination including gender inequality, child labour, forced labour, indecent working conditions, lack of right to education, lack of respect for freedom of association, right to information, privacy and data protection) are all at a low level for all entities (stable compared with 2023). Despite the low level of impact, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa pays particular attention to each of these issues (see. 4.3.2.5.1 Inclusion strategy). Health - Safety The action plans implemented to manage these negative impacts are presented in ESRS S1, section 4.3.2.4.1 Health and safety at work. Environment The associated action plans are available in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.4.1 The footprint of our own operations. B - Negative impacts as a customer The Purchasing Department, in charge of the Group’s purchasing policy, builds systems aimed at better understanding the negative impacts related to human rights, health & safety, ethics and the environment caused by suppliers and service providers. This department manages a responsible purchasing approach shared with the Group’s internal and external stakeholders. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has been a signatory of the Conseil National des Achats' Charte Relation Fournisseurs et Achats Responsables since 2017 and was unanimously awarded the RFAR label in June 2024 for the scope of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa banking establishment bearing bank code 15589 (Fédération du Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Fédération du Crédit Mutuel du Sud-Ouest and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa). The actions taken are consistent with the implementation of the recommendations of the European Banking Authority (EBA) as part of the outsourcing of the Group's services. These recommendations include a section on the management of negative impacts in terms of human rights, ethics, fair practices and the environment. Concerning theorganisation and governance of sustainable procurement: ■in 2020, a service provider listing and monitoring committee was set up at Group level whose missions are to: - validate the listing of service providers for critical or important services; - rule on service providers with major alerts, including on CSR matters; - monitor and control the compliance of referenced service providers, and track the progress of remediation plans; - monitor regulatory changes. In 2024, this committee met twice face-to-face and was consulted remotely on 6 occasions. ■a Responsible Purchasing Committee, created in 2023, met 3 times in 2024. This committee coordinates the implementation of the Group's responsible purchasing policy, and its main task is now to steer the roadmap for the work that will follow the award of the RFAR label in June 2024. In addition to the Purchasing Department, it involves the various stakeholder departments of the Group on this topic (Compliance and Permanent Control Department, General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, Finance and Overall Performance Department, and Organisation and Resources Department). The mapping of negative impacts relating to purchases is the cross-referencing of outstandings by purchasing category (in 2024, 62 categories) and the level of CSR impacts of the latter (four levels: low, limited, high and very high). This mapping is based on AFNOR recommendations, which the Purchasing Department has incorporated into its processes. Since the implementation of the AFNOR recommendations, the vast majority of purchases are now made in categories with a “limited” and “low” level of negative impacts (including health and safety, human rights and environmental aspects). The share of these purchasing families is rising slightly and will represent 87% of the total purchasing budget in 2023. This work has also meant that there are no longer any purchasing families with a “very high” level of negative impact. The proportion of purchases with a high level of negative impact now represents only 13% of the total amount, and is down by 6% between 2022 and 2023. Over a typical year, the Group makes 88% of its purchases from French suppliers(2). Since 2023, the Purchasing Department has been using a controversy identification tool at the sourcing stage, to detect potential controversial suppliers at an early stage. It is also used to identify, on a weekly basis, any controversies involving the Group's 1,500 main suppliers (identified on the basis of annual invoiced turnover and involvement in a service qualified as critical or important by the EBA). (1) On a permanent contract. (2) The reference period for the Group's financial consolidation is 2023. Subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the scope."
"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan 260 In addition to the AFNOR mapping, the Group has strengthened its individual knowledge of suppliers through the deployment, since 2021, of CSR questionnaires, the results of which are integrated into the purchasing process during the tender phase and in the monitoring of business relationships. The Purchasing Department's selection process for service providers also includes environmental, social and societal criteria. For services of equivalent quality, suppliers and subcontractors may be selected on the basis of criteria such as the employee compensation policy, training plans set up to promote their development or prevent risks, resource management and waste treatment policies. Specific criteria such as the use of the adapted sector, the quality of a company with a mission and obtaining the CSR label also enable us to reward companies that are virtuous in these areas. In addition, the Group's standard contracts with suppliers and service providers include clauses relating to compliance with labour law and the fight against corruption. Since 2017, the Group has had a Supplier Code of Conduct(1). By signing it, the supplier undertakes to comply with human rights principles (no use of forced and child labour, non-discrimination, etc.) and labour rights (compensation, working hours and holidays, collective bargaining, etc.), business ethics (fight against corruption, conflicts of interest, etc.) and respect for the environment. This Code of Conduct was updated in 2024 in order to broaden the scope of application (respect and protection of personal data and privacy, no recourse to illegal employment, fight against sectarian abuses, right of withdrawal, commercial practices, fight against fraud). C - Negative impacts within the framework of the Group’s financial activities As part of its financing and investment activities, the duty of care is fully integrated into the Group’s aim to strengthen the consideration of ESG issues in all its activities, in accordance with its sustainable finance roadmap. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has set up a governance structure to organise and monitor its action plans (see 4.1.2.1 Strategy, business model and value chain (SBM-1)). Each year, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa reviews its mapping of potential negative impacts on human rights, health & safety and the environment related to its financing and investments. Human Rights The Human Rights theme is not material. However, this non- materiality does not exclude it from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated the maps and associated mitigation plans. In early 2024, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa adopted a human rights policy (see 4.3.1.3 Whistleblowing, a key element in the protection of human rights). Prior to the validation of this policy, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa’s Board of Directors was trained on human rights in December 2023. In private equity, human rights due diligence is applied to the investment process and during the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices, implement a commitment process and monitor controversies. Health - Safety Health and safety is not a material issue in the downstream value chain (financing and investment). This non-materiality does not, however, exclude this subject from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated its risk maps and associated mitigation plans. Since April 2023, as part of its financing, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has taken into account the health and safety of workers through the Greta ESG risk assessment (Global Risk ESG Topics Assessment) when granting loans to companies with more than €10 million in revenues. In private equity, health and safety due diligence is an integral part of the investment process and the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices by sector, monitor any controversies and implement a commitment process. Environment Following the materiality analysis, the impacts of GHG emissions and energy consumption were identified as material. The associated action plans are presented in ESRS E1, parts: 4.2.2.4.2 Banking footprint, 4.2.2.4.3 Asset management footprint and 4.2.2.4.4 Life insurance footprint. The direct impacts on biodiversity associated with financing and investment activities have been identified as material. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E4, section 4.2.3.4 Policies, actions and targets related to financial activities. Lastly, water consumption is included in the scope of the duty of care, because of its materiality within the scope of banking activities. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E3 - 4.2.4.2 Policies, actions and targets related to banking activities.

Staff representative organisations (from the Arkade Economic and Social Unit) were involved in the development of the whistleblowing mechanism. The scheme is open to employees, service providers and subcontractors, and to anyone inside or outside the company. To make this report, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa provides the secure platform of the publisher Whistleblower Software ApS, which is accessible 24/7(1). All information communicated is encrypted and stored in this secure and independent information system, which complies with confidentiality rules. The mechanism can be used anonymously, without reprisals, and in the local language. (1) https://whistleblowersoftware.com/secure/9a9e2fab-92b6-4bfd-b90f-8331c3e3ba58/channel-select"

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 204 The maritime sector is made up of eight sub-sectors: ■the fishing, seaweed, shellfish farming and sustainable aquaculture sector; ■the seafood trade and processing sector; ■transport and freight; ■boating, yachting and ocean racing; ■shipbuilding, ship repair and infrastructure; ■marine defence, security and safety; ■marine and renewable energies; ■and a cross-disciplinary sector: sea-techs. To help reduce these pressures and direct funding towards preserving and restoring marine biodiversity and ecosystems, the Group has put in place a number of action levers: ■more specifically in the maritime transport sector, the Group has approved a dedicated policy(1) in 2024, including, for financing requests, the analysis of ESG criteria(2) dedicated specifically to climate and biodiversity issues, such as requirements linked to the ship's flag and regulations. These practices contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 on “aquatic life”(3); ■other levers for action include: - support for responsible innovation and sea-techs(4); - setting up partnerships with players working to promote sustainable practices, such as the Pôle mer Bretagne Atlantique, Ifremer, the Cluster Maritime Français and non- governmental organisations such as Pure Ocean; - investment in funds that specifically address marine biodiversity issues. 4.2.3.4 Impacts and actions at Group sites The sites that the Group owns, leases or manages are mainly offices, bank branches (local banks), staff accommodation, automated teller machines (ATMs) and social housing managed by its subsidiary Armorique Habitat. The Group also has a number of specific sites, including three catering facilities, two logistics platforms and five data centres. The Group has assessed the dependence of its own sites on biodiversity and the actual or potential negative impacts of these sites on biodiversity and ecosystems, including biodiversity-sensitive areas, as non-material due to the typology of its sites, its financial activities and the management of social housing. The analysis shows that dependencies are essentially linked to water consumption, which is assessed as low (cf. ESRS E3), and therefore not material for the Group's own sites. The analysis of the assessment of the actual or potential impact on biodiversity revealed that the possible pressures of these sites could be linked to land reclamation, water and waste management. Given the location of these sites in urban areas, on the outskirts of or within towns or small conurbations, the low consumption of water and the low generation of waste, it has been concluded that the activity carried out at the Group's sites has no material negative impact on biodiversity. In addition to this overall analysis of the impact of its sites, and aware that the nature and extent of the pressures may differ depending on their location, the Group has mapped all the sites it owns, leases or manages, in order to identify those located in or near a biodiversity hotspot(5). The sites identified are located in urban or suburban areas in France and have not resulted in any additional artificialisation of the land. The assessment of the nature and extent of water consumption and waste management does not vary according to the identification of sites because of their location in or near sensitive areas. With the exception of its social housing subsidiary Armorique Habitat, the Group does not build new homes on a frequent basis. Any potential negative impacts on biodiversity are taken into account in advance via the prior planning authorisation. This authorisation incorporates environmental aspects, as specified in the Environmental Code(6), in order to limit any negative material impact. Given the low level of pressure exerted by the activities of these sites on biodiversity-sensitive areas, in terms of land artificialisation, water consumption (in relation to ESRS E3) and waste management, it has been concluded that the Group's sites have no actual or potential negative impacts. The Group has not identified any negative impact of its direct operations on threatened species. Given the low level of pressure, the Group has not put in place a specific policy to protect biodiversity and ecosystems at operational sites that it owns, leases or manages in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. However, the Group is committed to continuous improvement and has taken action by prioritising its head offices and new buildings, via BREEAM certification and the use of ecologists. The Group is not subject to regulatory requirements to implement biodiversity mitigation measures. It has not used regulatory or voluntary measures to compensate for the loss of biodiversity in its action plans.

A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place. (1) European standard 12056-1 defines grey water as wastewater with a low level of pollution, such as that produced by showers, baths, washbasins and washing machines, which can be recycled as non-potable cold water.

The EU Taxonomy is essentially: ■a common language enabling companies and investors to identify environmentally sustainable activities; ■a common metric, in the form of the sustainable percentage of the entity's exposures, the Green Asset Ratio - GAR. This metric makes it easier to compare the sustainability performance of European banks. In order for an exposure, whether a loan or a security, to be eligible for the sustainability test, its purpose (in the sense of reason, purpose) or the activity of its ultimate beneficiary, must be listed by the European Commission as likely to contribute substantially to one of the following six environmental objectives: ■climate change mitigation; ■climate change adaptation; ■sustainable use and production of water and marine resources; ■the transition to a circular economy; ■pollution prevention and control; ■protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Once an exposure is identified as eligible according to the European Commission, to be classified as environmentally sustainable, it must also meet the technical criteria defined by the regulation. This implies that the exposure: (i) contributes substantially to an environmental objective; (ii) does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives (DNSH criteria). In addition, the activity underlying the exposure must be carried out in compliance with the OECD's minimum social guarantees, thus ensuring a responsible and ethical approach. Application timetable ■from the 2021 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish annually the proportion of its exposures eligible, in accordance with the provisions of the regulation, for the first two objectives. Eligibility for the other four objectives is published from the 2024 financial year. ■since the 2023 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has published the proportion of exposures in line with the first two objectives (the Green Asset Ratio or GAR), i.e. eligible exposures that pass the three tests for alignment with the EU Taxonomy. ■from 2023 onwards, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish the aligned share of its off-balance sheet exposures, financial guarantees and assets under management. ■in addition, on 8 November 2024, the European Commission published a directive requiring banking groups to publish performance indicators for all their business segments. In response, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is publishing, from the 2024 financial year, in addition to the information already provided in the Green Asset Ratio performance indicators for life insurance and asset management activities. ■finally, from 2025 onwards, banks will publish the proportion of their on- and off-balance sheet exposures aligned with the other four objectives and publish indicators relating to fees and commissions and trading portfolios. The assessment of the eligibility and alignment of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's activities was carried out using a methodological approach that included a detailed analysis of the Group's activities, based on existing processes and reporting systems. The main methodological principles are described below. These may be revised according to changes in regulations. (1) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 208 4.2.5.2 The green asset ratio - methodology and figures for the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group The Green Asset Ratio is calculated on the basis of the Group's total assets, established in accordance with FINREP regulations(1). Assets are presented at gross value, i.e. before impairment, provision and amortisation. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio s: An activity is eligible for the Green Asset Ratio if it is defined and described in a delegated act relating to one of the six environmental objectives. The regulations have defined 15 sectors and 147 activities that fall within the scope of the Green Asset Ratio. As a result, the scope of activities eligible for the Green Asset Ratio for banking institutions includes: ■dedicated loans to individuals: - the acquisition or construction of a residential property; - energy-efficient renovation of buildings; - equipment that promotes the energy efficiency of buildings; - renewable energy technologies; - motor vehicles from 1 January 2022. - the eligible share of exposures to companies subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (2), based on the share of eligible activity published by the counterparty or the purpose of the financing (e.g., a company's exposure to the CSRD). (renewable energy, green bonds); - loans to local authorities to finance social housing or other projects whose purpose is an eligible activity according to the European Commission; - collateral obtained by seizure of real estate. The amount of eligible assets is related to the amount of of assets covered, the denominator of the Green Asset Ratiodenominator, which corresponds to the eligible items listed above, plus: ■other exposures not eligible for the Green Asset Ratio on financial and non-financial counterparties subject to the CSRD, retail customers and local authorities(3). ■exposures to companies not subject to the CSRD (financial and non-financial companies outside the European Union, small and medium-sized companies in the EU below the thresholds); ■derivatives, interbank sight loans, cash and cash equivalents and other assets(4).

The eligibility ratio (revenue view(7)) at 31 December 2024 (41%) was down 3% compared with 31 December 2023 (44%). This decrease is mainly due to the application of the FAQ of the European Commission (November 2024), which specifies that general financing for local authorities should be included in the denominator. The pro-forma version of the eligibility ratio, with application of the FAQ, as at 31 December 2023, is 42%. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio are then tested for alignment with the European Green Taxonomy. (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/534 known as FINREP (FINancial REPorting).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 257 4.6 Duty of care plan 4.6.1.1 The duty of care plan report In order to meet the requirements set by the law of 27 March 2017 relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group deploys a duty of care plan relating to risks of serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, health & safety and the environment. The Group's duty of care plan is divided into four parts: potential negative impacts as a company, as a customer in its relations with suppliers and service providers, potential negative impacts related to its financial business lines and potential negative impacts as a service provider. It has a dedicated organisation and management. Organisation, governance and management of the duty of care plan The implementation of the duty of care within the Group is coordinated by a cross-functional Steering Committee, whose role is to ensure that the duty of care is deployed by the Group’s entities, to monitor validated actions and to set out the progress plan. This committee, led by the Sustainable Finance Department of the General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, brings together the Dynamics and Human Relations, Organisation and Resources, Purchasing, Risk and Compliance and Permanent Control Departments. In 2024, it met three times. The Group's duty of care plan is also monitored through: ■indicators of the means put in place to prevent negative impacts; ■and indicators of the results of the action plans in the three areas (negative impacts as a company, as a principal, in financial activities and as a service provider), which make it possible to assess the effectiveness of the actions taken. The duty of care plan was approved by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's Executive Management Committee on 4 November 2024 and presented to the Group's Strategy and Societal Responsibility Committee on 21 January 2025. Major actions that marked the year 2024 In 2024, work was carried out to ensure the consistent implementation of the regulatory requirements of the duty of care and those of the Directive on the publication of sustainability-related information by enterprises (CSRD). As a result, work has been carried out to ensure that the mapping of the negative impacts of the CSRD and the mapping of the impact of the duty of care now constitute a single joint exercise. The methodology for identifying and assessing impacts is described in ESRS 2 (paragraph 4.1.3.2 Information on the materiality assessment process). The negative impacts assessed as material are presented in section 4.1.2.2 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and the link with the strategy and business model (SBM-3). As a result, the content of the duty of care plan has been expanded to include three new areas of negative impact assessed as material for the Group: ■negative impacts on water via the downstream value chain (banking; ■negative impacts on inclusion via products and services (own operations); ■negative impacts on customer privacy (own operations).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 259 A - Negative impacts as a company Human Rights Each year, the Group maps out the potential negative impact of its direct activities on human rights (as a company), including an analysis of changes in the geographical presence of its workforce. This analysis is obtained by cross- referencing the country where the Group's(1) workforce is based with the mapping of the levels of potential negative impact on human rights by country. The level of potential negative impacts is thus qualified as “low” for 100% of the workforce. The Group was mainly present in France, with 97.4% of the workforce at 31 December 2024, but also in one Western European country, with 2.6%of the workforce at 31 December 2024. To date, no country in which it operates has been assessed as having a high negative impact. In addition to this analysis of potential negative impacts, the Dynamics & Human Relations Department assesses the level of “net” impacts for each entity. These negative impact on human rights (discrimination including gender inequality, child labour, forced labour, indecent working conditions, lack of right to education, lack of respect for freedom of association, right to information, privacy and data protection) are all at a low level for all entities (stable compared with 2023). Despite the low level of impact, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa pays particular attention to each of these issues (see. 4.3.2.5.1 Inclusion strategy). Health - Safety The action plans implemented to manage these negative impacts are presented in ESRS S1, section 4.3.2.4.1 Health and safety at work. Environment The associated action plans are available in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.4.1 The footprint of our own operations. B - Negative impacts as a customer The Purchasing Department, in charge of the Group’s purchasing policy, builds systems aimed at better understanding the negative impacts related to human rights, health & safety, ethics and the environment caused by suppliers and service providers. This department manages a responsible purchasing approach shared with the Group’s internal and external stakeholders. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has been a signatory of the Conseil National des Achats' Charte Relation Fournisseurs et Achats Responsables since 2017 and was unanimously awarded the RFAR label in June 2024 for the scope of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa banking establishment bearing bank code 15589 (Fédération du Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Fédération du Crédit Mutuel du Sud-Ouest and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa). The actions taken are consistent with the implementation of the recommendations of the European Banking Authority (EBA) as part of the outsourcing of the Group's services. These recommendations include a section on the management of negative impacts in terms of human rights, ethics, fair practices and the environment. Concerning theorganisation and governance of sustainable procurement: ■in 2020, a service provider listing and monitoring committee was set up at Group level whose missions are to: - validate the listing of service providers for critical or important services; - rule on service providers with major alerts, including on CSR matters; - monitor and control the compliance of referenced service providers, and track the progress of remediation plans; - monitor regulatory changes. In 2024, this committee met twice face-to-face and was consulted remotely on 6 occasions. ■a Responsible Purchasing Committee, created in 2023, met 3 times in 2024. This committee coordinates the implementation of the Group's responsible purchasing policy, and its main task is now to steer the roadmap for the work that will follow the award of the RFAR label in June 2024. In addition to the Purchasing Department, it involves the various stakeholder departments of the Group on this topic (Compliance and Permanent Control Department, General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, Finance and Overall Performance Department, and Organisation and Resources Department). The mapping of negative impacts relating to purchases is the cross-referencing of outstandings by purchasing category (in 2024, 62 categories) and the level of CSR impacts of the latter (four levels: low, limited, high and very high). This mapping is based on AFNOR recommendations, which the Purchasing Department has incorporated into its processes. Since the implementation of the AFNOR recommendations, the vast majority of purchases are now made in categories with a “limited” and “low” level of negative impacts (including health and safety, human rights and environmental aspects). The share of these purchasing families is rising slightly and will represent 87% of the total purchasing budget in 2023. This work has also meant that there are no longer any purchasing families with a “very high” level of negative impact. The proportion of purchases with a high level of negative impact now represents only 13% of the total amount, and is down by 6% between 2022 and 2023. Over a typical year, the Group makes 88% of its purchases from French suppliers(2). Since 2023, the Purchasing Department has been using a controversy identification tool at the sourcing stage, to detect potential controversial suppliers at an early stage. It is also used to identify, on a weekly basis, any controversies involving the Group's 1,500 main suppliers (identified on the basis of annual invoiced turnover and involvement in a service qualified as critical or important by the EBA). (1) On a permanent contract. (2) The reference period for the Group's financial consolidation is 2023. Subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the scope."
"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan 260 In addition to the AFNOR mapping, the Group has strengthened its individual knowledge of suppliers through the deployment, since 2021, of CSR questionnaires, the results of which are integrated into the purchasing process during the tender phase and in the monitoring of business relationships. The Purchasing Department's selection process for service providers also includes environmental, social and societal criteria. For services of equivalent quality, suppliers and subcontractors may be selected on the basis of criteria such as the employee compensation policy, training plans set up to promote their development or prevent risks, resource management and waste treatment policies. Specific criteria such as the use of the adapted sector, the quality of a company with a mission and obtaining the CSR label also enable us to reward companies that are virtuous in these areas. In addition, the Group's standard contracts with suppliers and service providers include clauses relating to compliance with labour law and the fight against corruption. Since 2017, the Group has had a Supplier Code of Conduct(1). By signing it, the supplier undertakes to comply with human rights principles (no use of forced and child labour, non-discrimination, etc.) and labour rights (compensation, working hours and holidays, collective bargaining, etc.), business ethics (fight against corruption, conflicts of interest, etc.) and respect for the environment. This Code of Conduct was updated in 2024 in order to broaden the scope of application (respect and protection of personal data and privacy, no recourse to illegal employment, fight against sectarian abuses, right of withdrawal, commercial practices, fight against fraud). C - Negative impacts within the framework of the Group’s financial activities As part of its financing and investment activities, the duty of care is fully integrated into the Group’s aim to strengthen the consideration of ESG issues in all its activities, in accordance with its sustainable finance roadmap. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has set up a governance structure to organise and monitor its action plans (see 4.1.2.1 Strategy, business model and value chain (SBM-1)). Each year, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa reviews its mapping of potential negative impacts on human rights, health & safety and the environment related to its financing and investments. Human Rights The Human Rights theme is not material. However, this non- materiality does not exclude it from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated the maps and associated mitigation plans. In early 2024, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa adopted a human rights policy (see 4.3.1.3 Whistleblowing, a key element in the protection of human rights). Prior to the validation of this policy, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa’s Board of Directors was trained on human rights in December 2023. In private equity, human rights due diligence is applied to the investment process and during the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices, implement a commitment process and monitor controversies. Health - Safety Health and safety is not a material issue in the downstream value chain (financing and investment). This non-materiality does not, however, exclude this subject from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated its risk maps and associated mitigation plans. Since April 2023, as part of its financing, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has taken into account the health and safety of workers through the Greta ESG risk assessment (Global Risk ESG Topics Assessment) when granting loans to companies with more than €10 million in revenues. In private equity, health and safety due diligence is an integral part of the investment process and the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices by sector, monitor any controversies and implement a commitment process. Environment Following the materiality analysis, the impacts of GHG emissions and energy consumption were identified as material. The associated action plans are presented in ESRS E1, parts: 4.2.2.4.2 Banking footprint, 4.2.2.4.3 Asset management footprint and 4.2.2.4.4 Life insurance footprint. The direct impacts on biodiversity associated with financing and investment activities have been identified as material. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E4, section 4.2.3.4 Policies, actions and targets related to financial activities. Lastly, water consumption is included in the scope of the duty of care, because of its materiality within the scope of banking activities. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E3 - 4.2.4.2 Policies, actions and targets related to banking activities.

Staff representative organisations (from the Arkade Economic and Social Unit) were involved in the development of the whistleblowing mechanism. The scheme is open to employees, service providers and subcontractors, and to anyone inside or outside the company. To make this report, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa provides the secure platform of the publisher Whistleblower Software ApS, which is accessible 24/7(1). All information communicated is encrypted and stored in this secure and independent information system, which complies with confidentiality rules. The mechanism can be used anonymously, without reprisals, and in the local language. (1) https://whistleblowersoftware.com/secure/9a9e2fab-92b6-4bfd-b90f-8331c3e3ba58/channel-select"

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 204 The maritime sector is made up of eight sub-sectors: ■the fishing, seaweed, shellfish farming and sustainable aquaculture sector; ■the seafood trade and processing sector; ■transport and freight; ■boating, yachting and ocean racing; ■shipbuilding, ship repair and infrastructure; ■marine defence, security and safety; ■marine and renewable energies; ■and a cross-disciplinary sector: sea-techs. To help reduce these pressures and direct funding towards preserving and restoring marine biodiversity and ecosystems, the Group has put in place a number of action levers: ■more specifically in the maritime transport sector, the Group has approved a dedicated policy(1) in 2024, including, for financing requests, the analysis of ESG criteria(2) dedicated specifically to climate and biodiversity issues, such as requirements linked to the ship's flag and regulations. These practices contribute to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 14 on “aquatic life”(3); ■other levers for action include: - support for responsible innovation and sea-techs(4); - setting up partnerships with players working to promote sustainable practices, such as the Pôle mer Bretagne Atlantique, Ifremer, the Cluster Maritime Français and non- governmental organisations such as Pure Ocean; - investment in funds that specifically address marine biodiversity issues. 4.2.3.4 Impacts and actions at Group sites The sites that the Group owns, leases or manages are mainly offices, bank branches (local banks), staff accommodation, automated teller machines (ATMs) and social housing managed by its subsidiary Armorique Habitat. The Group also has a number of specific sites, including three catering facilities, two logistics platforms and five data centres. The Group has assessed the dependence of its own sites on biodiversity and the actual or potential negative impacts of these sites on biodiversity and ecosystems, including biodiversity-sensitive areas, as non-material due to the typology of its sites, its financial activities and the management of social housing. The analysis shows that dependencies are essentially linked to water consumption, which is assessed as low (cf. ESRS E3), and therefore not material for the Group's own sites. The analysis of the assessment of the actual or potential impact on biodiversity revealed that the possible pressures of these sites could be linked to land reclamation, water and waste management. Given the location of these sites in urban areas, on the outskirts of or within towns or small conurbations, the low consumption of water and the low generation of waste, it has been concluded that the activity carried out at the Group's sites has no material negative impact on biodiversity. In addition to this overall analysis of the impact of its sites, and aware that the nature and extent of the pressures may differ depending on their location, the Group has mapped all the sites it owns, leases or manages, in order to identify those located in or near a biodiversity hotspot(5). The sites identified are located in urban or suburban areas in France and have not resulted in any additional artificialisation of the land. The assessment of the nature and extent of water consumption and waste management does not vary according to the identification of sites because of their location in or near sensitive areas. With the exception of its social housing subsidiary Armorique Habitat, the Group does not build new homes on a frequent basis. Any potential negative impacts on biodiversity are taken into account in advance via the prior planning authorisation. This authorisation incorporates environmental aspects, as specified in the Environmental Code(6), in order to limit any negative material impact. Given the low level of pressure exerted by the activities of these sites on biodiversity-sensitive areas, in terms of land artificialisation, water consumption (in relation to ESRS E3) and waste management, it has been concluded that the Group's sites have no actual or potential negative impacts. The Group has not identified any negative impact of its direct operations on threatened species. Given the low level of pressure, the Group has not put in place a specific policy to protect biodiversity and ecosystems at operational sites that it owns, leases or manages in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. However, the Group is committed to continuous improvement and has taken action by prioritising its head offices and new buildings, via BREEAM certification and the use of ecologists. The Group is not subject to regulatory requirements to implement biodiversity mitigation measures. It has not used regulatory or voluntary measures to compensate for the loss of biodiversity in its action plans.

A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place. (1) European standard 12056-1 defines grey water as wastewater with a low level of pollution, such as that produced by showers, baths, washbasins and washing machines, which can be recycled as non-potable cold water.

The EU Taxonomy is essentially: ■a common language enabling companies and investors to identify environmentally sustainable activities; ■a common metric, in the form of the sustainable percentage of the entity's exposures, the Green Asset Ratio - GAR. This metric makes it easier to compare the sustainability performance of European banks. In order for an exposure, whether a loan or a security, to be eligible for the sustainability test, its purpose (in the sense of reason, purpose) or the activity of its ultimate beneficiary, must be listed by the European Commission as likely to contribute substantially to one of the following six environmental objectives: ■climate change mitigation; ■climate change adaptation; ■sustainable use and production of water and marine resources; ■the transition to a circular economy; ■pollution prevention and control; ■protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. Once an exposure is identified as eligible according to the European Commission, to be classified as environmentally sustainable, it must also meet the technical criteria defined by the regulation. This implies that the exposure: (i) contributes substantially to an environmental objective; (ii) does not cause significant harm to other environmental objectives (DNSH criteria). In addition, the activity underlying the exposure must be carried out in compliance with the OECD's minimum social guarantees, thus ensuring a responsible and ethical approach. Application timetable ■from the 2021 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish annually the proportion of its exposures eligible, in accordance with the provisions of the regulation, for the first two objectives. Eligibility for the other four objectives is published from the 2024 financial year. ■since the 2023 financial year, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has published the proportion of exposures in line with the first two objectives (the Green Asset Ratio or GAR), i.e. eligible exposures that pass the three tests for alignment with the EU Taxonomy. ■from 2023 onwards, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group will publish the aligned share of its off-balance sheet exposures, financial guarantees and assets under management. ■in addition, on 8 November 2024, the European Commission published a directive requiring banking groups to publish performance indicators for all their business segments. In response, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is publishing, from the 2024 financial year, in addition to the information already provided in the Green Asset Ratio performance indicators for life insurance and asset management activities. ■finally, from 2025 onwards, banks will publish the proportion of their on- and off-balance sheet exposures aligned with the other four objectives and publish indicators relating to fees and commissions and trading portfolios. The assessment of the eligibility and alignment of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's activities was carried out using a methodological approach that included a detailed analysis of the Group's activities, based on existing processes and reporting systems. The main methodological principles are described below. These may be revised according to changes in regulations. (1) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information 208 4.2.5.2 The green asset ratio - methodology and figures for the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group The Green Asset Ratio is calculated on the basis of the Group's total assets, established in accordance with FINREP regulations(1). Assets are presented at gross value, i.e. before impairment, provision and amortisation. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio s: An activity is eligible for the Green Asset Ratio if it is defined and described in a delegated act relating to one of the six environmental objectives. The regulations have defined 15 sectors and 147 activities that fall within the scope of the Green Asset Ratio. As a result, the scope of activities eligible for the Green Asset Ratio for banking institutions includes: ■dedicated loans to individuals: - the acquisition or construction of a residential property; - energy-efficient renovation of buildings; - equipment that promotes the energy efficiency of buildings; - renewable energy technologies; - motor vehicles from 1 January 2022. - the eligible share of exposures to companies subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) (2), based on the share of eligible activity published by the counterparty or the purpose of the financing (e.g., a company's exposure to the CSRD). (renewable energy, green bonds); - loans to local authorities to finance social housing or other projects whose purpose is an eligible activity according to the European Commission; - collateral obtained by seizure of real estate. The amount of eligible assets is related to the amount of of assets covered, the denominator of the Green Asset Ratiodenominator, which corresponds to the eligible items listed above, plus: ■other exposures not eligible for the Green Asset Ratio on financial and non-financial counterparties subject to the CSRD, retail customers and local authorities(3). ■exposures to companies not subject to the CSRD (financial and non-financial companies outside the European Union, small and medium-sized companies in the EU below the thresholds); ■derivatives, interbank sight loans, cash and cash equivalents and other assets(4).

The eligibility ratio (revenue view(7)) at 31 December 2024 (41%) was down 3% compared with 31 December 2023 (44%). This decrease is mainly due to the application of the FAQ of the European Commission (November 2024), which specifies that general financing for local authorities should be included in the denominator. The pro-forma version of the eligibility ratio, with application of the FAQ, as at 31 December 2023, is 42%. Assets eligible for the Green Asset Ratio are then tested for alignment with the European Green Taxonomy. (1) Regulation (EU) 2015/534 known as FINREP (FINancial REPorting).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 257 4.6 Duty of care plan 4.6.1.1 The duty of care plan report In order to meet the requirements set by the law of 27 March 2017 relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group deploys a duty of care plan relating to risks of serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, health & safety and the environment. The Group's duty of care plan is divided into four parts: potential negative impacts as a company, as a customer in its relations with suppliers and service providers, potential negative impacts related to its financial business lines and potential negative impacts as a service provider. It has a dedicated organisation and management. Organisation, governance and management of the duty of care plan The implementation of the duty of care within the Group is coordinated by a cross-functional Steering Committee, whose role is to ensure that the duty of care is deployed by the Group’s entities, to monitor validated actions and to set out the progress plan. This committee, led by the Sustainable Finance Department of the General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, brings together the Dynamics and Human Relations, Organisation and Resources, Purchasing, Risk and Compliance and Permanent Control Departments. In 2024, it met three times. The Group's duty of care plan is also monitored through: ■indicators of the means put in place to prevent negative impacts; ■and indicators of the results of the action plans in the three areas (negative impacts as a company, as a principal, in financial activities and as a service provider), which make it possible to assess the effectiveness of the actions taken. The duty of care plan was approved by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group's Executive Management Committee on 4 November 2024 and presented to the Group's Strategy and Societal Responsibility Committee on 21 January 2025. Major actions that marked the year 2024 In 2024, work was carried out to ensure the consistent implementation of the regulatory requirements of the duty of care and those of the Directive on the publication of sustainability-related information by enterprises (CSRD). As a result, work has been carried out to ensure that the mapping of the negative impacts of the CSRD and the mapping of the impact of the duty of care now constitute a single joint exercise. The methodology for identifying and assessing impacts is described in ESRS 2 (paragraph 4.1.3.2 Information on the materiality assessment process). The negative impacts assessed as material are presented in section 4.1.2.2 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and the link with the strategy and business model (SBM-3). As a result, the content of the duty of care plan has been expanded to include three new areas of negative impact assessed as material for the Group: ■negative impacts on water via the downstream value chain (banking; ■negative impacts on inclusion via products and services (own operations); ■negative impacts on customer privacy (own operations).

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 259 A - Negative impacts as a company Human Rights Each year, the Group maps out the potential negative impact of its direct activities on human rights (as a company), including an analysis of changes in the geographical presence of its workforce. This analysis is obtained by cross- referencing the country where the Group's(1) workforce is based with the mapping of the levels of potential negative impact on human rights by country. The level of potential negative impacts is thus qualified as “low” for 100% of the workforce. The Group was mainly present in France, with 97.4% of the workforce at 31 December 2024, but also in one Western European country, with 2.6%of the workforce at 31 December 2024. To date, no country in which it operates has been assessed as having a high negative impact. In addition to this analysis of potential negative impacts, the Dynamics & Human Relations Department assesses the level of “net” impacts for each entity. These negative impact on human rights (discrimination including gender inequality, child labour, forced labour, indecent working conditions, lack of right to education, lack of respect for freedom of association, right to information, privacy and data protection) are all at a low level for all entities (stable compared with 2023). Despite the low level of impact, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa pays particular attention to each of these issues (see. 4.3.2.5.1 Inclusion strategy). Health - Safety The action plans implemented to manage these negative impacts are presented in ESRS S1, section 4.3.2.4.1 Health and safety at work. Environment The associated action plans are available in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.4.1 The footprint of our own operations. B - Negative impacts as a customer The Purchasing Department, in charge of the Group’s purchasing policy, builds systems aimed at better understanding the negative impacts related to human rights, health & safety, ethics and the environment caused by suppliers and service providers. This department manages a responsible purchasing approach shared with the Group’s internal and external stakeholders. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has been a signatory of the Conseil National des Achats' Charte Relation Fournisseurs et Achats Responsables since 2017 and was unanimously awarded the RFAR label in June 2024 for the scope of the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa banking establishment bearing bank code 15589 (Fédération du Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Fédération du Crédit Mutuel du Sud-Ouest and affiliated Crédit Mutuel branches, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa). The actions taken are consistent with the implementation of the recommendations of the European Banking Authority (EBA) as part of the outsourcing of the Group's services. These recommendations include a section on the management of negative impacts in terms of human rights, ethics, fair practices and the environment. Concerning theorganisation and governance of sustainable procurement: ■in 2020, a service provider listing and monitoring committee was set up at Group level whose missions are to: - validate the listing of service providers for critical or important services; - rule on service providers with major alerts, including on CSR matters; - monitor and control the compliance of referenced service providers, and track the progress of remediation plans; - monitor regulatory changes. In 2024, this committee met twice face-to-face and was consulted remotely on 6 occasions. ■a Responsible Purchasing Committee, created in 2023, met 3 times in 2024. This committee coordinates the implementation of the Group's responsible purchasing policy, and its main task is now to steer the roadmap for the work that will follow the award of the RFAR label in June 2024. In addition to the Purchasing Department, it involves the various stakeholder departments of the Group on this topic (Compliance and Permanent Control Department, General Secretary and Institutional Communications Department, Finance and Overall Performance Department, and Organisation and Resources Department). The mapping of negative impacts relating to purchases is the cross-referencing of outstandings by purchasing category (in 2024, 62 categories) and the level of CSR impacts of the latter (four levels: low, limited, high and very high). This mapping is based on AFNOR recommendations, which the Purchasing Department has incorporated into its processes. Since the implementation of the AFNOR recommendations, the vast majority of purchases are now made in categories with a “limited” and “low” level of negative impacts (including health and safety, human rights and environmental aspects). The share of these purchasing families is rising slightly and will represent 87% of the total purchasing budget in 2023. This work has also meant that there are no longer any purchasing families with a “very high” level of negative impact. The proportion of purchases with a high level of negative impact now represents only 13% of the total amount, and is down by 6% between 2022 and 2023. Over a typical year, the Group makes 88% of its purchases from French suppliers(2). Since 2023, the Purchasing Department has been using a controversy identification tool at the sourcing stage, to detect potential controversial suppliers at an early stage. It is also used to identify, on a weekly basis, any controversies involving the Group's 1,500 main suppliers (identified on the basis of annual invoiced turnover and involvement in a service qualified as critical or important by the EBA). (1) On a permanent contract. (2) The reference period for the Group's financial consolidation is 2023. Subsidiaries accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the scope."
"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Duty of care plan 260 In addition to the AFNOR mapping, the Group has strengthened its individual knowledge of suppliers through the deployment, since 2021, of CSR questionnaires, the results of which are integrated into the purchasing process during the tender phase and in the monitoring of business relationships. The Purchasing Department's selection process for service providers also includes environmental, social and societal criteria. For services of equivalent quality, suppliers and subcontractors may be selected on the basis of criteria such as the employee compensation policy, training plans set up to promote their development or prevent risks, resource management and waste treatment policies. Specific criteria such as the use of the adapted sector, the quality of a company with a mission and obtaining the CSR label also enable us to reward companies that are virtuous in these areas. In addition, the Group's standard contracts with suppliers and service providers include clauses relating to compliance with labour law and the fight against corruption. Since 2017, the Group has had a Supplier Code of Conduct(1). By signing it, the supplier undertakes to comply with human rights principles (no use of forced and child labour, non-discrimination, etc.) and labour rights (compensation, working hours and holidays, collective bargaining, etc.), business ethics (fight against corruption, conflicts of interest, etc.) and respect for the environment. This Code of Conduct was updated in 2024 in order to broaden the scope of application (respect and protection of personal data and privacy, no recourse to illegal employment, fight against sectarian abuses, right of withdrawal, commercial practices, fight against fraud). C - Negative impacts within the framework of the Group’s financial activities As part of its financing and investment activities, the duty of care is fully integrated into the Group’s aim to strengthen the consideration of ESG issues in all its activities, in accordance with its sustainable finance roadmap. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has set up a governance structure to organise and monitor its action plans (see 4.1.2.1 Strategy, business model and value chain (SBM-1)). Each year, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa reviews its mapping of potential negative impacts on human rights, health & safety and the environment related to its financing and investments. Human Rights The Human Rights theme is not material. However, this non- materiality does not exclude it from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated the maps and associated mitigation plans. In early 2024, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa adopted a human rights policy (see 4.3.1.3 Whistleblowing, a key element in the protection of human rights). Prior to the validation of this policy, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa’s Board of Directors was trained on human rights in December 2023. In private equity, human rights due diligence is applied to the investment process and during the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices, implement a commitment process and monitor controversies. Health - Safety Health and safety is not a material issue in the downstream value chain (financing and investment). This non-materiality does not, however, exclude this subject from the scope of the duty of care. Crédit Mutuel Arkéa has updated its risk maps and associated mitigation plans. Since April 2023, as part of its financing, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group has taken into account the health and safety of workers through the Greta ESG risk assessment (Global Risk ESG Topics Assessment) when granting loans to companies with more than €10 million in revenues. In private equity, health and safety due diligence is an integral part of the investment process and the holding phase. In asset management, Arkéa Asset Management relies on a data provider to select the best players in terms of ESG practices by sector, monitor any controversies and implement a commitment process. Environment Following the materiality analysis, the impacts of GHG emissions and energy consumption were identified as material. The associated action plans are presented in ESRS E1, parts: 4.2.2.4.2 Banking footprint, 4.2.2.4.3 Asset management footprint and 4.2.2.4.4 Life insurance footprint. The direct impacts on biodiversity associated with financing and investment activities have been identified as material. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E4, section 4.2.3.4 Policies, actions and targets related to financial activities. Lastly, water consumption is included in the scope of the duty of care, because of its materiality within the scope of banking activities. The associated action plans are available in ESRS E3 - 4.2.4.2 Policies, actions and targets related to banking activities.

The associated action plans are available in the ESRS S4, part 4.3.3.3 Financial and social inclusion. Privacy The impacts on the privacy of the Group’s customers due to a lack of protection or inappropriate use of data have been identified as material. The associated action plans are available in ESRS S4, section 4.3.3.6 Protection of privacy. 4.6.1.2 Whistleblowing mechanism A whistleblowing and reporting system dedicated to serious health & safety risks, human rights and the environment has been in place since 2018. Staff representative organisations (from the Arkade Economic and Social Unit) were involved in the development of the whistleblowing mechanism. The scheme is open to employees, service providers and subcontractors, and to anyone inside or outside the company. To make this report, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa provides the secure platform of the publisher Whistleblower Software ApS, which is accessible 24/7(1). All information communicated is encrypted and stored in this secure and independent information system, which complies with confidentiality rules. The mechanism can be used anonymously, without reprisals, and in the local language. (1) https://whistleblowersoftware.com/secure/9a9e2fab-92b6-4bfd-b90f-8331c3e3ba58/channel-select"

"4 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT General information (ESRS 2) CRÉDIT MUTUEL ARKÉA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 153 Financial materiality The impact materiality assessment was based on a risk/opportunity matrix combining two dimensions: ■the probability of occurrence of the risk or opportunity (frequency); ■the severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity (potential scale on the financial effects). Probability is defined as the likelihood of the risk occurring in the short, medium and long term. It is based on a 5-level rating scale (unlikely, not very likely, possible, likely, very likely) which takes qualitative account of short, medium and long-term time horizons. The severity of the risk or the scale of the opportunity corresponds to the estimated impact on the company's financial position, financial performance, cash flows, access to financing or cost of capital in the short, medium or long term. It is based on a 5-level scale that incorporates ranges of quantitative financial effects. The probability and severity/magnitude ratings are based on a series of quantitative and qualitative studies for environmental issues, and on expert qualitative justification for social and governance issues. Risk identification and assessment methodology The process of identifying and assessing sustainability risks is based on an in-depth analysis of the risks, resulting from negative impacts and dependencies, and their propagation to the main banking and financial risks via transmission channels. These analyses were carried out on the basis of workshops that concluded with expert assessments of probability and severity. The financial materiality thresholds are based on thresholds that already exist in the Group's risk methodologies. The nature of the effects of risks can be assessed according to two broad categories: ■direct financial effects, such as penalties and fines linked to non-compliance with various regulations, losses linked to the interruption of economic activity or investment in technological upgrades; ■indirect financial effects via the value chain, which is also impacted by the various sustainability risks that can affect the ability to repay a loan, for the downstream value chain, or to provide a service, for the upstream value chain. By analysing the transmission of these risks, we can identify and assess risks throughout the value chain: ■on own operations via operational risk, strategic risk and insurance risk; ■on the upstream value chain via operational risk; ■on the downstream value chain via credit risk and insurance risk. The risk hierarchy matrix used by the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group and the associated probability and severity scales are defined above in the section entitled “Summary approach to the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities”. These matrices can be used to rank and prioritise sustainability risks. The risk identification and assessment procedure is integrated into the company's overall risk management process and has fed into the various sustainability risk management systems within the Group. Firstly, with regard to environmental risks, the various materiality matrices (climate risks, risks of biodiversity loss, risks associated with aquatic and marine resources, pollution risks, risks associated with the use of resources and the circular economy) and the associated probability and severity ratings are incorporated into the environmental risk management policy, which complements the pre-existing internal policies for each type of risk. Policies for other types of risk are also gradually being enriched with issues relating to environmental risks. These measurements and analyses enable the Group to identify assets and economic activities that are difficult to reconcile with a transition to a climate-neutral economy, and to take action to limit the emissions that are locked in. Dependence on customers' natural resources has been taken into account in the analysis of physical risks in relation to the sectoral dependence and impact factors in the ENCORE database. Secondly, with regard to social risks, the results of the identification of risks and the assessment of their financial materiality have also been integrated into the social risk management policy, initiated in 2024. It is also planned to set out the governance-related risks in a risk management policy at a later date, using the results of the risk identification and assessment process. Sustainability risks have been integrated into Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's risk mapping via the main risk factors below: ■climate transition risks; ■physical climate risks; ■transition risks related to biodiversity loss; ■physical risks related to biodiversity loss; ■corporate risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities); ■governance risks (for own accounts and via financing and investment activities). With regard to environmental risks, the financial materiality analysis is based on qualitative as well as quantitative studies, in particular the following resources:"

A sustainability issue is material if it leads in the short, medium or long term to opportunities that have an impact on: ■financial position: ■financial performance: ■cash flow; ■access to finance or the cost of capital; ■non-financial capital. The identification and assessment of opportunities was based on existing work, both external and internal: ■identification and assessment through analyses based on external studies; ■identification of the challenges and gathering of information on the scale and likelihood of opportunities in the areas where the Group is present (worldwide, France and even regions if data is available); ■identification through strategic studies of Crédit Mutuel Arkéa's Strategic Plan and the commitments already made by the Group (Principles for Responsible Banking, Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, etc.) ; ■for all opportunities identified: an internal analysis of the nature of the opportunity and the expected consequences for the Group has been carried out to establish the scale and probability ratings, according to expert opinion. Internal experts have been called in, where necessary, to confirm certain analyses. With regard to climate change, the Group drew in particular on data from the National Low Carbon Strategy, France's roadmap for implementing a climate change mitigation policy consistent with the Paris Agreement. With regard to biodiversity, no scenario analysis was used for this assessment. Opportunities will be regularly reassessed to take account of external changes (regulatory, technological, customer expectations, etc.) as well as developments in the Group's various business lines.
