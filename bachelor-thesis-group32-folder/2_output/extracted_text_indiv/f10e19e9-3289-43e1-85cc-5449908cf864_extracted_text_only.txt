"actions and targets relating to banking activities Adaptation of the Company with Mission roadmap to 2027 2027 target Base year (2024) Milestones, intermediate targets Supporting the sectors of the region that are most dependent on and have the greatest impact on water resources (commitment #4) Deploying the first actions in line with the water policy 2025: implement a diagnosis of financing/ investment portfolios 2026: define a strategy to support corporate clients on the theme of water The Group is aware of the importance of this natural resource for its territories, its stakeholders and consequently for its business model. A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices.

"actions and targets relating to banking activities Adaptation of the Company with Mission roadmap to 2027 2027 target Base year (2024) Milestones, intermediate targets Supporting the sectors of the region that are most dependent on and have the greatest impact on water resources (commitment #4) Deploying the first actions in line with the water policy 2025: implement a diagnosis of financing/ investment portfolios 2026: define a strategy to support corporate clients on the theme of water The Group is aware of the importance of this natural resource for its territories, its stakeholders and consequently for its business model. A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place.
