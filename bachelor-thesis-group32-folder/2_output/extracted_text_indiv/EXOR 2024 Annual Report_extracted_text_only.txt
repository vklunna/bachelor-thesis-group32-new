"2.2 Emissions reduction and climate change. Risks and opportunities were identified starting from impacts and dependencies on resources and relationships, and in line with Exor's risk assessment and prior year TCFD reports. When assessing impact materiality, Exor addressed actual and potential negative impacts based on an average scoring of their scale, scope and irremediable character multiplied by likelihood. In the specific case of potential negative impacts on human rights, the scale was weighted as a more important factor than likelihood. For positive impacts, Exor used an average scoring of their scale and scope multiplied by likelihood. When assessing financial materiality, Exor addressed likelihood, magnitude (including the nature of the financial effects of the identified risks and opportunities), in line with the methodology and assessment used in Exor’s risk assessment and prior year TCFD reports. In performing the overall risk assessment sustainability-related risks were evaluated in the same manner as other risks to which Exor is exposed without giving a higher level of priority. Exor's risk assessment does not yet integrate all of the risks identified in the DMA process, however in the future an alignment exercise will be conducted.

"2.2 Emissions reduction and climate change Relevant sub-topics Impacts, risks and opportunities Climate change adaptation Risk in own operations: investment entities whose investments are in high-emissions sectors can potentially risk poorer investment returns as markets and regulations transition to a greener economic model. Other potential factors that could lead to weaker investment returns include technological shifts, fluctuations in supply and demand and policy changes. (Short-Medium-Long Term) Risk in the value chain: business interruptions, loss in revenues, reduced product availability and an increase in repair costs or damaged buildings at an investee level caused by extreme weather events (hurricane, floods) as well as longer shifts in climate patterns potentially leading to droughts, heat waves and water stress. (Short-Medium term) Climate change mitigation Negative actual impact in the value chain: GHG emissions generated by the motor vehicle sector contributing to climate change (including resource extraction and production of materials, transport, industrial processes, GHG emissions from the vehicles sold and the vehicles' end of life). (Short-Medium-Long term) Positive actual impact in the value chain: reduction of CO2 emissions through the sale of alternative products and services and low-carbon vehicles (batteries, alternative fuels, etc.). (Short-Medium-Long term) Risk in the value chain: reputational damage and loss of financial support due to failure to meet stakeholders' increasing expectations related to climate commitments and transparency of investee companies, also caused by delays in securing carbon removal technologies and new technology for electrification. (Medium-Long term) Opportunity in the value chain: the increasing customer demand and regulatory requirements for energy-efficient vehicles and equipment with a lower environmental impact may lead to expanded market share and revenue growth for investee companies. (Short-Medium-Long term) The DMA identified climate change as the most material topic and as sub-topics climate change mitigation for the downstream value chain (investee companies) and climate change adaptation for both its own operations and the value chain. Given its nature, Exor has carried out a resilience assessment of its strategy and business model in relation to climate change for its downstream value chain activities through its investee companies, who operate across diverse sectors and play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. This exposes Exor to sector-specific risks and opportunities, which it addresses by analysing climate scenarios aligned with a 2°C or lower pathway. These analyses help Exor assess its strategy’s resilience and are considered as part of overall capital allocation decisions. In 2023, Exor identified its climate-related risks and opportunities in line with TCFD recommendations, based on its composition and has quantitatively assessed those that are most relevant. The investee companies in scope were Ferrari, Stellantis, CNH Industrial and Iveco Group, as they account for approximately 99% of the CO2 emissions deriving from the investee companies and considering the nature of their business, they are likely to have a high level of exposure to both transition and physical climate change risks and opportunities in the short, medium and long term. Climate-related scenario analysis Scenario analysis Exor's resilience strategy has been assessed at the investee company level by considering different climate scenarios defined by internationally accredited providers (IEA, IPCC - SSP/RCP), which use advanced statistical modelling in order to give representation of climate state and climate-related policy evolution. 108 BOARD REPORT"
"2.2 Emissions reduction in the value chain Exor encourages its investee companies to set reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and measure Scope 3 emissions by sharing best practices as well as supporting and challenging their respective sustainability strategies via its board representation. Investee companies like Philips and Iveco Group have publicly committed to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) goals, reinforcing their dedication to emissions reduction and net-zero ambitions. Exor also encourages all of its public investee companies to have robust sustainability governance, adhere to international guidelines, and implement risk evaluation systems to address climate risks. Notable efforts include CNH Industrial and Ferrari’s leadership in sustainable practices, Stellantis’ expansion in electric vehicles (EVs), and Iveco Group’s focus on low-carbon solutions.

At the same time, these companies are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change like extreme weather events and hazards. Examples of initiatives carried out by the investee companies can be found below: • Ferrari: Ferrari's Environmental Practice highlights its commitment to minimising its environmental impact. The company focuses on cutting greenhouse gas emissions throughout product life cycles, minimising water use, reusing waste materials, monitoring emissions, and protecting biodiversity in affected areas. Ferrari's decarbonization strategy defined in 2022 is aligned with the trajectory “well below 2°C” in order to contribute to ambitions at the international, national and regional level and entails a reduction of at least 90% of Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method) absolute CO2eq emissions and a reduction of at least 40% of Scope 3 emissions per car, with respect to 2021. In this context, Ferrari's most significant environmental efforts are deployed through a program for the reduction of polluting and GHG emissions, both direct and indirect. • Stellantis: Stellantis has undertaken key actions to address climate change by preventing, mitigating, and remediating its impacts, while also managing climate-related risks and opportunities. These initiatives align with the company's policy objectives and GHG emission reduction targets, as outlined in its Dare Forward strategic plan (reducing absolute GHG emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3 compared to the 2021 base year, lowering GHG emissions intensity per vehicle across these scopes, and reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions). Stellantis focuses on three main decarbonisation levers: a low- carbon product portfolio, a sustainable supply chain, and the efficiency of its own operations. BOARD REPORT 115"

Exor has no risk assessment specifically dedicated to sustainability reporting and instead considers the potential associated risks under its risk of ""non/late compliance with applicable legislation/regulations or changes, Business Ethics and Sustainability requirements"". To support its compliance with the applicable sustainability regulatory requirements, Exor involves an external consultant, who helps to provide additional expertise and objectivity where necessary. In relation to the sustainability reporting process, Exor prepares all its own operations reporting internally. The Chief Financial Officer of Exor oversees and is responsible for the preparation of this data. Value chain reporting is prepared with the support of investee companies who complete a reporting package as requested by Exor.
