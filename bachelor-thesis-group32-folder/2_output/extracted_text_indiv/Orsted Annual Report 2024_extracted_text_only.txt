"Material IRO description How do we manage the IRO? Climate-related physical risks (chronic and acute) Risk (own operations) The chronic physical risks relate to the dependency of renewable energy generation on natural resources, such as wind patterns, and the acute physical risks relate to a potential increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events. We assess the resilience of all new assets towards the occurrence of climate-related hazards. Energy consumption, mainly at our CHP plants Negative impact (own operations) We have identified a negative impact associated with energy consumption at our combined heat and power (CHP) plants, which includes the use of fossil-based fuels. The use of fossil-based fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which negatively affect the environment by contributing to global warming. We target reductions in our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. In 2024, we closed Esbjerg Power Station, our last coal-fired CHP plant, advancing our decarbonisation efforts. Climate change adaption Energy This section outlines our approach to managing climate-­ related impacts, risks, and opportunities, ensuring ­resilience and alignment with global ­sustainability goals. While the transition to a green economy offers significant growth opportunities, it also presents ­challenges, particularly in decarbonising supply chains. We have already made substantial progress, transitioning from a fossil fuel-based utility to a global leader in renewable energy. Our policies, strategic actions, and other initiatives highlight our continued efforts towards a low-carbon economy. For an overview of how we have structured this ­chapter, please see page 61. Our IROs are highlighted in italics. // E1-1 Transition plan Ørsted’s transition plan outlines the company’s overall pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, aligned with the 1.5 °C goal of the Paris Agreement. The plan is substantiated by science-based targets, includes key decarbonisation levers, and identifies strategic actions that have driven the transformation of our business model towards renewable energy and will continue to shape our ongoing transition. The plan supports broader policy priorities, including the European Union’s 2050 climate neutrality goals formalised in the European Green Deal and associated regulations (e.g. the EU taxonomy and the EU Green Bonds Standard). These goals represent both an opportunity and a responsibility to align our business strategy with global decarbonisation efforts, contributing to the renewable energy transition and broader sustainability objectives. First transition wave: Shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy Over the past 15 years, we have undergone a significant transformation, evolving from a fossil fuel-based utility to a global leader in renewable energy deployment. This transformation has been driven by substantial investments in offshore wind, onshore wind, solar PV, and storage assets, achieving material progress in decarbonising energy production. Additionally, our shift to biomass-fuelled combined heat and power (CHP) generation has played a pivotal role during this period. This shift continues to be characterised by the following: · Growth in renewable capacity: In 2024, we continued to expand our renewable energy portfolio, reaching a total of 18.2 GW of installed ­capacity, with a pipeline of 7.6 GW in decided (FID’ed) ­capacity, reinforcing our commitment to advancing the global shift to renew- able energy in line with our long term ambition. · An increase in renewable energy generation and the phase-out of coal: We are on track to meet our 2025 target of a 99 % share of energy genera- tion coming from renewables. Our coal generation ­activities were ceased in 2024. · Capital alignment with climate goals: Since the entry into force of the EU Climate Delegated Act, 99 % of Ørsted’s capital expenditures (CAPEX) have been allocated to activities classified as sustainable. For 2024, these expenditures include DKK 37,867 million for the deployment of offshore and onshore wind capacity, DKK 6,097 million for the deployment of solar PV and energy storage 83 Sustainability statements | Environment ØRSTED ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | ESRS E1"
"technologies, and DKK 2,836 million for hydro- gen, carbon capture and storage, and bioenergy activities. · A measurable performance: We track and disclose progress of our renewable energy portfolio by monitoring progress towards our installed capacity ambition. In addition, we track and disclose pro- gress towards our decarbonisation efforts through a suite of SBTi-validated climate targets, including near-term targets for 2025 and 2030 as well as long term targets for 2040. As part of the SBTi valida- tion process of our interim targets, we updated the baseline year for our scope 1-2 emissions intensity target to 2018, replacing the original targets of reducing the scope 1-2 emissions intensity by 98 % by 2025 and by 99 % by 2030 from a 2006 base- line. From the updated 2018 baseline, we now aim to achieve a 93 % reduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG ­emissions intensity by 2025 and progress towards a 96 % reduction by 2030. Our interim scope 1-3 GHG emissions intensity target outlines a reduction ­trajectory of ~77 % by 2030. These interim targets serve as critical waypoints that chart our overall pathway to achieving net-zero by 2040. · Climate advocacy: As part of our efforts to advance policies and frameworks that accelerate the transi- tion to renewable energy, we actively engage with policy-makers and industry peers. Addressing transition risks from locked-in emissions Locked-in emissions refer to future emissions resulting from existing or planned infrastructure and assets. In our case, such emissions are tied to our gas sales ­activities. This is primarily due to our binding contractual obligations for offtake volumes of natural gas from the gas fields operated by the Danish ­Underground Consortium (DUC). We recognise the importance of tackling the impacts of our legacy business, as locked-in emissions pose a significant transition challenge if left unadressed. To guide progress toward our net-zero goals, we have set an absolute emissions reduction target for scope 3 emissions from gas sales, aiming to reduce emissions by ~67 % by 2030 (baseline 2018) and by ~90 % by 2040. To mitigate potential risks associated with locked-in emissions, we focus on the following: · Measurable performance: We track and disclose progress towards our absolute reduction targets for gas sales. The targets are aligned with the 1.5 °C pathway, and we aim to remain on track to deliver on our net-zero ambition. · Avoiding additional locked-in emissions: We do not enter into new gas sourcing agreements that would contribute to additional locked-in emissions. As a renewable energy company committed to driving the energy transition, we aim to address the challenges posed by our legacy business. These efforts reflect our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 and making a meaningful contribution to the global renewable energy transition. As of 31 December 2024, we are not excluded from the Paris-aligned Benchmark (PAB), providing further evidence for the successful transition away from fossil fuels. Second transition wave: Decarbonising our supply chains Having shown substantial progress in transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy gener- ation, we are now entering the second wave of our transformation: addressing emissions from our value chains. Already today, power from offshore wind farms has 99 % lower GHG emissions than power from coal. However, the large scale of renewable energy projects creates both a need and an opportunity to further decarbonise, particularly by addressing emis- sions, such as steel production, maritime fuels, and manufacturing processes. Achieving our 2040 net-zero target will require close collaboration with suppliers and industry peers. This wave is characterised by the following: · Value chain decarbonisation road map: We con- tinuously revise and improve our company-wide decarbonisation roadmap to stay aligned with the latest developments and support informed decision-making. · Active supplier engagement: We work closely with key suppliers to drive the integration of decarboni- sation into their strategies and operations. · Partnerships: We work to establish strong partner­ ships and collaborate with key suppliers to support the decarbonisation of our value chain. Strategic partnerships, such as our collaboration with ­Dillinger, play a vital role in securing access to lower-emissions steel for critical components like offshore wind monopile foundations. · Tracking and measuring: We continue to improve our in-house life cycle assessment capabilities to ­measure and monitor value chain emissions reductions effec- tively. We maintain detailed emissions reporting both internally and externally, with external reports being subject to limited assurance. Governance and oversight of the transition plan Matters related to the transition plan are addressed within our sustainability governance framework. The elements of our transition plan are fully disclosed in our annual report, which is presented to shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting (AGM), providing them with an opportunity to offer feedback. The way forward Our vision supported by our strategic ambition remains clear: to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. Achieving this ambition requires us to remain attuned to a market environment increasingly shaped by national climate ambitions, regulatory developments, and the need to proactively identify and manage material sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities that influence our long term resilience and competitiveness. As the interlinkages between rising global tempera- tures, biodiversity loss, resource scarcity, and affected communities become more pronounced, they are driving shifts in demand, investment priorities, and expectations for corporate action. Managing these sustainability-related dynamics is essential to main- taining our leadership in the energy transition and securing our organisation’s adaptability in a trans- forming market. 84 Sustainability statements | Environment ØRSTED ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | ESRS E1"
"We continue to leverage advanced technologies and scalable solutions to optimise renewable energy ­integration and supply chain decarbonisation, as outlined in our innovation report. Additionally, as highlighted in our first climate advocacy report, we actively engage in shaping policies to align global energy needs with the 1.5 °C goal set by the Paris Agreement. The ­climate advocacy report includes an assessment of our most important industry associa- tions in terms of their alignment with this goal. Guided by our ‘Just transition policy’, we are commit- ted to inclusivity by safeguarding workers, support- ing communities, and protecting ecosystems as we advance the global energy transformation. By collab- orating closely with local communities, we strive to create opportunities, foster socio-economic growth, and ensure that the renewable energy transition is fair and brings meaningful benefits to all involved. Through innovation, advocacy, and a focus on equity, we aim to lead this transition responsibly. // // ESRS 2, SBM-3; E1, SBM-3 and IRO-1 Resilience analysis Scope of the resilience analysis As a global leader in renewable energy, we employ a comprehensive approach to assessing and man- aging climate-related transition and physical risks, ensuring not only alignment with evolving regulatory requirements but also the resilience of our business model and strategy. Thus, identifying and addressing climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities are at the core of our vision to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. Our approach to resilience analysis consists of two main components: 1. Assessing and managing transition risks and oppor- tunities, which include macroeconomic, political, technological, and market developments associated with the global shift to a low-carbon economy. 2. Conducting physical climate risk assessments to evaluate how climate-related hazards (chronic and acute), including extreme weather events and long- term climate changes, may impact our operations. Transition risks and opportunities Transition risks stem from a shift to a low-carbon economy and encompass factors such as new regu- lations, technological innovation, changing market dynamics, and shifting consumer preferences. Over the past decades, we have effectively mitigated these risks by transforming our business model from fossil fuels to renewable energy, aligning our operations with a 1.5 °C climate trajectory. This proactive shift has positioned us well to capitalise on the increasing demand for renewable energy deployment. Neverthe- less, we recognise that a key challenge to the overall industry is the possibility of insufficient political support for a continued renewable energy build-out, which is critical to the global energy transition. Insufficient political or regulatory support for renewable energy deployment has also been assessed as part of the financial part of our double materiality assessment. Transition risks are particularly relevant to our opera- tions in the US, where changes in investment conditions, reductions in subsidies, or shifting policy priorities could increase uncertainty for future projects. This is why Transition plan highlights Governance · Board level oversight of transition efforts. · Executive incentives linked to climate performance indicators. Financial planning · Capital alignment with climate goals and a 1.5 °C world – 99 % of CAPEX allocated in 2024 is classified as sustainable. Strategy · Renewable energy deployment aligned with global, regional, and national level decarbonisation goals and a 1.5 °C pathway.

"We have not identified any material dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems, although soil stability at our sites constitutes the most significant dependency. Regarding our transitional and physical risks, we have mapped out our exposure and have not found significant risks from biodiversity and ecosystems that are not already covered in our mitigation processes and biodiversity action plans. Additionally, we have not identified any systemic risks to our business model that are not addressed through our established practices or the implementation of measures to reach our biodiversity ambition. A key outcome of our biodiversity programme has been the development of our ‘Biodiversity measurement framework’, which will ensure that we can capture all potential impacts and risks to biodiversity and eco­ systems when developing new renewable energy pro- jects starting from 2024 and thus avoid the majority of impacts and risks to our operations. We have not completed an assessment of how ­systemic risks to society have been considered in the assessment of biodiversity and ecosystems-­related risks yet. However, we have begun the work of under- standing the correlation of these risks, how they impact our projects, and what we can do to mitigate them. The assessment of our upstream value chain that was completed in 2022 using the Global ­Biodiversity Score tool is still relevant today. The results pro- vided an overview of impacts based on our most used ­materials (incl. minerals and metals) and how each material impacts the environment, focusing on biodiversity. The assessment did not include an assessment of how the biodiversity impacts from our upstream value chain affect local communities, but it did provide an essential first step in our work with the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) frame- work and our progress towards being ready to set ­science-based targets for nature. Our continuous work to identify and mitigate ­potential impacts and risks of our assets to biodiversity and ecosystems continues to inform our DMA. In this pro- cess, we base the identification and scoring of IROs on the knowledge gathered across all our offshore and onshore assets, enabling a cross-business assessment of impacts, risks, dependencies, and opportunities. Management of impacts in our own operations At Ørsted, we have sites located in or near biodiversity-­ sensitive areas. However, our activities at these sites only have temporary negative impacts during the ­construction phase, with no material impacts during operations, cf. the outcome of our DMA. By following the steps of our new measurement framework, conducting environmental assessments, implementing appropriate mitigation measures, and applying our ‘Biodiversity policy’, we will be able to avoid any impacts related to the deterioration of biodiversity or natural habitats within our own operations. We adhere to the mitigation hierarchy in the develop- ment of new projects, prioritising to avoid biodiversity impacts wherever feasible. For impacts that ­cannot be entirely avoided, we focus on minimising and ­mitigating them to the extent possible. An example of this is avoiding sensitive habitats during the routing of and installation of cables for offshore projects. Post construction, any residual impacts that could not be fully mitigated are addressed through species-specific or habitat-specific restoration. These efforts aim to restore biodiversity and habitat functioning to at least pre-construction baseline levels and are our measures towards achieving a net-positive impact. This means that the majority of our impacts on bio­ diversity occur during the construction phase, and are appropriately mitigated, while during the operational phase, we have very limited impact on biodiversity that we are not able mitigate. One example of an impact that we are sometimes unable to mitigate during the operational phase of an offshore wind farm, which we have assessed as imma- terial, is the collision of airborne mobile species, such as birds or bats, with wind turbine blades. In cases where this impact cannot be mitigated through loca- tion or design, operational management plans are put in place, for example through enhanced monitor- ing campaigns, often in conjunction with local stake- holder groups. Vulnerable species and critical habitat types are iden- tified during the early screening phase of a project, allowing us to plan our project development around these factors, implementing the mitigation hierarchy and ensuring we are undertaking the actions needed to avoid and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. // // E4, SBM-3 Material impacts and opportunities related to biodiversity and ecosystems Site locations in our own operations We have completed an assessment of all our opera- tional assets in collaboration with The Biodiversity Consultancy, using their Biodiversity Risk Screening Kit (BRiSK). This assessment focused on biodiversity- and ecosystem-related impacts, risks, dependencies, and opportunities at an asset level, helping us to better understand which sites are material in this respect. It takes a variety of factors into account that ­indicate impacts on biodiversity on a scale ranging from low over medium to high. These factors include species, designated areas (including protected areas and key biodiversity areas (KBAs)), ecoregion intactness, water pollution, and marine habitats, amongst others. The assessment highlights a list of matters, indicating that there are potential negative impacts on biodiver- sity if nothing is done to avoid or mitigate these. From that output, we have found that the majority of the identified risks have already been identified through our EIA or equivalent processes as well as mitigated as a part of our biodiversity action plans. Therefore, we are taking all necessary steps to limit risks and negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosys- tems at all our site locations. When we identify over- laps with e.g. an IUCN Red-listed species, an action plan is developed to ensure that we do no significant harm to this species, nor any threatened species, both during construction and the operational phase. 111 Sustainability statements | Environment ØRSTED ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | ESRS E4"
"Site locations without material impacts In total, we have 63 operational sites across our portfolio of renewable energy assets (i.e. offshore and onshore wind, solar PV, and power stations) that currently overlap with or are adjacent to protected areas or KBAs. This is the majority of our assets and is connected to the fact that a buffer zone has been applied (25 km for offshore assets, 10 km for onshore assets), increasing the amount of overlaps with both protected areas and KBAs. Through our mitigation planning and restoration of impacts, we have found that we have no negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems at these sites. Site locations with temporary material impacts In addition to the operational sites, we had 12 assets under construction in 2024, which were identified as material sites that temporarily have activities nega- tively affecting biodiversity-sensitive areas. These sites are listed in the table on page 114 and include nine off- shore wind and three solar PV projects. At the offshore construction sites, biodiversity impacts were primarily associated with monopile piling, which generates noise pollution, and cable laying, which disrupts ­benthic and intertidal habitats. Additionally, the increased vessel traffic during construction caused further disruption to the ecosystem through noise pollution. For the solar PV assets under construction, ­biodiversity impacts were primarily due to land clearing and cable laying, which caused temporary habitat disruption and species displacement. Additionally, the ­operation of machinery contributed to noise pollution. All these impacts are appropriately managed or mitigated through implementation of measures agreed through impact assessment and permitting processes. We have found no negative impacts related to land degradation during the operational phase of our projects, including desertification or soil sealing. Any potential impacts on land degradation are mitigated during the construction phase. Material impacts in our value chain We have identified material negative impacts in our upstream value chain. These impacts are primarily direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss due to extrac- tion of natural resources and mining activities. Further- more, mining also has negative impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems and thus impacts spe- cies diversity. As mentioned previously, we used the Global Biodiversity Score tool to obtain an overview of ­biodiversity- and ecosystems-related impacts in our upstream value chain, using global average data for our industry. We are dependent on mining of metals and minerals to expand the capacity of renewable energy assets, just as our peers in the industry. How- ever, we acknowledge the trade-offs of mining in the value chain, which we actively work towards manag- ing. As mentioned before, we are actively engaging with our tier 1 suppliers on their impacts on biodiver- sity, and we also continuously work towards gathering location-specific data on our upstream value chain. // // E4-2 Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems Policy scope In 2024, we updated our ‘Biodiversity policy’, which applies to all sites owned and operated by Ørsted, including sites in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. The policy addresses the direct impacts from our operations on biodiversity, ecosystem protection, and sustainable ocean practices. The scope of the policy covers all of Ørsted’s renewable energy assets, both offshore and onshore, and includes our initial steps towards addressing biodiversity in our value chain and the associated dependencies. More specifically, we engage with some of our tier 1 suppliers on their progress on working with biodiversity, similar to our approach with decarbonisation. Our biodiversity policy does not currently cover the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from e.g. raw material extraction in our upstream value chain. How- ever, we are committed to working with our suppliers through our ‘Supply chain sustainability programme’ on mitigating their impacts on biodiversity, where we are currently engaging with our tier 1 suppliers. Further tiers down in the value chain, it becomes more challenging to mitigate the inherent impacts on ­biodiversity and, on a broader scale, nature. Through our supplier dialogues and continued work towards a more sustainable supply chain, we aim to implement mitigating actions for biodiversity in our supply chain in the future. The objective of our policy is to outline the importance of biodiversity to Ørsted and how we believe that bio- diversity is a key part of a sustainable project life cycle. The policy also explains the steps we take to protect biodiversity throughout an asset’s life cycle, aiming to avoid potential impacts and risks to biodiversity – from planning and development, through construction, over operation and maintenance, and finally to the decom- missioning and potential repowering phases. Policy governance Accountability of the policy lies with the Chief Commercial Officer (CCO). To ensure that our policy is implemented and taken into account across our business, the policy includes an overview of the governance structure to support its implementation as well as specific third-party standards that support our work, e.g. the EU taxonomy for sustainable economic activities. Interests of key stakeholders Similar to the development of our biodiversity projects (see key actions below), we have also included key stakeholder concerns and interests into the scope of our biodiversity policy. For example, local communities, NGOs, and academia are included in the stakeholder engagement steps during the various phases of an asset’s life cycle. Management and mitigation hierarchy Our business model is to develop, construct, operate, and own renewable assets, and we are committed to doing this in an environmentally and socially sustain- able way. However, we recognise that expanding our operations also implies a greater pressure on ­natural ecosystems. Therefore, protecting and restoring these ecosystems must be part of the solution, and we remain fully committed to effectively manage our impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Biodiversity management is an integral part of our business model and decision-making processes throughout the full life cycle of our projects. This ranges from early-stage site selection and planning, over project design, construction, operations, and eventually to decommissioning. 112 Sustainability statements | Environment ØRSTED ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | ESRS E4"

We temporarily impact protected areas negatively and risk disturbance to habitats and displacement or loss of species. The name of the sites, the size of them, including the buffer zones, and the number of ­protected areas are listed in the table. § Accounting policies During our DMA, we concluded that we have material impacts on biodiversity, which happen during the construction phase of our projects. Therefore, the data presented in this table represents material sites with construction activities in 2024 where overlaps are present. The biodiversity data covers offshore and onshore wind farms and solar farms as well as their cable routes within the buffer zones. For offshore wind farms, a buffer zone of 25 km is applied, whereas the buffer zone is 10 km for onshore wind and solar farms. These buffers have been determined based on best practice rooted in science and to recognise relevant interactions with protected areas for nature conservation or key biodiversity areas. Data is recognised from the date of the final investment decision (FID), and the area in hectare is showed for the asset in its entirety. The data is sourced from the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) using the buffer zones mentioned above for offshore and onshore assets, respectively. The tool provides an output report in which a summarised number of overlaps with protected areas and key biodiversity areas is presented. This number represents any overlaps that should occur within the project site itself and within the buffer zone. // E4, SBM-3; E4-5 114 Sustainability statements | Environment ØRSTED ANNUAL REPORT 2024 | ESRS E4"
"Sustainability governance // ESRS 2, GOV-1 Our sustainability governance enables us to deliver on sustainability matters. In 2024, we redesigned our sustainability governance. The new set-up ensures clear executive accountability for our sustainability matters and stronger ownership of material sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities throughout Ørsted. The new governance was approved by our Group Executive Team in 2024 and will be fully implemented in 2025. Board of Directors Ørsted’s Board of Directors is the highest governing body for sustainability. The Board ultimately approves the strategic direction and targets, oversees our per- formance on material sustainability impacts, risk, opportunities (IROs), and approves the double materi- ality assesssment (DMA) results annually. // // ESRS 2, GOV-1 and GOV-2 The Board is presented with a progress update annually across material IROs and strategic priorities and targets, and engages in deep dives on sustainability topics, when needed. // // ESRS 2, GOV-1 As a whole, the Board possesses expertise across our material sustainability IROs. Based on the seven ESRS topics that have been assessed as material to Ørsted through our DMA, we have mapped the Board’s sustainability competences to ensure that they have the relevant expertise to oversee material sustainability matters. For more details, see pages 46-48 in the ­management’s review. Audit & Risk Committee The Audit & Risk Committee reports to the Board of Directors. The committee is responsible for the integrity and statutory compliance of Ørsted’s CSRD reporting. The Audit & Risk Committee meets six times a year and annually reviews our CSRD reporting, including the DMA results, before the Board of Directors approves it.

"// ESRS 2, GOV-1 and GOV-2 The Group Executive Team discusses material sustain- ability IROs twice a year. They approve our strategic direction and targets on sustainability, including links to our corporate strategy, and are accountable for our performance ambitions on sustainability topics. The Group Executive Team discusses and reviews the DMA ahead of the Board of Directors’ approval as well as performance on material sustainability matters and progress towards targets. The Group Executive Team has always considered material sustainability matters when ­overseeing our corporate strategy, and going forward, the IROs resulting from our DMA will further inform their decision-­making and support that the IROs are con- sistently considered in decisions, ranging from what we source to how we develop, construct, operate, and decommission our projects. The material IROs addressed during the year are described in the topical ESRS chapters under the actions section. // // ESRS 2, GOV-1 As a whole, the Group Executive Team possesses expertise across our material IROs. For more details, see page 52 in the management’s review. Group Executive Team accountable persons In 2024, we strengthened the Group Executive Team’s accountability for sustainability and delegated accountability of material sustainability areas to individual members of the Group Executive Team in alignment with the sustainability topics defined in the ESRS standards. The new governance integrates responsibility into the line organisation in Ørsted to ensure a focused set-up with a strong mandate to execute on sustainability topics. The new accountable persons in the Group Executive Team are individually accountable for driving progress on the assigned sustainability topic according to road- maps, including defining key actions and allocating resources to secure progress on targets and ambitions. They will be supported by supportive decision forums as well as internal experts from the support functions on sustainability topics. Supportive decision forums The Decarbonisation Core Group and the ­Biodiversity & Community Impact Core Group will support the accountable persons in the Group Executive Team in delivering on our strategic sustainability priority areas. The two new groups will kick off in 2025 and consist of the Group Executive Team accountable person and senior leaders from functional areas with a clear role in delivering on the material sustainability matters. The groups have a tactical responsibility and decide on new sustainability initiatives needed to deliver on our ambitions and targets, guide implementation in the organisation, and act on IROs. The core groups will meet two-three times a year or pending need. We are in the process of establishing a human rights task force, specifically focused on strengthening our due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the upcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). The task force will enable the implementation of a human rights management ­system and oversee its integration into relevant business processes to reach compliance. The task force will kick off in 2025 and consist of the Group Executive Team accountable person as well as senior leaders representing Ørsted’s value chain to ensure the value chain-wide approach of integrating human rights into management systems and processes. The task force will meet twice a year. The Compliance Committee monitors compliance with laws, rules, standards, and internal codes of conduct for all business areas. The QHSE Committee oversees our quality, health, safety, and environment (QHSE) priorities and has a special focus on these aspects in relation to sustainability topics. Business functions The business functions are responsible for executing on material sustainability IROs. They deliver concrete actions on the ground to progress on our targets and ambitions while managing risks and capturing performance data. Support functions The key support functions are Corporate Strategy, Global Sustainability, and Group Finance. The support functions assist all the accountable persons in ­facilitating the sustainability work and oversight and guides and enables the accountable persons in the Group Executive Team and the business in setting ambition levels and delivering on sustainability matters. // // ESRS 2, GOV-5 Risk management and internal controls In preparation for the CSRD, a plan was estab- lished to perform walkthroughs to identify risks, reassess existing controls, and identify additional controls for sustainability reporting. This initiative started in 2024 and will continue until the end of 2025. These walkthroughs of sustainability reporting processes were priori- tised based on the results of the DMA performed in 2023 with reference to the draft ESRS. Priority is given to the quantitative data points related to our material ESRS topics. The walkthroughs are facilitated by the Internal Control Assurance team (second line of defence) in collaboration with functions involved in the sustainability reporting processes and data collection processes. The risks associated with the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the data as well as results of estimations and calculations are assessed based on materiality of the individual data points and process complexity. The walkthrough of the ESRS ‘E1 Climate change’ topic was finalised in 2024. It was con- firmed that main risks in data collection and reporting processes for material data points within this area have been mitigated by rele- vant controls. Some controls required formal- isation, which has been completed in 2024. Since January 2025, formalised controls for this area have been included in our ‘Internal con- trol framework’ for financial and sustainability reporting processes to further monitor their design and operating effectiveness. The Audit & Risk Committee monitors our ­sustainability reporting processes, including the plans for improvements, risks, internal controls, and their operating effectiveness. // 64 Sustainability statements | General ØRSTED ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
