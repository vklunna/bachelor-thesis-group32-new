however ghg emission reduction target linked action
active management climate action action comprised set subactions 1
monitor work portfolio level including absolute relative emission levels
order achieve impact aim right data additional information needed measuring steering work will key
2
continue improve data quality collection including level customers
data collection markets specific customer types always readily available especially investments smaller companies financial institutions funds need obtain data clients
tackle challenge together development finance institution partners launched joint impact model jim 2021
jim allows us model emissions absence emission data indication portfolio emissions
3
adopt adaptive management approach adjust actions based data information
intent datainformation collection drive use information gather report compliance purposes also better actively manage portfolio tailor climate actions effective
moving forward will continue work improving systems

active management climate action action comprised set subactions 1
monitor work portfolio level including absolute relative emission levels
order achieve impact aim right data additional information needed measuring steering work will key
2
continue improve data quality collection including level customers
data collection markets specific customer types always readily available especially investments smaller companies financial institutions funds need obtain data clients
tackle challenge together development finance institution partners launched joint impact model jim 2021
jim allows us model emissions absence emission data indication portfolio emissions
3
adopt adaptive management approach adjust actions based data information
intent datainformation collection drive use information gather report compliance purposes also better actively manage portfolio tailor climate actions effective
moving forward will continue work improving systems

targets alignment paris agreement objectives brd group established two key targets address environmental impact 1 achieving eur 24 billion sustainable finance production 2027 2 achieving 55 reduction carbon footprint operations 2027 compared 2019 baseline
however important note targets sciencebased explicitly aligned limiting global warming 15c
methodology used determine targets primarily based internal assessments industry benchmarks alignment sg group ambitions rather sectoral decarbonization pathway
brd groups carbon reduction target operational emissions derived analysis historical emissions operational energy efficiency initiatives anticipated improvements energy procurement building infrastructure
