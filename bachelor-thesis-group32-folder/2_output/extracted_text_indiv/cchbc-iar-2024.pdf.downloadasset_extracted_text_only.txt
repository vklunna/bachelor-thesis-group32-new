"In 2024, we identified four confirmed cases of corruption involving employees. All were thoroughly investigated in accordance with internal guidelines, resulting in appropriate actions, including the dismissal of four individuals – one of whom had already left the company before the violation was discovered. Of the four incidents, three resulted in employee dismissal or disciplinary action, while one involved a supplier, leading to the non-renewal of their business contract. No public legal cases were brought against Coca-Cola HBC during the reporting period. Fair competition We are committed to promoting awareness and ensuring full compliance with applicable competition laws and regulations across all our operations. Mandatory annual trainings on competition law for employees, including senior management, are implemented across all countries. In 2024, there were no decisions with findings of anti-competitive behaviour on the part of our company. Taxation We are committed to complying with both the spirit and letter of all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in every jurisdiction where we operate. Our Tax Policy outlines governance procedures and risk management best practices to ensure robust tax compliance and reporting across the Group. We publish a Tax Transparency Report that reflects our commitment to openness and accountability. Additionally, we closely monitor developments in the fast-evolving tax reporting landscape to prepare for upcoming regulatory changes. In this regard, we collaborate with trusted tax advisers and statutory auditors to ensure our approach remains compliant and aligned with best practices. Explanation of key performance indicators In accordance with Annex I to the Delegated Act under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the following KPIs are used to determine the proportion of eligible and aligned activities. By relying on our detailed financial statements, clearly distinguishing activity definitions and allocating appropriately expenses, we ensure that double counting is avoided. Turnover Turnover corresponds to the net sales figure presented in the consolidated income statement under IFRS 15, as detailed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. No eligible or aligned turnover is recognised, as the ‘Food and beverage manufacturing’ economic activity is not in scope of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. Capital expenditure (Capex) Taxonomy-relevant Capex is determined as follows: • Capex denominator: This includes the total additions of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets as well as the addition of right- of-use assets for leases recognised under IFRS 16. These relate to Notes 13, 14 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements. In 2024, the Capex additions amounted to €795.2 million. • Capex numerator: For eligibility, capital expenditure has been allocated to assets associated with the Taxonomy-eligible activities listed above. For alignment, the eligible assets have been thoroughly assessed against the respective TSC and DNSH criteria. As a result, we identified €5.3 million in EU Taxonomy- aligned investments linked to activities CE1.1, CCM4.25, CCM5.1, CCM5.2 and CCM7.4. Operating expenditure (Opex) • Opex denominator: This refers to direct non-capitalised costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair and other direct expenses necessary for the continued and effective functioning of property, plant and equipment. The cost of goods sold is excluded from the definition, meaning the installation of solar panels through Power Purchase Agreements and the cost of sustainable packaging materials, such as rPET, are considered out of scope. For Coca-Cola HBC, we considered expenditures related to repair & maintenance, day-to-day servicing of assets and short-term leases. • Opex numerator: This captures Opex associated with activities deemed eligible and aligned. In 2024, while activities CE1.1, CCM6.5 and CCM7.7 were all identified as having eligible Opex, only activity CE1.1 contributed to the €1.0 million of aligned Opex. Our operations do not include activities related to natural gas or nuclear energy, as per the following table: Nuclear energy related activities 1. CCHBC carries out, funds or has exposures to research, development, demonstration and deployment of innovative electricity generation facilities that produce energy from nuclear processes with minimal waste from the fuel cycle. No 2. CCHBC carries out, funds or has exposures to construction and safe operation of new nuclear installations to produce electricity or process heat, including for the purposes of district heating or industrial processes such as hydrogen production, as well as their safety upgrades, using best available technologies. No 3. CCHBC carries out, funds or has exposures to safe operation of existing nuclear installations that produce electricity or process heat, including for the purposes of district heating or industrial processes such as hydrogen production from nuclear energy, as well as their safety upgrades. No Fossil gas related activities 4. CCHBC carries out, funds or has exposures to construction or operation of electricity generation facilities that produce electricity using fossil gaseous fuels. No 5. CCHBC carries out, funds or has exposures to construction, refurbishment, and operation of combined heat/cool and power generation facilities using fossil gaseous fuels. No 6. CCHBC carries out, funds or has exposures to construction, refurbishment and operation of heat generation facilities that produce heat/ cool using fossil gaseous fuels1. No 1. With most CHP facilities operated by third parties, the most relevant expenditures fall under Opex, specifically utilities, which represent insignificant amounts. Moreover, utilities are not recognized as part of the EU Taxonomy denominator.

"Sustainability Statement continued E3.MDR-T_10, 11 & E3-3_01 We set measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets for water stewardship, grounded in the TNFD framework and aligned with the UN SDGs. All of the targets are voluntary. We follow a three-step process to ensure our targets are scientifically sound and relevant. These targets are developed through a structured, inclusive and scientifically sound process. The approach begins with identifying key areas where our operations depend on or impact water resources, with a focus on high-risk geographies identified through comprehensive risk assessments. These water-risk, or water- priority locations face specific challenges such as water scarcity, limited access to water and sanitation services for local communities, and declining water quality within watersheds. Evidence-based evaluations of water-related risks and opportunities guide our actions to ensure they are beneficial to local ecosystems. Lastly, we have initiated our engagement with the SBTN. Notably, SBTN has recently updated its methodology, and as a result, we plan to establish our freshwater targets in alignment with their framework in the next years. Stakeholder engagement is pivotal to this process, particularly through Annual Stakeholder Forums and frequent meetings with local communities, farmers, municipalities, NGOs and primary sugar and sweetener suppliers to address critical environmental topics, including water footprint, water usage, emissions reduction and deforestation. The insights gathered from these engagements, along with the expectations of ESG raters and investors, inform the formulation of ambitious, data-driven targets, such as reducing water usage and replenishing water resources in high-risk locations. Additionally, the Group prioritises initiatives such as water-replenishment activities, nature-based solutions, wetland restorations, and improvements to water quality in these regions. Collaborating closely with stakeholders and local communities, we strive to ensure access to safe, clean water, while addressing water-related challenges through sustainable water management across our operations.

Primary data on water extraction, categorised by source, is collected on a monthly basis. Progress towards water usage targets is monitored regularly using specialised software, ensuring accurate and timely tracking of performance. Monthly reviews with the management at local plant, country and Group level are performed to monitor performance and actions. Following the ESRS definition on water risk, we have 29 plants located in areas with certain water risk (lack of clean water and sanitation (WASH) for communities, water quality, reputational risk, high-water stress). Out of them, 20 plants are situated in watersheds with high-water stress as per the latest version of the WRI Aqueduct tool. For example, one of those watersheds is the Asopos River basin in Greece where we implement water replenishment activities in collaboration with the local municipality and NGOs. As per our internal evaluation, considering the local site-specific context, done for our Mission 2025 commitments, 19 of our plants are designated as priority plants, located in areas facing challenges related to basin water quantity, water quality or WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) for communities.

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystem SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model E4.SBM-3_05 Through our double materiality assessment, we have identified a material impact within our upstream value chain specifically related to land use change. However, no material impact has been identified in relation to soil degradation, desertification, or soil sealing. E4-1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model E4-1_01 Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems is one of our main sustainability priorities. Our biggest impact on the biodiversity landscape occurs in the upstream segment of our value chain, and it is related to the potential deforestation (land use change) from some agricultural commodities, mostly wood (used for our paper packaging materials). We are committed to eliminate deforestation of our main ingredients by 2025, and it is aligned with the recommendations by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for companies with Forest, Land and Agricultural Activities (FLAG). Due to FLAG recommendations we have updated our net zero plan as stated in ESRS E1. Also, in our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), we have requirements related to deforestation, and our target is to achieve 100% sustainable sourcing by 2025. We voluntarily report the sites which are adjacent to legally protected areas, and for all of them we have a confirmed ‘no negative impact’ by an external expert which performs so-called Source Vulnerability Assessment for all the water sources we use in direct operations. In 2022, we published our biodiversity statement where we set a goal to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in our operations and supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. The time horizons we use are defined as follows: short-term (2024), medium-term (2025-2030), and long-term (2031-2050). E4-1_02 Environmental risks at supplier level, including deforestation risk, are mitigated through our robust programme at procurement level. We annually review the risks and performance of all our suppliers against our SGPs, PSA principles for agricultural ingredients, Water Risk Assessment, as well as other equally important aspects that impact our business, such as supply risk and financial stability. Overall, it is important to point out that sustainability is one of the key criteria in supplier selection under strategic sourcing, as well as a criterion for the Annual Supplier Review process that we conduct cross-functionally across our supply base. In more detail, to ensure that suppliers demonstrate ESG requirements’ compliance we rely on multiple screening and assessment practices that offer us a holistic view of their performance. This means we collect primary and secondary data that we combine together and analyse to identify priority areas for critical to our operations suppliers. The Sustainable Agriculture programme secures ESG monitoring through PSA certification process of the Coca-Cola System across our main agricultural commodities. For the remaining supply base, we have designed a robust assessment journey leveraging ESG physical audits, as well as a number of globally recognised screening and assessment tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus, EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX, WWF Water Risk Filter Assessment, Resilience Event Watch, Exiger and Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, annual Supply Base Assessments are carried out by specialist consultants for Group Critical suppliers. These assessments evaluate Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers on various criteria, including water risk, climate change, forced labour, child labour, labour rights, biodiversity, and financial risk. In case of any risk identified, the supplier is asked to provide an action plan which is monitored regularly. For deforestation, we have a specific project in place where we perform readiness assessment for all our supplier under the requirements of EUDR and we are currently organising our internal process to ensure we are able to assess risks and take necessary actions on an on-going basis from the moment that EUDR is formally introduced as of 1st of January 2026.

"Sustainability Statement continued commodities, we are proactively collecting deforestation information from all agricultural ingredients suppliers across all our countries in order to have a holistic view of the exposure and potential risk. By the end of 2025, we will have a programme in place to cover any identified gaps. Last but not least, we are in process of implementing a deforestation tracking platform on top of any other activities already in motion, which will also be ready before the end of 2025. E4-1_03, 04, 05 The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has identified five pressures on nature: 1) land/water/sea use change, 2) resource exploitation, 3) climate change, 4) pollution and 5) invasive species. In 2023, we undertook the mapping and materiality assessment on biodiversity across our value chain and we assessed those pressures following the SBTN guideline step 1 and 2. We have collected all our activity data, covering: 1) upstream activities (volumes sourced and origin of raw materials), 2) direct operations (consumption of water and energy of all sites), and 3) downstream (packaging distribution by country). Then we translated the activity data into pressures on nature across five metrics. These pressures on nature were weighted by local nature vulnerability indicators assessing the state of nature in the locations where the activity occurs. Time horizons used in the analysis are as described in E4-1_01. We considered in the assumptions the tighter environmental regulations (e.g., EUDR), carbon pricing policies which would include land conversion activities, deforestation-free commitments from suppliers, and climate risks (e.g., water scarcity, extreme weather events). The result shows that the biggest impact we have is in upstream activities, mainly agricultural suppliers and their impact on land-use change or deforestation. Our procurement strategy to purchase certified raw materials that meet our PSA and our goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chain, support mitigation of the impact and also reduce any potential risk that may occur. E4-1_06 Relevance to stakeholder engagement is described in E4.MDR-T_11. E4-2 Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems E4.MDR-P_01 & E4-2_01, 20 We have adopted policies that address deforestation and sustainable land practices. Our overarching goal for biodiversity is to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Besides, we have set our Environmental Policy, the main objective of which is to minimise the environmental impact of the Group, and the Biodiversity Statement, the objective of which is to enhance biodiversity by reducing emissions and water use, by preserving and reinstating water priority areas, and by sourcing agricultural ingredients sustainably. Moreover, through the Biodiversity Statement, CCHBC is committed to promoting sustainable forest management and helping protect woodlands from deforestation and illegal harvesting. For the monitoring process, please refer to ESRS E1 section, as it constitutes the standard procedure applicable to all relevant topics. Our policies support biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, and responsible sourcing. We are committed to achieving a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas by 2040 and eliminating deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Thus, our policies address ecosystem protection, sustainable forest management, and mitigation of environmental impacts. We recognise the importance of biodiversity for long-term resilience, as our Natural Capital Impact Study and Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVA) help identify key dependencies and risks, while sustainable sourcing practices mitigate transition risks. We implement traceability mechanisms through certifications, verification schemes, and supplier requirements aligned with The Coca-Cola Company’s Principles for Sustainable Agriculture and EcoVadis assessments. Moreover, our policies prioritise collaboration with NGOs, communities, and industry stakeholders to ensure sustainable supply chains that respect human rights, promote responsible land use, and protect natural ecosystems. E4.MDR-P_02 The policies are applicable across all geographies where Coca-Cola HBC operates. Among the affected stakeholder groups, farmers, other suppliers and local communities associated with the Group’s upstream value chain, are most significantly impacted. E4.MDR-P_03 Policies/statements related to environment (including biodiversity) are approved and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors, and they apply to all Coca-Cola HBC employees, regardless of level and function. E4.MDR-P_04 & E4-2_02 In June 2022, we joined the SBTN Corporate Engagement Program. We will continue working to implement the SBTN’s guidance, in order to map and assess the material impacts on biodiversity of our critical commodities and suppliers and then set science-based targets in priority areas. E4.MDR-P_05 We engage with a broad range of stakeholder groups for biodiversity, including our communities, governments, NGOs, investors and suppliers, taking into account their recommendations in the process of setting biodiversity-related policy. For more information, please refer to E1 section. E4.MDR-P_06 The Environmental Policy and the Biodiversity Statement are publicly available at our site (Policies | Coca-Cola HBC), which affected stakeholders can easily access. E4-2_03 The critical areas in our supply chain are defined based on the material dependencies that we have in relation to biodiversity, for example the provision of water, agricultural raw materials and wood. E4-2_04 We started mapping all our operations and critical commodities/suppliers. For our sustainability assessment, we use the risk-based approach with the support of our partners (EcoVadis). Transparency and traceability of material supply chains is established through certifications/ verification schemes or by ensuring suppliers have robust traceability of supply that meets our expectations (please see ‘Supplier Engagement, Verification and Assurance’ from TCCC Principles for Sustainable Agriculture). Also, we regularly measure and report on the progress made against our Mission 2025 commitments, and all other commitments, including those related to biodiversity and deforestation. The annual performance is disclosed in our Annual Report and the GRI Content Index, verified by an independent auditor, and published on our website. E4-2_05, 06, 07, 18 We are committed to sourcing 100% of our key ingredients in line with the Principles for Sustainable Agriculture as set out by TCCC. These principles protect and support biodiversity and ecosystems, uphold human and workplace rights, ensure animal health and welfare, and help build thriving communities. They apply to primary production, i.e., at farm level, and form the basis for our continued engagement with Tier 1 suppliers to ensure sustainable long-term supply at a lower environmental impact. This extends in particular to the sections Conservation of Forests, Conservation of Natural Habitats, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Soil Management and Agrochemical Management.

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E1 – Climate change Strategy E1-1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation E1-1_01,02,03,05,06,12,13,14,15, E1.MDR-A_06,07,09,10,11,12 & E1-3_05,06, E1-4_23 Our focus on clear targets and robust action plans around climate change is evident in our climate transition plan. We have committed to our NetZeroby40 journey since 2021, and the healthy liquidity position of the Group ensures proper funding of relevant initiatives every year. Our climate transition plan, first developed in 2021, covers the full value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) and it is as per the 1.5 degree scenario, approved by the SBTi. Developed by a cross-functional team of experts, the plan was approved by the ELT (through Sustainability SteerCo) and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the BoD. Coca-Cola HBC considers five main levers and those are the main actions for each lever: 1. Manufacturing (includes scope 1 fuels used, scope 1 losses of CO2 used for beverage carbonation, scope 2 electricity/heat/steam/ hot water purchased) • Continue implementing and accelerating the energy-efficient projects in our plants (deployment of energy saving projects, old equipment modernization, and installation of heat pumps & electrification). • Improving the CO2 yield in the plants. • Accelerating usage of renewable and/ or cleaner energy to replace fossil fuel in scope 1 or electricity/heat/steam/ hot water in scope 2. 2. Transportation (includes scope 1 fuels used for own transport, both light and heavy, and scope 3 fuels used for outsourced logistics and transportation) • Optimising the routes of light and heavy fleet, increasing logistics efficiency and increasing heavy trucks utilization. • Shifting the existing fleet to innovative technologies and renewable or alternative fuels. • Enhancing the strategic partnerships with our third-party logistics providers and joint investments (accelerate shifting to alternative fuels, route to market evolution, shifting of more volume to trains and applying industry innovations). 3. Packaging (includes scope 3 from all primary, secondary and tertiary packaging used for our products) • Implementing our Packaging Mix of the Future strategy (increasing recycled PET, moving from non-reusable one-way glass bottles to reusable glass bottles and providing more packageless solutions). • Implementing decarbonisation of our primary and secondary packaging materials (aluminium cans, PET bottles, glass bottles, plastic labels, closures, stretch films etc.). 4. Ingredients (includes scope 3 from all ingredients used for manufacturing of our beverages) • Decarbonisation initiatives with our suppliers (engagement of farmers through co- development of farming pilots with suppliers, using regenerative agricultural practices). • Continue reformulation of our products and moving to more lights and zero products in our beverage portfolio. 5. Drink Equipment (includes scope 3 of electricity used by our customers for the drink equipment we provide, scope 1 for refrigerant losses from cold drink equipment) • Accelerate the process of providing energy efficient drink equipment to our customers and finding innovative solutions for further energy efficiency of our drink equipment. • Greening the electricity grid mainly in Europe and with slower pace in Africa.

"Sustainability Statement continued For more details on emissions reduction per lever, please see Table 9: Mitigation actions per decarbonisation lever. Coca-Cola HBC is not excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. NetZeroby40 roadmap is presented in the Strategic Report, section ‘Earn our Licence to operate’ on page 25. In 2024, we invested €200 million of capital expenditure (Capex) on projects supporting the implementation of our climate transition plan, representing 29.4% of total Capex. We also invested €30 million driven by the higher cost of recycled PET compared to virgin PET, as we pursue our strategic objective to reach 35% rPET by 2025, positively influencing both the reduction of our scope 3 emissions and the transition to a circular economy. Our accounting system does not separately classify sustainability-related investments or costs, as both are reported in accordance with the general financial reporting principles. For Capex, however, we apply an internal process to identify expenditures fully aligned with the levers of the transition plan. This allows us to track and monitor investments that directly support our commitment to emissions’ reduction but does not necessarily consider larger investments that have multiple objectives, even when sustainability is one of them. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our financial statements, as part of the overall amounts reported in the cash flow statement and the income statement, reinforcing our climate change mitigation actions. In 2025, we plan to follow a similar approach, investing 30% of total Capex on projects supporting the implementation of our climate transition plan. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared to virgin PET will increase further in 2025 to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. In the medium term, for the period 2026-2030, Capex investments that support our transition plan will gradually increase to reach 37% of Capex in 2030. Main drivers are the acceleration of investments to improve energy efficiency of our manufacturing plants and using more renewable fuel alternatives, the switch to coolers with even better energy profile and the increase in the contribution of returnable glass bottles to our package portfolio. As far as investments in Opex/ Cogs are concerned, we expect that they will also gradually increase, as we will use more packaging materials with recycled content and purchase more ingredients that are sustainably sourced. For the period after 2030, we expect to continue on the 2025-2030 trajectory of investments, both Capex and Opex/Cogs to support the faster reduction of emissions so that we can meet our NetZeroby40 commitment. Given the fast-paced nature of our business, being a consumer goods company, the rapid technological advancements, and the uncertainty in the regulatory environment, an attempt to assign investment amounts per decarbonisation action could result in misleading information. Hence, we maintain the approach we have followed in the past few years and report the percentage of total Capex that is related to projects that support the implementation of our transition plan. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals and EU Environmental Objectives. Financing mechanisms include a diverse range of instruments, ensuring flexibility in meeting both current and future financial requirements for action plans. The Group’s €500 million green bond, issued in September 2022 under the Green Finance Framework, was fully allocated to eligible projects by September 2023, as detailed in our Green Finance Report. Our sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of €800 million remains available until April 2026, although not specifically earmarked for funding the transition plan. These initiatives complement the Group’s broader access to diversified financial resources. Further details on financial instruments and resource allocation are available in Note 25, p.306. E1-1_07 By 2030, the only assets from scope 1 and 2 in manufacturing that could potentially lead to significant locked-in GHG emissions are the CHP plants outside Europe and boilers used in manufacturing facilities, as they will still operate with fossil fuels (natural gas mainly), and it will be difficult to switch to alternative or renewable fuels. We will run an innovation project in two of the manufacturing sites to use biomass for the boilers and based on the results we are planning to implement across all plants by 2040. In logistics, we will have around 2,000 own trucks (scope 1) by 2030 using fossil fuel. In light fleet, which is leased and changed every four years, we don’t expect significant locked-in emissions. As per our NetZeroby40 commitment, by 2050 we will not have main assets with significant locked-in emissions: CHP in operations will be either decommissioned or replaced by renewable fuel, and boilers’ fuel will be replaced by alternative systems. By 2050, we don’t expect any of our own trucks to run on fossil fuel. Cumulatively, by 2030 those locked-in emissions would be around 256,000 tonnes of CO2e or 6.9% of our scope 1, 2, 3 emissions. Those locked-in emissions are not likely to affect our NetZeroby40 commitment, as they will be effectively managed and minimised before 2040 as shared above. As we sell beverages, we don’t expect significant locked-in emissions in scope 3 category ‘Use of sold products’, neither by 2030 nor by 2040 or 2050. ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model E1.SBM-3_01,05 Climate change – caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emitted from every business and activity – is leading to global temperature increase and extreme weather conditions around the world. Global warming impacts environment and society across our entire value chain: from suppliers, to customers and consumers. Managing our carbon footprint is our major transition risk related to climate change in the mid and long term, as emerged from the 2024 Double Materiality Assessment. The time horizons applied in the analysis and their business scenarios alignment are: • Short-term horizon: 2025 Annual business planning cycle which includes consideration of short-term risks and opportunities that affect annual performance objectives. • Medium-term horizon: 2030 Long-range planning that includes consideration of risks and opportunities that may affect medium-term objectives, financial viability assurance and allocation of capital for medium-term investments. • Long-term horizon: >2030 Long-term strategic planning including capital investments, mergers and acquisitions, impact of climate change, including meeting our NetZeroby40 commitments. Further details on the DMA process can be found in the ‘Materiality’ section of the IAR on pages 37 to 40 and on page 59 of this document.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1.SBM-3_02 We have a thoroughly designed Business Resilience programme that enables us to proactively manage risks – and embrace opportunities – so that we grow sustainably and meet our short-, medium- and long-term objectives. One of the most significant risks to our resilience over the longer term is climate change. By proactively preparing for and managing climate risk through our business strategy and capital investments, however, we can harness significant opportunities. E1.SBM-3_03,04 In our resilience analysis conducted in 2024, we used a variety of climate scenarios in our assessment of the potential impact of climate change on our business, including: RCP1.9, in order to be consistent with our Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) commitment and as representation of a best-case scenario from a climate action point of view; RCP4.5, as it represents the stated policy position and provides a midpoint scenario, and; RCP8.5, as the ‘worst- case’ or ‘extreme’ scenario, particularly for physical risks. This enabled us to consider a broad range of drivers and their impact. In considering the cost of carbon emissions, the more ambitious scenarios assume a greater amount of government use of regulation, taxes and levies and hence the higher costs of carbon. However, we also assumed that government intervention would not be consistent across all our markets given our diverse operating territories, and therefore countries were grouped into leaders, followers and laggards in evaluating potential increases in taxes and levies. As around 90% of our carbon emissions are scope 3, we are dependent on suppliers and customers reducing their carbon emissions. In estimating the reduction in overall carbon emissions and our ability to meet our NetZeroby40 targets, we used NGFS data to estimate industry decarbonisation rates which are assumptions built into our internal plans for meeting our NetZeroby40 target. Included in our assessment of the impact of climate change on our production and distribution, we used external data used by the insurance industry which we consider to be robust. However, we note that climate-related data can project general changes under different climate scenarios, but cannot predict the timing and severity of extreme events, which our facilities are most at risk from. We used assumptions on projected increases in insurance premiums from statements made by the insurance industry on the impact of climate change, however, we note that the impact that those projections are based on may not apply to us as they do not take into account the actions we are taking to adapt to and mitigate the impact of environmental changes. We used a number of internal assumptions about production volume increases to 2040 in order to estimate carbon emissions and resource usage, but we recognise that a considerable number of variables, such as domestic growth rates in each of our operating countries, changes in consumer demand and preferences, weather, industry actions and competition and government regulations, may affect those estimates. E1.SBM-3_06 As a result of our resilience analysis, we continued to improve our assessment of the effects of climate change, with a focus on clear targets and robust action plans. This enables us to deliver on our commitments, mitigate risks and take advantage of the opportunities inherent in change. E1.SBM-3_07 We are keenly aware of the importance of delivering on our plans and the potential to adjust our strategy to respond to emerging needs and priorities. We continue to decarbonise our value chain, while updating our net zero transition plan and developing long-term climate scenarios. We are also working towards our bold commitment to achieving a net-positive impact on biodiversity by 2040 in critical areas of our value chain, implementing the guidelines of the Science Based Targets Network, and we shifted our deforestation-free commitment from 2030 to 2025. We continue to expand our partnerships and seek new collaborations, as our ambitious goals and commitments can only be achieved through collective action. With prudent financial risk management, the Group maintains a healthy liquidity position and access to various funding sources. As of 31 December 2024, the Group had €1.6 billion available under €5.0 billion Euro medium term note programme, €0.8 billion available under €1.0 billion Euro-commercial paper programme, undrawn revolving credit facility of €0.8 billion and several bilateral bank loan facilities. None of the Group’s debt facilities are subject to financial covenants that could impact liquidity or access to capital. For further details, refer to Note 25, p.306. Strong treasury governance ensures a consistent supply of committed funding at both central and operational levels, optimising liquidity and funding risk management to secure the most efficient financing solutions. This diversified funding strategy supports both operational and strategic needs, enabling the Group to allocate resources effectively to the net zero transition plan as necessary. Impact, risk and opportunity management E1-2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation E1.MDR-P_01, E1-2_01 Our NetZeroby40 commitment is fully aligned with our philosophy to support the socio- economic development of our communities and to make a more positive environmental impact. In accordance with the Climate Change Policy and our overall Environmental Policy, we will: • strive to reduce all our emissions across the value chain as much as possible by: • advancing the reduction of the energy used in our operations; • expanding our use of renewable energy technologies; • deploying more energy-efficient coolers in the marketplace; • accelerating our sustainable packaging agenda and our green fleet; • engaging with relevant stakeholders to combat climate change; • working with suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint and to minimise their climate impacts; and • setting roadmaps for emissions reduction for all our operations and the main steps in the value chain. • keep CO2 emission reduction targets as one of the elements of our long-term management incentive plans; • work with other partners (industries, academia, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governments, etc.) on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation; • consider all climate risks and opportunities and integrate them in our business strategy; • investigate the opportunities for finding solutions for our residual emissions, such as biological and/or technological removals; • monitor, report and audit our GHG emissions, targets, results and activities, and publish transparently our progress in our public files.

"Sustainability Statement continued E3.MDR-T_10, 11 & E3-3_01 We set measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets for water stewardship, grounded in the TNFD framework and aligned with the UN SDGs. All of the targets are voluntary. We follow a three-step process to ensure our targets are scientifically sound and relevant. These targets are developed through a structured, inclusive and scientifically sound process. The approach begins with identifying key areas where our operations depend on or impact water resources, with a focus on high-risk geographies identified through comprehensive risk assessments. These water-risk, or water- priority locations face specific challenges such as water scarcity, limited access to water and sanitation services for local communities, and declining water quality within watersheds. Evidence-based evaluations of water-related risks and opportunities guide our actions to ensure they are beneficial to local ecosystems. Lastly, we have initiated our engagement with the SBTN. Notably, SBTN has recently updated its methodology, and as a result, we plan to establish our freshwater targets in alignment with their framework in the next years. Stakeholder engagement is pivotal to this process, particularly through Annual Stakeholder Forums and frequent meetings with local communities, farmers, municipalities, NGOs and primary sugar and sweetener suppliers to address critical environmental topics, including water footprint, water usage, emissions reduction and deforestation. The insights gathered from these engagements, along with the expectations of ESG raters and investors, inform the formulation of ambitious, data-driven targets, such as reducing water usage and replenishing water resources in high-risk locations. Additionally, the Group prioritises initiatives such as water-replenishment activities, nature-based solutions, wetland restorations, and improvements to water quality in these regions. Collaborating closely with stakeholders and local communities, we strive to ensure access to safe, clean water, while addressing water-related challenges through sustainable water management across our operations.

Primary data on water extraction, categorised by source, is collected on a monthly basis. Progress towards water usage targets is monitored regularly using specialised software, ensuring accurate and timely tracking of performance. Monthly reviews with the management at local plant, country and Group level are performed to monitor performance and actions. Following the ESRS definition on water risk, we have 29 plants located in areas with certain water risk (lack of clean water and sanitation (WASH) for communities, water quality, reputational risk, high-water stress). Out of them, 20 plants are situated in watersheds with high-water stress as per the latest version of the WRI Aqueduct tool. For example, one of those watersheds is the Asopos River basin in Greece where we implement water replenishment activities in collaboration with the local municipality and NGOs. As per our internal evaluation, considering the local site-specific context, done for our Mission 2025 commitments, 19 of our plants are designated as priority plants, located in areas facing challenges related to basin water quantity, water quality or WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) for communities.

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystem SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model E4.SBM-3_05 Through our double materiality assessment, we have identified a material impact within our upstream value chain specifically related to land use change. However, no material impact has been identified in relation to soil degradation, desertification, or soil sealing. E4-1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model E4-1_01 Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems is one of our main sustainability priorities. Our biggest impact on the biodiversity landscape occurs in the upstream segment of our value chain, and it is related to the potential deforestation (land use change) from some agricultural commodities, mostly wood (used for our paper packaging materials). We are committed to eliminate deforestation of our main ingredients by 2025, and it is aligned with the recommendations by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for companies with Forest, Land and Agricultural Activities (FLAG). Due to FLAG recommendations we have updated our net zero plan as stated in ESRS E1. Also, in our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), we have requirements related to deforestation, and our target is to achieve 100% sustainable sourcing by 2025. We voluntarily report the sites which are adjacent to legally protected areas, and for all of them we have a confirmed ‘no negative impact’ by an external expert which performs so-called Source Vulnerability Assessment for all the water sources we use in direct operations. In 2022, we published our biodiversity statement where we set a goal to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in our operations and supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. The time horizons we use are defined as follows: short-term (2024), medium-term (2025-2030), and long-term (2031-2050). E4-1_02 Environmental risks at supplier level, including deforestation risk, are mitigated through our robust programme at procurement level. We annually review the risks and performance of all our suppliers against our SGPs, PSA principles for agricultural ingredients, Water Risk Assessment, as well as other equally important aspects that impact our business, such as supply risk and financial stability. Overall, it is important to point out that sustainability is one of the key criteria in supplier selection under strategic sourcing, as well as a criterion for the Annual Supplier Review process that we conduct cross-functionally across our supply base. In more detail, to ensure that suppliers demonstrate ESG requirements’ compliance we rely on multiple screening and assessment practices that offer us a holistic view of their performance. This means we collect primary and secondary data that we combine together and analyse to identify priority areas for critical to our operations suppliers. The Sustainable Agriculture programme secures ESG monitoring through PSA certification process of the Coca-Cola System across our main agricultural commodities. For the remaining supply base, we have designed a robust assessment journey leveraging ESG physical audits, as well as a number of globally recognised screening and assessment tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus, EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX, WWF Water Risk Filter Assessment, Resilience Event Watch, Exiger and Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, annual Supply Base Assessments are carried out by specialist consultants for Group Critical suppliers. These assessments evaluate Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers on various criteria, including water risk, climate change, forced labour, child labour, labour rights, biodiversity, and financial risk. In case of any risk identified, the supplier is asked to provide an action plan which is monitored regularly. For deforestation, we have a specific project in place where we perform readiness assessment for all our supplier under the requirements of EUDR and we are currently organising our internal process to ensure we are able to assess risks and take necessary actions on an on-going basis from the moment that EUDR is formally introduced as of 1st of January 2026.

"Sustainability Statement continued commodities, we are proactively collecting deforestation information from all agricultural ingredients suppliers across all our countries in order to have a holistic view of the exposure and potential risk. By the end of 2025, we will have a programme in place to cover any identified gaps. Last but not least, we are in process of implementing a deforestation tracking platform on top of any other activities already in motion, which will also be ready before the end of 2025. E4-1_03, 04, 05 The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has identified five pressures on nature: 1) land/water/sea use change, 2) resource exploitation, 3) climate change, 4) pollution and 5) invasive species. In 2023, we undertook the mapping and materiality assessment on biodiversity across our value chain and we assessed those pressures following the SBTN guideline step 1 and 2. We have collected all our activity data, covering: 1) upstream activities (volumes sourced and origin of raw materials), 2) direct operations (consumption of water and energy of all sites), and 3) downstream (packaging distribution by country). Then we translated the activity data into pressures on nature across five metrics. These pressures on nature were weighted by local nature vulnerability indicators assessing the state of nature in the locations where the activity occurs. Time horizons used in the analysis are as described in E4-1_01. We considered in the assumptions the tighter environmental regulations (e.g., EUDR), carbon pricing policies which would include land conversion activities, deforestation-free commitments from suppliers, and climate risks (e.g., water scarcity, extreme weather events). The result shows that the biggest impact we have is in upstream activities, mainly agricultural suppliers and their impact on land-use change or deforestation. Our procurement strategy to purchase certified raw materials that meet our PSA and our goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chain, support mitigation of the impact and also reduce any potential risk that may occur. E4-1_06 Relevance to stakeholder engagement is described in E4.MDR-T_11. E4-2 Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems E4.MDR-P_01 & E4-2_01, 20 We have adopted policies that address deforestation and sustainable land practices. Our overarching goal for biodiversity is to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Besides, we have set our Environmental Policy, the main objective of which is to minimise the environmental impact of the Group, and the Biodiversity Statement, the objective of which is to enhance biodiversity by reducing emissions and water use, by preserving and reinstating water priority areas, and by sourcing agricultural ingredients sustainably. Moreover, through the Biodiversity Statement, CCHBC is committed to promoting sustainable forest management and helping protect woodlands from deforestation and illegal harvesting. For the monitoring process, please refer to ESRS E1 section, as it constitutes the standard procedure applicable to all relevant topics. Our policies support biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, and responsible sourcing. We are committed to achieving a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas by 2040 and eliminating deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Thus, our policies address ecosystem protection, sustainable forest management, and mitigation of environmental impacts. We recognise the importance of biodiversity for long-term resilience, as our Natural Capital Impact Study and Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVA) help identify key dependencies and risks, while sustainable sourcing practices mitigate transition risks. We implement traceability mechanisms through certifications, verification schemes, and supplier requirements aligned with The Coca-Cola Company’s Principles for Sustainable Agriculture and EcoVadis assessments. Moreover, our policies prioritise collaboration with NGOs, communities, and industry stakeholders to ensure sustainable supply chains that respect human rights, promote responsible land use, and protect natural ecosystems. E4.MDR-P_02 The policies are applicable across all geographies where Coca-Cola HBC operates. Among the affected stakeholder groups, farmers, other suppliers and local communities associated with the Group’s upstream value chain, are most significantly impacted. E4.MDR-P_03 Policies/statements related to environment (including biodiversity) are approved and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors, and they apply to all Coca-Cola HBC employees, regardless of level and function. E4.MDR-P_04 & E4-2_02 In June 2022, we joined the SBTN Corporate Engagement Program. We will continue working to implement the SBTN’s guidance, in order to map and assess the material impacts on biodiversity of our critical commodities and suppliers and then set science-based targets in priority areas. E4.MDR-P_05 We engage with a broad range of stakeholder groups for biodiversity, including our communities, governments, NGOs, investors and suppliers, taking into account their recommendations in the process of setting biodiversity-related policy. For more information, please refer to E1 section. E4.MDR-P_06 The Environmental Policy and the Biodiversity Statement are publicly available at our site (Policies | Coca-Cola HBC), which affected stakeholders can easily access. E4-2_03 The critical areas in our supply chain are defined based on the material dependencies that we have in relation to biodiversity, for example the provision of water, agricultural raw materials and wood. E4-2_04 We started mapping all our operations and critical commodities/suppliers. For our sustainability assessment, we use the risk-based approach with the support of our partners (EcoVadis). Transparency and traceability of material supply chains is established through certifications/ verification schemes or by ensuring suppliers have robust traceability of supply that meets our expectations (please see ‘Supplier Engagement, Verification and Assurance’ from TCCC Principles for Sustainable Agriculture). Also, we regularly measure and report on the progress made against our Mission 2025 commitments, and all other commitments, including those related to biodiversity and deforestation. The annual performance is disclosed in our Annual Report and the GRI Content Index, verified by an independent auditor, and published on our website. E4-2_05, 06, 07, 18 We are committed to sourcing 100% of our key ingredients in line with the Principles for Sustainable Agriculture as set out by TCCC. These principles protect and support biodiversity and ecosystems, uphold human and workplace rights, ensure animal health and welfare, and help build thriving communities. They apply to primary production, i.e., at farm level, and form the basis for our continued engagement with Tier 1 suppliers to ensure sustainable long-term supply at a lower environmental impact. This extends in particular to the sections Conservation of Forests, Conservation of Natural Habitats, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Soil Management and Agrochemical Management.

We took into consideration the best global practices and guidelines such as the SBTN, FAO Good Agricultural Practices, ILO and EU regulations. Targets are monitored quarterly by obtaining information from suppliers for their sustainable certifications. The amount of procured quantity of raw materials certified is divided by the total procured volume for the raw materials in scope. Current status is as per the initial plans. Targets are set for the upstream part of the value chain due to the biggest impact there. E4.MDR-T_10 & E4-4_05 The targets set are in line with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and its mission to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery, and they are aligned with EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy, where the goal for protecting 30% of land in the EU is stated as well as with the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EU DR). E4.MDR-T_11 Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions take place, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Also, during the supplier sustainability events we organise regularly, we discuss different ESG aspects, including biodiversity and deforestation. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. Moreover, we have conducted several meetings with our main sugar and sweeteners suppliers where we discussed environmental topics, among them the deforestation issue. E4-5 Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change E4-5_04 Our operations are primarily based in cities, so we do not have a direct impact on biodiversity and ecosystem change.

We have committed to our NetZeroby40 journey since 2021, and the healthy liquidity position of the Group ensures proper funding of relevant initiatives every year. Our climate transition plan, first developed in 2021, covers the full value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) and it is as per the 1.5 degree scenario, approved by the SBTi. Developed by a cross-functional team of experts, the plan was approved by the ELT (through Sustainability SteerCo) and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the BoD. Coca-Cola HBC considers five main levers and those are the main actions for each lever: 1. Manufacturing (includes scope 1 fuels used, scope 1 losses of CO2 used for beverage carbonation, scope 2 electricity/heat/steam/ hot water purchased) • Continue implementing and accelerating the energy-efficient projects in our plants (deployment of energy saving projects, old equipment modernization, and installation of heat pumps & electrification). • Improving the CO2 yield in the plants. • Accelerating usage of renewable and/ or cleaner energy to replace fossil fuel in scope 1 or electricity/heat/steam/ hot water in scope 2. 2. Transportation (includes scope 1 fuels used for own transport, both light and heavy, and scope 3 fuels used for outsourced logistics and transportation) • Optimising the routes of light and heavy fleet, increasing logistics efficiency and increasing heavy trucks utilization. • Shifting the existing fleet to innovative technologies and renewable or alternative fuels. • Enhancing the strategic partnerships with our third-party logistics providers and joint investments (accelerate shifting to alternative fuels, route to market evolution, shifting of more volume to trains and applying industry innovations). 3. Packaging (includes scope 3 from all primary, secondary and tertiary packaging used for our products) • Implementing our Packaging Mix of the Future strategy (increasing recycled PET, moving from non-reusable one-way glass bottles to reusable glass bottles and providing more packageless solutions). • Implementing decarbonisation of our primary and secondary packaging materials (aluminium cans, PET bottles, glass bottles, plastic labels, closures, stretch films etc.). 4. Ingredients (includes scope 3 from all ingredients used for manufacturing of our beverages) • Decarbonisation initiatives with our suppliers (engagement of farmers through co- development of farming pilots with suppliers, using regenerative agricultural practices). • Continue reformulation of our products and moving to more lights and zero products in our beverage portfolio. 5. Drink Equipment (includes scope 3 of electricity used by our customers for the drink equipment we provide, scope 1 for refrigerant losses from cold drink equipment) • Accelerate the process of providing energy efficient drink equipment to our customers and finding innovative solutions for further energy efficiency of our drink equipment. • Greening the electricity grid mainly in Europe and with slower pace in Africa.

"Sustainability Statement continued For more details on emissions reduction per lever, please see Table 9: Mitigation actions per decarbonisation lever. Coca-Cola HBC is not excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. NetZeroby40 roadmap is presented in the Strategic Report, section ‘Earn our Licence to operate’ on page 25. In 2024, we invested €200 million of capital expenditure (Capex) on projects supporting the implementation of our climate transition plan, representing 29.4% of total Capex. We also invested €30 million driven by the higher cost of recycled PET compared to virgin PET, as we pursue our strategic objective to reach 35% rPET by 2025, positively influencing both the reduction of our scope 3 emissions and the transition to a circular economy. Our accounting system does not separately classify sustainability-related investments or costs, as both are reported in accordance with the general financial reporting principles. For Capex, however, we apply an internal process to identify expenditures fully aligned with the levers of the transition plan. This allows us to track and monitor investments that directly support our commitment to emissions’ reduction but does not necessarily consider larger investments that have multiple objectives, even when sustainability is one of them. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our financial statements, as part of the overall amounts reported in the cash flow statement and the income statement, reinforcing our climate change mitigation actions. In 2025, we plan to follow a similar approach, investing 30% of total Capex on projects supporting the implementation of our climate transition plan. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared to virgin PET will increase further in 2025 to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. In the medium term, for the period 2026-2030, Capex investments that support our transition plan will gradually increase to reach 37% of Capex in 2030. Main drivers are the acceleration of investments to improve energy efficiency of our manufacturing plants and using more renewable fuel alternatives, the switch to coolers with even better energy profile and the increase in the contribution of returnable glass bottles to our package portfolio. As far as investments in Opex/ Cogs are concerned, we expect that they will also gradually increase, as we will use more packaging materials with recycled content and purchase more ingredients that are sustainably sourced. For the period after 2030, we expect to continue on the 2025-2030 trajectory of investments, both Capex and Opex/Cogs to support the faster reduction of emissions so that we can meet our NetZeroby40 commitment. Given the fast-paced nature of our business, being a consumer goods company, the rapid technological advancements, and the uncertainty in the regulatory environment, an attempt to assign investment amounts per decarbonisation action could result in misleading information. Hence, we maintain the approach we have followed in the past few years and report the percentage of total Capex that is related to projects that support the implementation of our transition plan. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals and EU Environmental Objectives. Financing mechanisms include a diverse range of instruments, ensuring flexibility in meeting both current and future financial requirements for action plans. The Group’s €500 million green bond, issued in September 2022 under the Green Finance Framework, was fully allocated to eligible projects by September 2023, as detailed in our Green Finance Report. Our sustainability-linked revolving credit facility of €800 million remains available until April 2026, although not specifically earmarked for funding the transition plan. These initiatives complement the Group’s broader access to diversified financial resources. Further details on financial instruments and resource allocation are available in Note 25, p.306. E1-1_07 By 2030, the only assets from scope 1 and 2 in manufacturing that could potentially lead to significant locked-in GHG emissions are the CHP plants outside Europe and boilers used in manufacturing facilities, as they will still operate with fossil fuels (natural gas mainly), and it will be difficult to switch to alternative or renewable fuels. We will run an innovation project in two of the manufacturing sites to use biomass for the boilers and based on the results we are planning to implement across all plants by 2040. In logistics, we will have around 2,000 own trucks (scope 1) by 2030 using fossil fuel. In light fleet, which is leased and changed every four years, we don’t expect significant locked-in emissions. As per our NetZeroby40 commitment, by 2050 we will not have main assets with significant locked-in emissions: CHP in operations will be either decommissioned or replaced by renewable fuel, and boilers’ fuel will be replaced by alternative systems. By 2050, we don’t expect any of our own trucks to run on fossil fuel. Cumulatively, by 2030 those locked-in emissions would be around 256,000 tonnes of CO2e or 6.9% of our scope 1, 2, 3 emissions. Those locked-in emissions are not likely to affect our NetZeroby40 commitment, as they will be effectively managed and minimised before 2040 as shared above. As we sell beverages, we don’t expect significant locked-in emissions in scope 3 category ‘Use of sold products’, neither by 2030 nor by 2040 or 2050. ESRS 2 SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model E1.SBM-3_01,05 Climate change – caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, emitted from every business and activity – is leading to global temperature increase and extreme weather conditions around the world. Global warming impacts environment and society across our entire value chain: from suppliers, to customers and consumers. Managing our carbon footprint is our major transition risk related to climate change in the mid and long term, as emerged from the 2024 Double Materiality Assessment. The time horizons applied in the analysis and their business scenarios alignment are: • Short-term horizon: 2025 Annual business planning cycle which includes consideration of short-term risks and opportunities that affect annual performance objectives. • Medium-term horizon: 2030 Long-range planning that includes consideration of risks and opportunities that may affect medium-term objectives, financial viability assurance and allocation of capital for medium-term investments. • Long-term horizon: >2030 Long-term strategic planning including capital investments, mergers and acquisitions, impact of climate change, including meeting our NetZeroby40 commitments. Further details on the DMA process can be found in the ‘Materiality’ section of the IAR on pages 37 to 40 and on page 59 of this document.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1.SBM-3_02 We have a thoroughly designed Business Resilience programme that enables us to proactively manage risks – and embrace opportunities – so that we grow sustainably and meet our short-, medium- and long-term objectives. One of the most significant risks to our resilience over the longer term is climate change. By proactively preparing for and managing climate risk through our business strategy and capital investments, however, we can harness significant opportunities. E1.SBM-3_03,04 In our resilience analysis conducted in 2024, we used a variety of climate scenarios in our assessment of the potential impact of climate change on our business, including: RCP1.9, in order to be consistent with our Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) commitment and as representation of a best-case scenario from a climate action point of view; RCP4.5, as it represents the stated policy position and provides a midpoint scenario, and; RCP8.5, as the ‘worst- case’ or ‘extreme’ scenario, particularly for physical risks. This enabled us to consider a broad range of drivers and their impact. In considering the cost of carbon emissions, the more ambitious scenarios assume a greater amount of government use of regulation, taxes and levies and hence the higher costs of carbon. However, we also assumed that government intervention would not be consistent across all our markets given our diverse operating territories, and therefore countries were grouped into leaders, followers and laggards in evaluating potential increases in taxes and levies. As around 90% of our carbon emissions are scope 3, we are dependent on suppliers and customers reducing their carbon emissions. In estimating the reduction in overall carbon emissions and our ability to meet our NetZeroby40 targets, we used NGFS data to estimate industry decarbonisation rates which are assumptions built into our internal plans for meeting our NetZeroby40 target. Included in our assessment of the impact of climate change on our production and distribution, we used external data used by the insurance industry which we consider to be robust. However, we note that climate-related data can project general changes under different climate scenarios, but cannot predict the timing and severity of extreme events, which our facilities are most at risk from. We used assumptions on projected increases in insurance premiums from statements made by the insurance industry on the impact of climate change, however, we note that the impact that those projections are based on may not apply to us as they do not take into account the actions we are taking to adapt to and mitigate the impact of environmental changes. We used a number of internal assumptions about production volume increases to 2040 in order to estimate carbon emissions and resource usage, but we recognise that a considerable number of variables, such as domestic growth rates in each of our operating countries, changes in consumer demand and preferences, weather, industry actions and competition and government regulations, may affect those estimates. E1.SBM-3_06 As a result of our resilience analysis, we continued to improve our assessment of the effects of climate change, with a focus on clear targets and robust action plans. This enables us to deliver on our commitments, mitigate risks and take advantage of the opportunities inherent in change. E1.SBM-3_07 We are keenly aware of the importance of delivering on our plans and the potential to adjust our strategy to respond to emerging needs and priorities. We continue to decarbonise our value chain, while updating our net zero transition plan and developing long-term climate scenarios. We are also working towards our bold commitment to achieving a net-positive impact on biodiversity by 2040 in critical areas of our value chain, implementing the guidelines of the Science Based Targets Network, and we shifted our deforestation-free commitment from 2030 to 2025. We continue to expand our partnerships and seek new collaborations, as our ambitious goals and commitments can only be achieved through collective action. With prudent financial risk management, the Group maintains a healthy liquidity position and access to various funding sources. As of 31 December 2024, the Group had €1.6 billion available under €5.0 billion Euro medium term note programme, €0.8 billion available under €1.0 billion Euro-commercial paper programme, undrawn revolving credit facility of €0.8 billion and several bilateral bank loan facilities. None of the Group’s debt facilities are subject to financial covenants that could impact liquidity or access to capital. For further details, refer to Note 25, p.306. Strong treasury governance ensures a consistent supply of committed funding at both central and operational levels, optimising liquidity and funding risk management to secure the most efficient financing solutions. This diversified funding strategy supports both operational and strategic needs, enabling the Group to allocate resources effectively to the net zero transition plan as necessary.

We know our competitiveness and long-term success depend on the sustainability of our operations and the resilience of our value chain”. We have not identified direct harm to any stakeholders’ group from our actual impact. All actions we take are towards decarbonisation by following the applicable regulatory, industry and international standards. E1.MDR-A_05 In 2024, we made progress on our climate-related actions and plans and for the fourth consecutive year we reached our annual roadmap: • continued our decarbonisation journey in all five levers in alignment with our NetZeroby40 roadmap; • focused on packaging decarbonisation using a higher percentage of recycled materials and improving percentage packaging collection; • supported further roll-out of Deposit Return Schemes in our EU markets; • promoted Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies and the launch of new packaging collection systems in priority markets; • cooperated with eight other industry players and three organisations to publish CSR Europe Biodiversity Alliance White Paper “How Companies in Europe Address Biodiversity’; • expanded our partnerships in water and waste reduction. In 2021, we committed to achieve net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040. This is our most ambitious, complex and forward-looking commitment. We were among the first companies to adopt science-based reduction targets. In our existing net zero roadmap, our starting point is 2017, the baseline for our science-based targets. We have reduced our absolute total value chain emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 31% (excluding Egypt) from 2010 to the end of 2024, our absolute value chain reduction in 2024 versus 2017 is 18% (excluding Egypt). These results come from our sustained investment and focus, and highlight our consistent approach to decarbonisation. Reducing carbon emissions is the non-negotiable goal for our business. We continued to work across our value chain to reduce emissions, with a particular focus on energy efficiency and renewal, packaging, coolers and ingredients. We do this because we will make the biggest progress by delivering sustainable solutions in these parts of our value chain.

"Sustainability Statement continued In 2024, we updated our net zero roadmap with three important changes. We integrated our Egyptian operations into our 2030 and NetZeroby40 climate targets, we added new Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) targets, and we updated our mid-term emissions goal to follow the Well-Below-2-Degrees (WB2D) pathway until 2030 and then the 1.5 degrees pathway until 2040. Due to the FLAG targets requirements, we are moving our baseline year for the mid-term 2030 emissions reduction targets from 2017 to 2019. With all those changes, our NetZeroby40 target was formally validated by the SBTi. As the validation came in December 2024, in 2025 we will work to update the roadmap with all those changes and communicate transparently on our website. E1-3_01,03,04 Table 9: Mitigation actions per decarbonisation lever (action, GHG reductions) The actions per lever consider our updated net zero roadmap as approved by the SBTi in late December 2024. It includes Egypt acquisition, scope 3 accelerated climate scenario (well below 2 degree Celsius), and a new baseline year of 2019 (instead of 2017) as per the SBTi Net Zero guideline and the SBTi requirements for FLAG emissions, where 2017 cannot be used as a baseline year. We are going to perform carbon boundary review and recalculation of our emissions to include FLAG factors in 2025 and will update the roadmap accordingly.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1-3_07,08, E1-1_04,06,08 As detailed in the EU Taxonomy section of this sustainability statement, our core economic activity is not yet included in the published Delegated Acts and is therefore not considered Taxonomy-eligible at this stage. However, we have assessed secondary activities that contribute to climate change mitigation. In 2024, 0.67% of total Capex was Taxonomy-aligned, also driven by activities connected to our climate transition plan. Specifically, CCM4.25 ‘Production of heat/cool using waste heat’ , CCM7.4 ‘Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings’ and CE1.1 ‘Manufacture of plastic packaging goods’ contributed to aligned Capex. We have also assessed CCM6.5 ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles’, which relates to the electrification of our fleet. Although a significant part of our fleet meets the TSC, due to challenges with the DNSH criteria, we will claim zero alignment to EU Taxonomy in 2024. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain or increase EU Taxonomy alignment as we continue to evaluate investment plans and operational expenditures in areas that could become eligible with the introduction of regulatory updates. Metrics and targets E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation E1.MDR-T_01,02,03,05,06,07, E1-4_01,24 NetZeroby40 Multiple climate scenarios have been taken into consideration, as outlined in SBM-3_08_09_10, helping assess external drivers, including policy developments and market shifts. In October 2021, we announced our NetZeroby40 transition plan, as part of our commitment to reach net zero absolute emissions across all scopes by 2040. This target is fully aligned with the 1.5 degree pathway, and it was approved by the SBTi in December 2024 (link to the SBTi website). NetZeroby40 is a carbon emissions roadmap including our base-year results, year-on-year emissions targets, 2030 near-term and our 2040 net zero targets. The plan’s main targets are: Overall net-zero target: • Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2040. Near-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 27.5% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 33.3% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.* Coca- Cola HBC AG commits to no deforestation across its primary deforestation-linked commodities, with a target date of December 31, 2025. * The target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Long-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 90% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 72% by 2040 from a 2019 base year.* * This target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Science-based targets: please see above. Mission 2025 Developed in 2018, Mission 2025 is a set of sustainability commitments based on our stakeholder materiality matrix and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets. It spans across six key focus areas to cover our entire value chain, including emissions reduction, with the following commitments: • Reduce direct carbon emissions ratio by 30% vs 2017. • 50% of our refrigerators in customer outlets will be energy efficient. • 50% of total energy used in our plants will be from renewable and clean sources. • 100% of the total electricity used in our plants in EU and Switzerland will be from renewable and clean source. E1.MDR-T_04 Our recently approved by the SBTi targets for reducing scope 1 and 2 and scope 3 emissions have organisation-wide coverage. We are covering 100% of our operational activities.E1.MDR-T_10 As previously mentioned, our climate change commitments cover our entire Company, all scope 1, 2, 3, and we aim to reach net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040 as per the 1.5 degree scenario, as well as our intermediate emissions reduction target by 2030 is approved by the SBTi. E1.MDR-T_08 The Group’s annual roadmap of net zero target by 2040 is shown in the net zero chart in the strategic part of the IAR, section ‘License to operate’, page 25. Mission 2025 targets related to climate and energy are disclosed in the Strategic Report, ‘Key performance indicators’ section on pages 33 to 34. Those targets don’t have interim targets, but only annual roadmaps at Group level disaggregated further down per BU. E1.MDR-T_09, E1-4_22 At the end of 2020, we set and received approval by the SBTi of our Science-Based Targets by 2030, as our previous SBT period-closing was end of 2020. Those targets are reported in the 2024 IAR (as an old roadmap): Reduction of absolute scope 1, 2 emissions by 55% by 2030 vs 2017 baseline following the 1.5 degree global warming scenario and reduction of scope 3 emissions by 21% by 2030 vs. 2017. So far, we have achieved 31% reduction of our operational emissions vs 2017 (excluding Egypt). Those approved by the SBTi targets are without the integrated new acquisition, Coca-Cola HBC Egypt operations, as its integration happened in 2022, after targets submission and approval in 2021.For the newest targets, approved by the SBTi in December 2024, please refer to previous page (Net Zero targets and FLAG targets). We report as per the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. We are covering 100% of our operational activities. We account and report all seven GHG emissions and report those as equivalent to CO2. Under scope 2 emissions, we are reporting market-based GHG emissions and separately the location-based scope 2 emissions. Our climate targets are also aligned with the UN SDG Target 13.1, i.e. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries, as well as Targets 7.2 and 7.3 on increased renewable energy and energy efficiency. We do not use any carbon removal nor neutralisation or off-setting/insetting methodologies to achieve our GHG internal annual roadmap targets as per the SBTi guidelines. E1.MDR-T_11 The Group sets measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets on material sustainability matters through a structured and inclusive process. Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions are taken, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. The UN SDGs also form a crucial foundation for the Group’s target- setting process, guiding our efforts in addressing global sustainability challenges. Through this comprehensive approach, the Group ensures that its targets are relevant, ambitious and responsive to both stakeholder input and global standards.

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystem SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model E4.SBM-3_05 Through our double materiality assessment, we have identified a material impact within our upstream value chain specifically related to land use change. However, no material impact has been identified in relation to soil degradation, desertification, or soil sealing. E4-1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model E4-1_01 Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems is one of our main sustainability priorities. Our biggest impact on the biodiversity landscape occurs in the upstream segment of our value chain, and it is related to the potential deforestation (land use change) from some agricultural commodities, mostly wood (used for our paper packaging materials). We are committed to eliminate deforestation of our main ingredients by 2025, and it is aligned with the recommendations by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for companies with Forest, Land and Agricultural Activities (FLAG). Due to FLAG recommendations we have updated our net zero plan as stated in ESRS E1. Also, in our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), we have requirements related to deforestation, and our target is to achieve 100% sustainable sourcing by 2025. We voluntarily report the sites which are adjacent to legally protected areas, and for all of them we have a confirmed ‘no negative impact’ by an external expert which performs so-called Source Vulnerability Assessment for all the water sources we use in direct operations. In 2022, we published our biodiversity statement where we set a goal to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in our operations and supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. The time horizons we use are defined as follows: short-term (2024), medium-term (2025-2030), and long-term (2031-2050). E4-1_02 Environmental risks at supplier level, including deforestation risk, are mitigated through our robust programme at procurement level. We annually review the risks and performance of all our suppliers against our SGPs, PSA principles for agricultural ingredients, Water Risk Assessment, as well as other equally important aspects that impact our business, such as supply risk and financial stability. Overall, it is important to point out that sustainability is one of the key criteria in supplier selection under strategic sourcing, as well as a criterion for the Annual Supplier Review process that we conduct cross-functionally across our supply base. In more detail, to ensure that suppliers demonstrate ESG requirements’ compliance we rely on multiple screening and assessment practices that offer us a holistic view of their performance. This means we collect primary and secondary data that we combine together and analyse to identify priority areas for critical to our operations suppliers. The Sustainable Agriculture programme secures ESG monitoring through PSA certification process of the Coca-Cola System across our main agricultural commodities. For the remaining supply base, we have designed a robust assessment journey leveraging ESG physical audits, as well as a number of globally recognised screening and assessment tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus, EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX, WWF Water Risk Filter Assessment, Resilience Event Watch, Exiger and Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, annual Supply Base Assessments are carried out by specialist consultants for Group Critical suppliers. These assessments evaluate Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers on various criteria, including water risk, climate change, forced labour, child labour, labour rights, biodiversity, and financial risk. In case of any risk identified, the supplier is asked to provide an action plan which is monitored regularly. For deforestation, we have a specific project in place where we perform readiness assessment for all our supplier under the requirements of EUDR and we are currently organising our internal process to ensure we are able to assess risks and take necessary actions on an on-going basis from the moment that EUDR is formally introduced as of 1st of January 2026.

"Sustainability Statement continued commodities, we are proactively collecting deforestation information from all agricultural ingredients suppliers across all our countries in order to have a holistic view of the exposure and potential risk. By the end of 2025, we will have a programme in place to cover any identified gaps. Last but not least, we are in process of implementing a deforestation tracking platform on top of any other activities already in motion, which will also be ready before the end of 2025. E4-1_03, 04, 05 The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has identified five pressures on nature: 1) land/water/sea use change, 2) resource exploitation, 3) climate change, 4) pollution and 5) invasive species. In 2023, we undertook the mapping and materiality assessment on biodiversity across our value chain and we assessed those pressures following the SBTN guideline step 1 and 2. We have collected all our activity data, covering: 1) upstream activities (volumes sourced and origin of raw materials), 2) direct operations (consumption of water and energy of all sites), and 3) downstream (packaging distribution by country). Then we translated the activity data into pressures on nature across five metrics. These pressures on nature were weighted by local nature vulnerability indicators assessing the state of nature in the locations where the activity occurs. Time horizons used in the analysis are as described in E4-1_01. We considered in the assumptions the tighter environmental regulations (e.g., EUDR), carbon pricing policies which would include land conversion activities, deforestation-free commitments from suppliers, and climate risks (e.g., water scarcity, extreme weather events). The result shows that the biggest impact we have is in upstream activities, mainly agricultural suppliers and their impact on land-use change or deforestation. Our procurement strategy to purchase certified raw materials that meet our PSA and our goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chain, support mitigation of the impact and also reduce any potential risk that may occur. E4-1_06 Relevance to stakeholder engagement is described in E4.MDR-T_11. E4-2 Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems E4.MDR-P_01 & E4-2_01, 20 We have adopted policies that address deforestation and sustainable land practices. Our overarching goal for biodiversity is to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Besides, we have set our Environmental Policy, the main objective of which is to minimise the environmental impact of the Group, and the Biodiversity Statement, the objective of which is to enhance biodiversity by reducing emissions and water use, by preserving and reinstating water priority areas, and by sourcing agricultural ingredients sustainably. Moreover, through the Biodiversity Statement, CCHBC is committed to promoting sustainable forest management and helping protect woodlands from deforestation and illegal harvesting. For the monitoring process, please refer to ESRS E1 section, as it constitutes the standard procedure applicable to all relevant topics. Our policies support biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, and responsible sourcing. We are committed to achieving a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas by 2040 and eliminating deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Thus, our policies address ecosystem protection, sustainable forest management, and mitigation of environmental impacts. We recognise the importance of biodiversity for long-term resilience, as our Natural Capital Impact Study and Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVA) help identify key dependencies and risks, while sustainable sourcing practices mitigate transition risks. We implement traceability mechanisms through certifications, verification schemes, and supplier requirements aligned with The Coca-Cola Company’s Principles for Sustainable Agriculture and EcoVadis assessments. Moreover, our policies prioritise collaboration with NGOs, communities, and industry stakeholders to ensure sustainable supply chains that respect human rights, promote responsible land use, and protect natural ecosystems. E4.MDR-P_02 The policies are applicable across all geographies where Coca-Cola HBC operates. Among the affected stakeholder groups, farmers, other suppliers and local communities associated with the Group’s upstream value chain, are most significantly impacted. E4.MDR-P_03 Policies/statements related to environment (including biodiversity) are approved and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors, and they apply to all Coca-Cola HBC employees, regardless of level and function. E4.MDR-P_04 & E4-2_02 In June 2022, we joined the SBTN Corporate Engagement Program. We will continue working to implement the SBTN’s guidance, in order to map and assess the material impacts on biodiversity of our critical commodities and suppliers and then set science-based targets in priority areas. E4.MDR-P_05 We engage with a broad range of stakeholder groups for biodiversity, including our communities, governments, NGOs, investors and suppliers, taking into account their recommendations in the process of setting biodiversity-related policy. For more information, please refer to E1 section. E4.MDR-P_06 The Environmental Policy and the Biodiversity Statement are publicly available at our site (Policies | Coca-Cola HBC), which affected stakeholders can easily access. E4-2_03 The critical areas in our supply chain are defined based on the material dependencies that we have in relation to biodiversity, for example the provision of water, agricultural raw materials and wood. E4-2_04 We started mapping all our operations and critical commodities/suppliers. For our sustainability assessment, we use the risk-based approach with the support of our partners (EcoVadis). Transparency and traceability of material supply chains is established through certifications/ verification schemes or by ensuring suppliers have robust traceability of supply that meets our expectations (please see ‘Supplier Engagement, Verification and Assurance’ from TCCC Principles for Sustainable Agriculture). Also, we regularly measure and report on the progress made against our Mission 2025 commitments, and all other commitments, including those related to biodiversity and deforestation. The annual performance is disclosed in our Annual Report and the GRI Content Index, verified by an independent auditor, and published on our website. E4-2_05, 06, 07, 18 We are committed to sourcing 100% of our key ingredients in line with the Principles for Sustainable Agriculture as set out by TCCC. These principles protect and support biodiversity and ecosystems, uphold human and workplace rights, ensure animal health and welfare, and help build thriving communities. They apply to primary production, i.e., at farm level, and form the basis for our continued engagement with Tier 1 suppliers to ensure sustainable long-term supply at a lower environmental impact. This extends in particular to the sections Conservation of Forests, Conservation of Natural Habitats, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Soil Management and Agrochemical Management.

We took into consideration the best global practices and guidelines such as the SBTN, FAO Good Agricultural Practices, ILO and EU regulations. Targets are monitored quarterly by obtaining information from suppliers for their sustainable certifications. The amount of procured quantity of raw materials certified is divided by the total procured volume for the raw materials in scope. Current status is as per the initial plans. Targets are set for the upstream part of the value chain due to the biggest impact there. E4.MDR-T_10 & E4-4_05 The targets set are in line with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and its mission to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery, and they are aligned with EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy, where the goal for protecting 30% of land in the EU is stated as well as with the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EU DR). E4.MDR-T_11 Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions take place, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Also, during the supplier sustainability events we organise regularly, we discuss different ESG aspects, including biodiversity and deforestation. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. Moreover, we have conducted several meetings with our main sugar and sweeteners suppliers where we discussed environmental topics, among them the deforestation issue. E4-5 Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change E4-5_04 Our operations are primarily based in cities, so we do not have a direct impact on biodiversity and ecosystem change.

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E5 – Resource use and circular economy Impact, risk and opportunity management E5-1 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5.MDR-P_01 Packaging plays a vital role in keeping our products fresh and safe. Sustainable packaging and waste management are important to our business, given the amount of packaging we use, the variety of pack materials we use and the need to recover and recycle them after consumption. E5-1_03 & E5-1_04 Beverage packaging has value and life beyond its initial use, and we believe that it should be collected and recycled into a new package as part of a circular economy. To deliver this vision, we own, invest in and take responsibility for collected packaging material as members of authorised recovery organisations. Our commitments E5.MDR-P_01 & E5.MDR-P_04 We are committed to continually improving our environmental performance in the areas of packaging and packaging waste. Since packaging remains critical for us, as already stated through our DMA, and thus we have adopted the ‘Packaging Waste Management Policy’. This policy includes objectives relevant both to packaging materials and packaging waste, and as all our environmental policies, it considers the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and the GRI Standards. E5-1_01 & E5.MDR-P_01 Our Packaging Waste Management Policy commits to collect the equivalent of 75% of our packaging for recycling or reuse by 2025, use 35% recycled PET (rPET) by 2025 in our PET bottles, and in the EU countries, our objective is to reach 50% rPET by 2025. We also are committed to have 100% recyclable by design primary packaging materials and to invest in recycling infrastructure and new technologies that enable increased usage of recycled content in our packaging, where technically and economically feasible. E5-1_03 & E5-1_04 Additionally, for our engagements regarding recyclability and recycled packaging, we have included targets relevant to: • Collection: Recover 75% of our primary packaging for recycling or reuse by 2025. • Eliminate Unnecessary Packaging: Building on the extensive light-weighting programme delivered over the past decade, we will continue to light-weight our primary packaging towards ‘best-in-class‘ bottles and cans in each market, while innovating to remove shrink film from multipacks. • Expand Reusable Packaging: Deliver programmes to increase reusable packaging from 12% of transactions sold in ‘returnable’, and 4% in ‘dispensed,’ formats. • Reduce Virgin Plastic: Through the increased use of circular PET (rPET), light-weighting, removal of plastic film and expansion of reusable packaging formats. • Innovation: Deliver new sustainable packaging solutions through partnerships and R&D. • Inspire and Engage Consumers: Use the power of our brands to encourage consumers to recycle. E5-1_02 & E5.MDR-P_02 Furthermore, under the umbrella of our Biodiversity Statement, as already mentioned in the ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystem, sustainable sourcing of packaging is also taken into account. We aim to source all our paper-based primary packaging materials from sustainable forest sources. All our paper bricks we use are FSC-certified. The scope of our commitments is to improve the circularity of our packaging and to avoid packaging waste, which in turn contributes to better environmental performance. Among the key areas we focus on, and relevant to the materiality analysis, is the circular economy. We take action to improve packaging sustainability, including its recycling into new packages and measuring, evaluating and sharing progress across regions and stakeholders, providing the respective transparency.

We know our competitiveness and long-term success depend on the sustainability of our operations and the resilience of our value chain”. We have not identified direct harm to any stakeholders’ group from our actual impact. All actions we take are towards decarbonisation by following the applicable regulatory, industry and international standards. E1.MDR-A_05 In 2024, we made progress on our climate-related actions and plans and for the fourth consecutive year we reached our annual roadmap: • continued our decarbonisation journey in all five levers in alignment with our NetZeroby40 roadmap; • focused on packaging decarbonisation using a higher percentage of recycled materials and improving percentage packaging collection; • supported further roll-out of Deposit Return Schemes in our EU markets; • promoted Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies and the launch of new packaging collection systems in priority markets; • cooperated with eight other industry players and three organisations to publish CSR Europe Biodiversity Alliance White Paper “How Companies in Europe Address Biodiversity’; • expanded our partnerships in water and waste reduction. In 2021, we committed to achieve net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040. This is our most ambitious, complex and forward-looking commitment. We were among the first companies to adopt science-based reduction targets. In our existing net zero roadmap, our starting point is 2017, the baseline for our science-based targets. We have reduced our absolute total value chain emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 31% (excluding Egypt) from 2010 to the end of 2024, our absolute value chain reduction in 2024 versus 2017 is 18% (excluding Egypt). These results come from our sustained investment and focus, and highlight our consistent approach to decarbonisation. Reducing carbon emissions is the non-negotiable goal for our business. We continued to work across our value chain to reduce emissions, with a particular focus on energy efficiency and renewal, packaging, coolers and ingredients. We do this because we will make the biggest progress by delivering sustainable solutions in these parts of our value chain.

"Sustainability Statement continued In 2024, we updated our net zero roadmap with three important changes. We integrated our Egyptian operations into our 2030 and NetZeroby40 climate targets, we added new Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) targets, and we updated our mid-term emissions goal to follow the Well-Below-2-Degrees (WB2D) pathway until 2030 and then the 1.5 degrees pathway until 2040. Due to the FLAG targets requirements, we are moving our baseline year for the mid-term 2030 emissions reduction targets from 2017 to 2019. With all those changes, our NetZeroby40 target was formally validated by the SBTi. As the validation came in December 2024, in 2025 we will work to update the roadmap with all those changes and communicate transparently on our website.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1-3_07,08, E1-1_04,06,08 As detailed in the EU Taxonomy section of this sustainability statement, our core economic activity is not yet included in the published Delegated Acts and is therefore not considered Taxonomy-eligible at this stage. However, we have assessed secondary activities that contribute to climate change mitigation. In 2024, 0.67% of total Capex was Taxonomy-aligned, also driven by activities connected to our climate transition plan. Specifically, CCM4.25 ‘Production of heat/cool using waste heat’ , CCM7.4 ‘Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings’ and CE1.1 ‘Manufacture of plastic packaging goods’ contributed to aligned Capex. We have also assessed CCM6.5 ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles’, which relates to the electrification of our fleet. Although a significant part of our fleet meets the TSC, due to challenges with the DNSH criteria, we will claim zero alignment to EU Taxonomy in 2024. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain or increase EU Taxonomy alignment as we continue to evaluate investment plans and operational expenditures in areas that could become eligible with the introduction of regulatory updates. Metrics and targets E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation E1.MDR-T_01,02,03,05,06,07, E1-4_01,24 NetZeroby40 Multiple climate scenarios have been taken into consideration, as outlined in SBM-3_08_09_10, helping assess external drivers, including policy developments and market shifts. In October 2021, we announced our NetZeroby40 transition plan, as part of our commitment to reach net zero absolute emissions across all scopes by 2040. This target is fully aligned with the 1.5 degree pathway, and it was approved by the SBTi in December 2024 (link to the SBTi website). NetZeroby40 is a carbon emissions roadmap including our base-year results, year-on-year emissions targets, 2030 near-term and our 2040 net zero targets. The plan’s main targets are: Overall net-zero target: • Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2040. Near-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 27.5% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 33.3% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.* Coca- Cola HBC AG commits to no deforestation across its primary deforestation-linked commodities, with a target date of December 31, 2025. * The target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Long-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 90% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 72% by 2040 from a 2019 base year.* * This target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Science-based targets: please see above. Mission 2025 Developed in 2018, Mission 2025 is a set of sustainability commitments based on our stakeholder materiality matrix and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets. It spans across six key focus areas to cover our entire value chain, including emissions reduction, with the following commitments: • Reduce direct carbon emissions ratio by 30% vs 2017. • 50% of our refrigerators in customer outlets will be energy efficient. • 50% of total energy used in our plants will be from renewable and clean sources. • 100% of the total electricity used in our plants in EU and Switzerland will be from renewable and clean source. E1.MDR-T_04 Our recently approved by the SBTi targets for reducing scope 1 and 2 and scope 3 emissions have organisation-wide coverage. We are covering 100% of our operational activities.E1.MDR-T_10 As previously mentioned, our climate change commitments cover our entire Company, all scope 1, 2, 3, and we aim to reach net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040 as per the 1.5 degree scenario, as well as our intermediate emissions reduction target by 2030 is approved by the SBTi. E1.MDR-T_08 The Group’s annual roadmap of net zero target by 2040 is shown in the net zero chart in the strategic part of the IAR, section ‘License to operate’, page 25. Mission 2025 targets related to climate and energy are disclosed in the Strategic Report, ‘Key performance indicators’ section on pages 33 to 34. Those targets don’t have interim targets, but only annual roadmaps at Group level disaggregated further down per BU. E1.MDR-T_09, E1-4_22 At the end of 2020, we set and received approval by the SBTi of our Science-Based Targets by 2030, as our previous SBT period-closing was end of 2020. Those targets are reported in the 2024 IAR (as an old roadmap): Reduction of absolute scope 1, 2 emissions by 55% by 2030 vs 2017 baseline following the 1.5 degree global warming scenario and reduction of scope 3 emissions by 21% by 2030 vs. 2017. So far, we have achieved 31% reduction of our operational emissions vs 2017 (excluding Egypt). Those approved by the SBTi targets are without the integrated new acquisition, Coca-Cola HBC Egypt operations, as its integration happened in 2022, after targets submission and approval in 2021.For the newest targets, approved by the SBTi in December 2024, please refer to previous page (Net Zero targets and FLAG targets). We report as per the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. We are covering 100% of our operational activities. We account and report all seven GHG emissions and report those as equivalent to CO2. Under scope 2 emissions, we are reporting market-based GHG emissions and separately the location-based scope 2 emissions. Our climate targets are also aligned with the UN SDG Target 13.1, i.e. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries, as well as Targets 7.2 and 7.3 on increased renewable energy and energy efficiency. We do not use any carbon removal nor neutralisation or off-setting/insetting methodologies to achieve our GHG internal annual roadmap targets as per the SBTi guidelines. E1.MDR-T_11 The Group sets measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets on material sustainability matters through a structured and inclusive process. Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions are taken, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. The UN SDGs also form a crucial foundation for the Group’s target- setting process, guiding our efforts in addressing global sustainability challenges. Through this comprehensive approach, the Group ensures that its targets are relevant, ambitious and responsive to both stakeholder input and global standards.

"Sustainability Statement continued Our revised roadmap and targets are based on the formally approved by the SBTi in December 2024 net zero target by 2040 and SBT including FLAG by 2030. E1-4_18 Within our recently approved NetZeroby40 targets, we have included all relevant emissions from all our entities from our financial reporting, following the materiality threshold as per the GHG Protocol Standard. We also report 100% of emissions from our joint ventures as there we have operational control. Our NetZeroby40 target was formally approved by the SBTi in December 2024. In 2024 we report as per the old science- based target by 2030, also approved by the SBTi where Egyptian operations are excluded as they were acquired in 2022, after setting the target.

"Sustainability Statement continued commodities, we are proactively collecting deforestation information from all agricultural ingredients suppliers across all our countries in order to have a holistic view of the exposure and potential risk. By the end of 2025, we will have a programme in place to cover any identified gaps. Last but not least, we are in process of implementing a deforestation tracking platform on top of any other activities already in motion, which will also be ready before the end of 2025. E4-1_03, 04, 05 The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has identified five pressures on nature: 1) land/water/sea use change, 2) resource exploitation, 3) climate change, 4) pollution and 5) invasive species. In 2023, we undertook the mapping and materiality assessment on biodiversity across our value chain and we assessed those pressures following the SBTN guideline step 1 and 2. We have collected all our activity data, covering: 1) upstream activities (volumes sourced and origin of raw materials), 2) direct operations (consumption of water and energy of all sites), and 3) downstream (packaging distribution by country). Then we translated the activity data into pressures on nature across five metrics. These pressures on nature were weighted by local nature vulnerability indicators assessing the state of nature in the locations where the activity occurs. Time horizons used in the analysis are as described in E4-1_01. We considered in the assumptions the tighter environmental regulations (e.g., EUDR), carbon pricing policies which would include land conversion activities, deforestation-free commitments from suppliers, and climate risks (e.g., water scarcity, extreme weather events). The result shows that the biggest impact we have is in upstream activities, mainly agricultural suppliers and their impact on land-use change or deforestation. Our procurement strategy to purchase certified raw materials that meet our PSA and our goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chain, support mitigation of the impact and also reduce any potential risk that may occur. E4-1_06 Relevance to stakeholder engagement is described in E4.MDR-T_11. E4-2 Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems E4.MDR-P_01 & E4-2_01, 20 We have adopted policies that address deforestation and sustainable land practices. Our overarching goal for biodiversity is to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Besides, we have set our Environmental Policy, the main objective of which is to minimise the environmental impact of the Group, and the Biodiversity Statement, the objective of which is to enhance biodiversity by reducing emissions and water use, by preserving and reinstating water priority areas, and by sourcing agricultural ingredients sustainably. Moreover, through the Biodiversity Statement, CCHBC is committed to promoting sustainable forest management and helping protect woodlands from deforestation and illegal harvesting. For the monitoring process, please refer to ESRS E1 section, as it constitutes the standard procedure applicable to all relevant topics. Our policies support biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, and responsible sourcing. We are committed to achieving a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas by 2040 and eliminating deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Thus, our policies address ecosystem protection, sustainable forest management, and mitigation of environmental impacts. We recognise the importance of biodiversity for long-term resilience, as our Natural Capital Impact Study and Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVA) help identify key dependencies and risks, while sustainable sourcing practices mitigate transition risks. We implement traceability mechanisms through certifications, verification schemes, and supplier requirements aligned with The Coca-Cola Company’s Principles for Sustainable Agriculture and EcoVadis assessments. Moreover, our policies prioritise collaboration with NGOs, communities, and industry stakeholders to ensure sustainable supply chains that respect human rights, promote responsible land use, and protect natural ecosystems. E4.MDR-P_02 The policies are applicable across all geographies where Coca-Cola HBC operates. Among the affected stakeholder groups, farmers, other suppliers and local communities associated with the Group’s upstream value chain, are most significantly impacted. E4.MDR-P_03 Policies/statements related to environment (including biodiversity) are approved and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors, and they apply to all Coca-Cola HBC employees, regardless of level and function. E4.MDR-P_04 & E4-2_02 In June 2022, we joined the SBTN Corporate Engagement Program. We will continue working to implement the SBTN’s guidance, in order to map and assess the material impacts on biodiversity of our critical commodities and suppliers and then set science-based targets in priority areas. E4.MDR-P_05 We engage with a broad range of stakeholder groups for biodiversity, including our communities, governments, NGOs, investors and suppliers, taking into account their recommendations in the process of setting biodiversity-related policy. For more information, please refer to E1 section. E4.MDR-P_06 The Environmental Policy and the Biodiversity Statement are publicly available at our site (Policies | Coca-Cola HBC), which affected stakeholders can easily access. E4-2_03 The critical areas in our supply chain are defined based on the material dependencies that we have in relation to biodiversity, for example the provision of water, agricultural raw materials and wood. E4-2_04 We started mapping all our operations and critical commodities/suppliers. For our sustainability assessment, we use the risk-based approach with the support of our partners (EcoVadis). Transparency and traceability of material supply chains is established through certifications/ verification schemes or by ensuring suppliers have robust traceability of supply that meets our expectations (please see ‘Supplier Engagement, Verification and Assurance’ from TCCC Principles for Sustainable Agriculture). Also, we regularly measure and report on the progress made against our Mission 2025 commitments, and all other commitments, including those related to biodiversity and deforestation. The annual performance is disclosed in our Annual Report and the GRI Content Index, verified by an independent auditor, and published on our website. E4-2_05, 06, 07, 18 We are committed to sourcing 100% of our key ingredients in line with the Principles for Sustainable Agriculture as set out by TCCC. These principles protect and support biodiversity and ecosystems, uphold human and workplace rights, ensure animal health and welfare, and help build thriving communities. They apply to primary production, i.e., at farm level, and form the basis for our continued engagement with Tier 1 suppliers to ensure sustainable long-term supply at a lower environmental impact. This extends in particular to the sections Conservation of Forests, Conservation of Natural Habitats, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Soil Management and Agrochemical Management.

We took into consideration the best global practices and guidelines such as the SBTN, FAO Good Agricultural Practices, ILO and EU regulations. Targets are monitored quarterly by obtaining information from suppliers for their sustainable certifications. The amount of procured quantity of raw materials certified is divided by the total procured volume for the raw materials in scope. Current status is as per the initial plans. Targets are set for the upstream part of the value chain due to the biggest impact there. E4.MDR-T_10 & E4-4_05 The targets set are in line with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and its mission to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery, and they are aligned with EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy, where the goal for protecting 30% of land in the EU is stated as well as with the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EU DR). E4.MDR-T_11 Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions take place, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Also, during the supplier sustainability events we organise regularly, we discuss different ESG aspects, including biodiversity and deforestation. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. Moreover, we have conducted several meetings with our main sugar and sweeteners suppliers where we discussed environmental topics, among them the deforestation issue.

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E5 – Resource use and circular economy Impact, risk and opportunity management E5-1 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5.MDR-P_01 Packaging plays a vital role in keeping our products fresh and safe. Sustainable packaging and waste management are important to our business, given the amount of packaging we use, the variety of pack materials we use and the need to recover and recycle them after consumption. E5-1_03 & E5-1_04 Beverage packaging has value and life beyond its initial use, and we believe that it should be collected and recycled into a new package as part of a circular economy. To deliver this vision, we own, invest in and take responsibility for collected packaging material as members of authorised recovery organisations. Our commitments E5.MDR-P_01 & E5.MDR-P_04 We are committed to continually improving our environmental performance in the areas of packaging and packaging waste. Since packaging remains critical for us, as already stated through our DMA, and thus we have adopted the ‘Packaging Waste Management Policy’. This policy includes objectives relevant both to packaging materials and packaging waste, and as all our environmental policies, it considers the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and the GRI Standards. E5-1_01 & E5.MDR-P_01 Our Packaging Waste Management Policy commits to collect the equivalent of 75% of our packaging for recycling or reuse by 2025, use 35% recycled PET (rPET) by 2025 in our PET bottles, and in the EU countries, our objective is to reach 50% rPET by 2025. We also are committed to have 100% recyclable by design primary packaging materials and to invest in recycling infrastructure and new technologies that enable increased usage of recycled content in our packaging, where technically and economically feasible. E5-1_03 & E5-1_04 Additionally, for our engagements regarding recyclability and recycled packaging, we have included targets relevant to: • Collection: Recover 75% of our primary packaging for recycling or reuse by 2025. • Eliminate Unnecessary Packaging: Building on the extensive light-weighting programme delivered over the past decade, we will continue to light-weight our primary packaging towards ‘best-in-class‘ bottles and cans in each market, while innovating to remove shrink film from multipacks. • Expand Reusable Packaging: Deliver programmes to increase reusable packaging from 12% of transactions sold in ‘returnable’, and 4% in ‘dispensed,’ formats. • Reduce Virgin Plastic: Through the increased use of circular PET (rPET), light-weighting, removal of plastic film and expansion of reusable packaging formats. • Innovation: Deliver new sustainable packaging solutions through partnerships and R&D. • Inspire and Engage Consumers: Use the power of our brands to encourage consumers to recycle. E5-1_02 & E5.MDR-P_02 Furthermore, under the umbrella of our Biodiversity Statement, as already mentioned in the ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystem, sustainable sourcing of packaging is also taken into account. We aim to source all our paper-based primary packaging materials from sustainable forest sources. All our paper bricks we use are FSC-certified. The scope of our commitments is to improve the circularity of our packaging and to avoid packaging waste, which in turn contributes to better environmental performance. Among the key areas we focus on, and relevant to the materiality analysis, is the circular economy. We take action to improve packaging sustainability, including its recycling into new packages and measuring, evaluating and sharing progress across regions and stakeholders, providing the respective transparency.

"Sustainability Statement continued Sustainable packaging E5.MDR-P_02 & E5.MDR-P_01 We seek to minimise the overall amount of packaging that we use. Together with our suppliers and partners, we are working to design more sustainable packaging and take action to ensure that our packaging doesn’t end up as waste. The big amount of packaging we use for our finished products, if not collected and recycled properly, would end up in the soil, in the rivers and then in the seas and the oceans, which could have a negative impact on ecosystems, human health (toxicity) and society. Packaging waste and climate change are interconnected global challenges, and an area of focus for businesses and communities. 34% of our value chain emissions come from packaging materials, and to achieve our NetZeroby40 emissions goal we invest in sustainable packaging solutions. When we light-weight our packaging, incorporate more recycled and bio-based material, invest in local recycling programmes and increase our use of reusable packaging, we reduce both waste and our GHG emissions. Transparency E5.MDR-P_06 All our policies and commitments are publicly available via our website. By having the policies publicly available, we inform all our stakeholders of our goals and, where needed, we ensure their involvement, as happens with the ‘Packaging Waste Management Policy’, which applies to all Coca-Cola HBC employees, regardless of level and function. All our policies are translated in the local language of our countries and available on their local websites as well. E5.MDR-P_05 Additionally, every year, we perform an annual materiality survey, and we ask more than 500 stakeholders from different stakeholder groups across all our 29 markets and beyond to help us gauge our sustainability agenda and priorities. During our Annual Stakeholder Forums, we discuss the most important ESG areas for our business, and we set actions to improve both our stakeholder engagement and our performance. With suppliers, we have sustainable supply events where we gain their views on how to collaborate in the area of sustainability. Throughout the year, we proactively monitor and take into consideration the requirements by different ESR raters and frameworks; also we perform regular calls with sustainability experts of investors, banks and other financial institutions. E5.MDR-P_03 The Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for establishing the principles governing the Group’s policies on social responsibility and the environment (including packaging waste) to guide management’s decisions and actions. All our policies, such as our Packaging Waste Management Policy, are owned and endorsed by the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. Sustainability SteerCo at ELT level is responsible for developing and implementing policies and executing the strategies to achieve the Company’s social responsibility and environmental goals. Further details regarding our sustainability governance are available in GOV-1 ‘The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies’ and on our website. E5-2 Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy E5.MDR-A_01, 02, 03, 05 & E5-2_08 The objectives from the Packaging Waste Management Policy require continuous improvement and progress. Therefore, each year we strive to improve our performance by establishing new actions and working on the existing ones. Packaging can only be circular if it is recyclable. Since 2022, 100% of our primary packaging – PET, glass, aluminium and aseptic cartons – has been recyclable by design. We achieved this milestone three years ahead of our 2025 target. We are also leading industry efforts to introduce effective and efficient collection systems in all our markets. These include Deposit Return Schemes (DRS) in most of our EU markets. Therefore, we work with governments and industry to create a legal framework in which economic progress and diversion of material from landfill can be achieved. For the reporting year, we focused on different pillars, and we worked with specific focus on each of them. These pillars include: • Recyclability • Recycled packaging • Eliminate unnecessary packaging • Expand reusable (returnable) packaging • Packaging collection Stakeholder engagement E5-2_07 & E5-2_09 For the implementation of all actions, the contribution of our stakeholders was of utmost importance. Collective actions are important when systemic changes are required and we have established strong relationships with our main stakeholders. In December 2024, we welcomed 167 stakeholders, including our suppliers, to our Annual Stakeholder Forum, themed ‘Harnessing a Circular Economy for Packaging’, to explore what actions are needed to help deliver this objective. Additionally, together with our suppliers and partners, we are working to design more sustainable packaging and take action to ensure that our packaging doesn’t end up as waste. Each year, we host a supplier innovation day where we engage with key partners and potential new suppliers in the area of sustainable packaging. Previous to the reporting year, we have piloted and then scaled technologies that now allow us to replace plastic film on multipacks with carton solutions, such as the KeelClipTM roll-out, the cardboard holder for cans multipacks, and process non-food grade ‘hot washed’ PET flakes to produce high-quality food-grade rPET. Furthermore, since 2022, we started an ongoing collaboration with the University of Portsmouth, to investigate the potential commercialisation of technologies and processes for the enzymatic recycling of PET. This co-funded research project is exploring new applications for bio-recycling enzymes that could have the potential to promote packaging circularity at industrial scale. As already stated, in countries where effective collection systems do not exist, we are working together with peers and governments to design and implement new systems. Such cases are our alliance with the Food and Beverage Recycling Alliance (FBRA) in Nigeria and our partnership with the recycler BariQ in Egypt. A new approach to promotional displays has been piloted with our customer Żabka, a large chain of convenience stores in Poland. This new system only requires the customer to change the branding of our products in stores – not the display units themselves. This means that our customer retains a high-quality display, and we save money on transport and production costs. This collaborative initiative created commercial value for us and for our customers while reducing waste and cutting down on CO2 emissions. Lastly, we are members of the European Organisation for Packaging and the Environment – EUROPEN and UNESDA Soft Drinks Europe. EUROPEN is the voice of the packaging supply chain industry in Europe on topics related to packaging and the environment. This membership provides us the opportunity to understand the challenges of the wider packaging supply chain (from producers of packaging all the way to recyclers) and to work with governments and the European Commission around issues. The role of EUROPEN within the circular economy is to: a) continuously improve the environmental performance of packaging and packaged products all along the supply chain; b) promote the role, functionalities and benefits of packaging within all relevant EU policies; and c) achieve a harmonised policy framework and a functioning EU internal market for packaging and packaged products.

"Sustainability Statement continued In 2024, we updated our net zero roadmap with three important changes. We integrated our Egyptian operations into our 2030 and NetZeroby40 climate targets, we added new Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) targets, and we updated our mid-term emissions goal to follow the Well-Below-2-Degrees (WB2D) pathway until 2030 and then the 1.5 degrees pathway until 2040. Due to the FLAG targets requirements, we are moving our baseline year for the mid-term 2030 emissions reduction targets from 2017 to 2019. With all those changes, our NetZeroby40 target was formally validated by the SBTi. As the validation came in December 2024, in 2025 we will work to update the roadmap with all those changes and communicate transparently on our website. E1-3_01,03,04 Table 9: Mitigation actions per decarbonisation lever (action, GHG reductions) The actions per lever consider our updated net zero roadmap as approved by the SBTi in late December 2024.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1-3_07,08, E1-1_04,06,08 As detailed in the EU Taxonomy section of this sustainability statement, our core economic activity is not yet included in the published Delegated Acts and is therefore not considered Taxonomy-eligible at this stage. However, we have assessed secondary activities that contribute to climate change mitigation. In 2024, 0.67% of total Capex was Taxonomy-aligned, also driven by activities connected to our climate transition plan. Specifically, CCM4.25 ‘Production of heat/cool using waste heat’ , CCM7.4 ‘Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings’ and CE1.1 ‘Manufacture of plastic packaging goods’ contributed to aligned Capex. We have also assessed CCM6.5 ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles’, which relates to the electrification of our fleet. Although a significant part of our fleet meets the TSC, due to challenges with the DNSH criteria, we will claim zero alignment to EU Taxonomy in 2024. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain or increase EU Taxonomy alignment as we continue to evaluate investment plans and operational expenditures in areas that could become eligible with the introduction of regulatory updates. Metrics and targets E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation E1.MDR-T_01,02,03,05,06,07, E1-4_01,24 NetZeroby40 Multiple climate scenarios have been taken into consideration, as outlined in SBM-3_08_09_10, helping assess external drivers, including policy developments and market shifts. In October 2021, we announced our NetZeroby40 transition plan, as part of our commitment to reach net zero absolute emissions across all scopes by 2040. This target is fully aligned with the 1.5 degree pathway, and it was approved by the SBTi in December 2024 (link to the SBTi website). NetZeroby40 is a carbon emissions roadmap including our base-year results, year-on-year emissions targets, 2030 near-term and our 2040 net zero targets. The plan’s main targets are: Overall net-zero target: • Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2040. Near-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 27.5% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 33.3% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.* Coca- Cola HBC AG commits to no deforestation across its primary deforestation-linked commodities, with a target date of December 31, 2025. * The target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Long-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 90% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 72% by 2040 from a 2019 base year.* * This target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Science-based targets: please see above. Mission 2025 Developed in 2018, Mission 2025 is a set of sustainability commitments based on our stakeholder materiality matrix and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets. It spans across six key focus areas to cover our entire value chain, including emissions reduction, with the following commitments: • Reduce direct carbon emissions ratio by 30% vs 2017. • 50% of our refrigerators in customer outlets will be energy efficient. • 50% of total energy used in our plants will be from renewable and clean sources. • 100% of the total electricity used in our plants in EU and Switzerland will be from renewable and clean source. E1.MDR-T_04 Our recently approved by the SBTi targets for reducing scope 1 and 2 and scope 3 emissions have organisation-wide coverage. We are covering 100% of our operational activities.E1.MDR-T_10 As previously mentioned, our climate change commitments cover our entire Company, all scope 1, 2, 3, and we aim to reach net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040 as per the 1.5 degree scenario, as well as our intermediate emissions reduction target by 2030 is approved by the SBTi. E1.MDR-T_08 The Group’s annual roadmap of net zero target by 2040 is shown in the net zero chart in the strategic part of the IAR, section ‘License to operate’, page 25. Mission 2025 targets related to climate and energy are disclosed in the Strategic Report, ‘Key performance indicators’ section on pages 33 to 34. Those targets don’t have interim targets, but only annual roadmaps at Group level disaggregated further down per BU. E1.MDR-T_09, E1-4_22 At the end of 2020, we set and received approval by the SBTi of our Science-Based Targets by 2030, as our previous SBT period-closing was end of 2020. Those targets are reported in the 2024 IAR (as an old roadmap): Reduction of absolute scope 1, 2 emissions by 55% by 2030 vs 2017 baseline following the 1.5 degree global warming scenario and reduction of scope 3 emissions by 21% by 2030 vs. 2017. So far, we have achieved 31% reduction of our operational emissions vs 2017 (excluding Egypt). Those approved by the SBTi targets are without the integrated new acquisition, Coca-Cola HBC Egypt operations, as its integration happened in 2022, after targets submission and approval in 2021.For the newest targets, approved by the SBTi in December 2024, please refer to previous page (Net Zero targets and FLAG targets). We report as per the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. We are covering 100% of our operational activities. We account and report all seven GHG emissions and report those as equivalent to CO2. Under scope 2 emissions, we are reporting market-based GHG emissions and separately the location-based scope 2 emissions. Our climate targets are also aligned with the UN SDG Target 13.1, i.e. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries, as well as Targets 7.2 and 7.3 on increased renewable energy and energy efficiency. We do not use any carbon removal nor neutralisation or off-setting/insetting methodologies to achieve our GHG internal annual roadmap targets as per the SBTi guidelines. E1.MDR-T_11 The Group sets measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets on material sustainability matters through a structured and inclusive process. Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions are taken, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. The UN SDGs also form a crucial foundation for the Group’s target- setting process, guiding our efforts in addressing global sustainability challenges. Through this comprehensive approach, the Group ensures that its targets are relevant, ambitious and responsive to both stakeholder input and global standards.

"Sustainability Statement continued Our revised roadmap and targets are based on the formally approved by the SBTi in December 2024 net zero target by 2040 and SBT including FLAG by 2030. E1-4_18 Within our recently approved NetZeroby40 targets, we have included all relevant emissions from all our entities from our financial reporting, following the materiality threshold as per the GHG Protocol Standard. We also report 100% of emissions from our joint ventures as there we have operational control. Our NetZeroby40 target was formally approved by the SBTi in December 2024.

Now 2019 is selected as per the FLAG requirements and considering the most credible data for our Egyptian operations which were acquired in 2022. We follow GHGP, and we have a recalculation policy to recalculate baseline year as required by the GHG Protocol. E1-4_21 The only occasion where we have slightly modified our baseline year was regarding the development of our FLAG targets. To meet the new SBTi recommendation for FLAG targets, that baseline year should not be older than 2018, we had to change our original 2017 baseline to 2019 for compliance purposes.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-A_04 As seen, we have established a comprehensive action plan and implemented several actions related to circular economy and packaging. By those actions, we demonstrate our support to nature and to people independently on whether they are harmed or not. In 2024, no negative incident related to circular economy has been recorded. Financial Resources E5.MDR-A_06, 07, 09, 11 Specifically, to support our actions related to the expansion of reusable/refillable packaging, we make investments every year for the renewal or increase of the returnable containers fleet. In 2024, this investment reached €59 million. We also invested €9.5 million in production infrastructure, mainly for new returnable glass production lines in Italy and Nigeria. In addition, we invest significant amounts to support our action plan around the increase of recycled content in our packaging, specifically by expanding the use of recycled PET. Building on the significant in-house rPET production infrastructure investments we have made in the past few years in Italy, Poland and Romania, we allocated €30 million in 2024 to support the higher cost of recycled PET compared with virgin PET. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our ‘Financial Statements’, in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. Moving ahead, we will continue to support our circular economy action plan as required. Specifically for 2025, we plan to continue our investments in production infrastructure in Italy to support the RGB expansion in the market, and we will allocate significant Capex on returnable containers across our markets. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared with virgin PET will increase further to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target, but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. To support our actions, financial resources must be secured through targeted allocation. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN SDGs and the EU Environmental Objectives. Financing mechanisms include a diverse range of instruments, ensuring flexibility in meeting both current and future financial requirements for action plans. Metrics and targets E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3_01 We have set voluntary targets that promote circular economy, and they are designed to address both resource inflows and outflows, and the lifecycle of products and materials. E5-3_02 Our objective is to keep our primary packaging 100% recyclable by design. Therefore, we have established a target related to circular product design, which is already achieved. We have made our primary packaging 100% fully recyclable three years ahead of the expected timeline and 2025 target. For us, recyclability is calculated as technical recyclability by design, and here we consider all beverage packaging which is made of glass, aluminium/steel, PET and aseptic cartons. All of those are able to be recycled fully. We consider as technical recyclability by design any reuse or recycle option for those materials. In the definition, we do not take into consideration the packaging collection rates in every country. E5-3_03 & E5-3_04 Our resource inflows targets focus on the continuous improvement of recycled material use. They have a double role, since by increasing their recycled content, the rates of primary raw materials decline. The targets refer to the recycled PET used for plastic bottles. Furthermore, we aim to remove an additional 2,800 tonnes of our light-weight packaging by 2025 compared with 2023 data. E5-3_05 & E5-3_09 As already stated, we aim to source all our paper- based primary packaging materials from sustainable forest sources. Now, 100% of our paper bricks (aseptic carton) we use are FSC®-certified. Driven by the materiality results, and focusing on the material topics, our targets address the prevention layer (including the reduction) of the waste hierarchy pyramid, as well as recycling and recovering. Returnable glass bottles address reuse layer of the waste hierarchy. E5.MDR-T_01 The majority of those targets are connected with the Packaging Waste Management Policy and reflect total Group targets. To track our performance and our contribution to the final target, every year we set a yearly target as an annual milestone. E5.MDR-T_12 For our targets we use actual data to report the progress, e.g., for recyclability we use the technical by design data of our primary packaging materials (glass, PET, aluminium/steel can, paper, aseptic paper). Our time horizons could be an annual goal aligned with the Business Planning process (BP), mid-term targets aligned with our long-range plan (LRP) and business objectives, or long-term targets such as NetZeroby40 aligned with the external trends. All those targets, however, are disaggregated to annual roadmaps, and our regular performance review is two-pronged: a) versus the annual roadmap; and b) versus the direction of the target year. On this way, we are able to set actions and correct course if needed. E5-3_01 & E5-3_09 & E5.MDR-T_02 – E5.MDR-T_08 Table 28 below provides further details on each target, including their characteristics (targets’ level, their units, their time-boundaries, the progress made over the baseline measurements), illustrating how they contribute to our overall sustainability goals and circular economy principles.

Purchased goods and services Magnitude/ Materiality to Corporate Carbon emissions inventory 3,017,955 Y Average data method. For emission quantification, we multiply the quantities of purchased materials by the respective ingredients/packaging GHG emissions factors. We use Ecoinvent, World Food Database and IFEU LCA assigned by TCCC among others as the source of emission factors. In the near future, we expect this category emission accounting to move from current method to a hybrid data method and use supplier- specific emissions factor where available and reliable. In 2024, we used specific emission factor for our own in-house produced rPET. The factor was developed based on the LCA prepared by IFEU independent experts. In addition, for our main primary packaging materials, as PET, aluminum for cans, glass for returnable and one-way bottles, we are including in the calculation recycling content of materials used (recycled content comes from our suppliers). In 2024 we enhanced our reporting capability by automating the report of the raw and packaging materials used in production. During this automation process we improved data accuracy. We are looking in the future to split category 3.1.

As per the SBTi guidelines, carbon removal measures are not permitted at this stage. We commenced the purchase of a small amount of carbon removals in 2023 and 2024, we accumulate them but we don’t use them in our carbon inventory as per the SBTi guidelines. At present, we are still gaining knowledge on carbon removals, and we plan to develop a comprehensive removal strategy once the formal guidelines on removals are finalised. E1-7_02 We plan to purchase and cancel carbon credits for neutralisation at the end of our net zero target (2040).

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-A_04 As seen, we have established a comprehensive action plan and implemented several actions related to circular economy and packaging. By those actions, we demonstrate our support to nature and to people independently on whether they are harmed or not. In 2024, no negative incident related to circular economy has been recorded. Financial Resources E5.MDR-A_06, 07, 09, 11 Specifically, to support our actions related to the expansion of reusable/refillable packaging, we make investments every year for the renewal or increase of the returnable containers fleet. In 2024, this investment reached €59 million. We also invested €9.5 million in production infrastructure, mainly for new returnable glass production lines in Italy and Nigeria. In addition, we invest significant amounts to support our action plan around the increase of recycled content in our packaging, specifically by expanding the use of recycled PET. Building on the significant in-house rPET production infrastructure investments we have made in the past few years in Italy, Poland and Romania, we allocated €30 million in 2024 to support the higher cost of recycled PET compared with virgin PET. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our ‘Financial Statements’, in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. Moving ahead, we will continue to support our circular economy action plan as required. Specifically for 2025, we plan to continue our investments in production infrastructure in Italy to support the RGB expansion in the market, and we will allocate significant Capex on returnable containers across our markets. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared with virgin PET will increase further to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target, but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. To support our actions, financial resources must be secured through targeted allocation. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN SDGs and the EU Environmental Objectives.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-T_12 & E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_01 We have not changed any of our targets, as for us any sustainability target means to deliver, to execute – an opposite of an aspirational target. The Single Use Plastics Directive, which was introduced after our 2025 commitments, applies only to EU Member States. However, we have voluntarily extended these commitments to include our other markets, ensuring they reflect our entire value chain. E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_09 The Single Use Plastics Directive imposed in 2019 a 77% separate collection target of PET beverage bottles by 2025 and a recycled content target of 25% in PET beverage bottles. For our collection targets, these were set in 2018, following a previous commitment of 40% total packaging collected by 2020, which we had already overachieved in 2018. For 2025, we have set ambitious targets as an average for all our markets. Not all markets are in the EU, therefore the 75% on average was much more ambitious than the Single Use Plastic Directive or any other local targets. The Single Use Plastic Directive also only defines collection for PET bottles whereas we are going beyond this, including all our primary packaging (such as glass bottles and aluminium cans). For recycled content, this is also above Single Use Plastic Directive targets for 2025. E5.MDR-T_13 We have specialised software to monitor and review for each of our ESG goals/targets, and we report monthly the actual performance and status (if we are on track, lagging behind or partly on track) to the members of the ELT who are accountable for the respective KPIs. The actuals are easily available in our EDGE dashboards. Quarterly, the performance and the related actions to achieve the annual goals are reported to the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. E5.MDR-T_10 & E5.MDR-T_11 We have also involved our stakeholders in the process of target-setting. We use the industry best practices for setting the targets and clearly describe the calculations and methods used in our internal guidebooks. Feedback by NGOs, industry associations such as UNESDA, and suppliers, but also strategic initiatives such as the UN SDGs, are considered. Stakeholder engagement is pivotal, particularly through Annual Stakeholder Forums and frequent meetings with all relevant stakeholders (NGOs, peer companies, customers, municipalities). The insights gathered from these engagements, along with the expectations of ESG raters and investors, inform the setting of ambitious, data-driven targets. E5-3_08 We strive to minimise food loss and food waste in our operations. Our target to tackle food waste and loss across our activities and operations is: to decrease our absolute food losses (in dry matter) by 30% by 2025 compared to our 2019 baseline despite volume growth, an increase in portfolio/beverage categories, and expansion to emerging markets, and further reduce by 40% by 2030 vs 2019. Food loss and waste at our manufacturing sites are part of the overall waste management process. We strive to reach 100% recycled waste and zero waste to landfill in manufacturing. We have reduced the percentage of manufacturing waste going to landfill significantly: in 2024, only 1.6% of our manufacturing waste went to landfill, while in 2015 it was 10.1%. This means in 2024 98.4% of total manufacturing waste was recycled or used for alternative usage.. E5-4 Resource inflows E5-4_01 Resource inflows, relevant to upstream activities and reported within this chapter, take into account the results of the materiality analysis. This analysis has identified packaging inflows as a material topic. Our packaging inflows include different streams of packaging, such as: • Plastic, which is used for plastic bottles, closures, HDPE/LDPE bottles, labels and stretch/shrink films; • Glass, which is used for glass bottles; • Metal, which are used for aluminium cans and metal crowns; and • Paper, which is used for paper labels, composite aseptic carton, cardboard and wood pallets). All data relevant to our packaging inflows quantities that we used during the reporting period is disclosed in the following table.

"Sustainability Statement continued S1.MDR-T_13 How targets are monitored and reviewed We have specialised software for each of our ESG goals/targets, and we report monthly the actual performance and status (if we are on track, lagging or partly on track) to the members of the ELT who are accountable for the respective KPIs. The actuals are easily available in our EDGE dashboards. Quarterly, the performance is reported to the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. At local business unit level, those targets are also reviewed monthly. For each of the targets, we have the same process: setting annual targets for each year by the target year (so-called annual roadmaps), monthly reporting of actuals, monthly performance review and actions set by each owner, quarterly report to the Social Responsibility Committee, annual disclosure in the IAR and on the website. S1-5_01, 02, 03 S1-5_01 Setting a target of zero fatalities and aiming for zero occupational health and safety incidents aligns with the expectations of both employees and external stakeholders, as even a single incident is one too many. Similarly, the goal of having 50% women in leadership positions and striving to achieve a top decile global norm in employee engagement are fully aligned with our employees’ expectations. These targets reflect our commitment to creating a safe and inclusive workplace. S1-5_02 Tracking CCHBC’s performance We conduct regular performance reviews for each of the KPIs used, including the ones for people. During those performance reviews, different levels of the organisation are included. Workers’ representatives are being involved in DEI reviews in local discussions. Group OH&S results are being communicated to all CCH countries via regular Group meetings and routines established with the business units; country results are being communicated via country meetings across the organisation (shift review meetings, plant management and all employees’ meetings, etc.) and are also displayed in specific communication boards across our plants. S1-5_03 Lessons learned or improvements as a result of CCHBC’s performance We have introduced bi-monthly OH&S Lessons learned meetings, where we present selected SIF (Severe Injuries and Fatalities) and SIFp (events, that have potential to become severe injury or fatality – can be LTA or Severe Near Miss). Every second month, we choose a few relevant SIF/SIFp events and they are presented to all our countries. Then each business unit should take proactive action to avoid similar accidents from happening. All documents are then uploaded on an internal platform and shared again with all countries. Also, we perform lessons learned from the major audit findings where the respective country is required to share their actions to improve. We maintain strong collaboration with worker representatives, both at the local level and through the European Works Council (EWC), which holds two select committee meetings and one plenary meeting each year. No issues have been reported in these engagements in 2024. S1-6 – Characteristics of CCHBC’s employees S1-6_01-06 & S1-1_20 Records on recruitment, training and promotion: We use specialised software integrated with our business systems to keep up-to-date and detailed records on recruitment, training and promotion.

We continued to optimise development tools, such as STAY and career conversations, and individual development plan guides. Talent Builders was launched as a programme to support all new people leaders on an end-to-end journey dedicated to the essentials of recruiting, developing and retaining people. We have also focused on our critical growth capabilities, introducing ‘x-ray’ reviews to proactively identify where we need to invest in external hires or internal capability development, which are vital for sustainable business performance and growth. We offer a suite of academies that support professional development of key sales roles. Alongside new Premium Spirits and Coffee Academies, we launched a Digital Commerce Academy and relaunched our Sales Academy for Key Accounts. We also launched MYcroLearnings across all our markets as five-minute bitesize online sessions offered every two weeks to our entire sales force to reinforce foundational and critical elements of sales capabilities. When it comes to investing in our supply chain talent, we launched the Supply Chain Academy to approximately 95% of all supply chain personnel across manufacturing, logistics, quality, planning and procurement. In 2023, we launched our Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Academy, partnering with credible European academia. The programme is long term, continuing in 2024 and 2025.

For this reason, the following policy is applicable to Coca-Cola HBC employees, contractors, visitors and individuals across all our operations and sites (i.e., 100% of CCH people working in our premises are covered, including contractors working in our premises). We deliver our OH&S policy programme through a structured implementation of the occupational health and safety management system ISO 45001. Adjustments for disabilities: in every office and manufacturing plant we have facilities adjusted for people with disabilities, such as ramps, lifts and toilets. We have established several Healthy working environment initiatives focusing on ergonomic workplace, illumination, noise, indoor air quality and humidity. For each of these, specific design requirements are described in our Engineering Specifications, and regular trainings are offered to the employees (e.g., via specific Toolbox Talks).

"Sustainability Statement continued Strategy SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model S2.SBM-3_01, 02, 03, 05, 06 At CCHBC, all value chain workers who may be materially impacted by our operations are included in the scope of disclosures under ESRS 2. This encompasses addressing impacts linked to our own operations and value chain, including those arising from our products, services and business relationships. We specifically report on key areas such as secure employment, adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality, equal pay for work of equal value, and training and skills development. Types of value chain workers We consider value chain workers, workers working on our sites, but who are not part of own workforce, i.e., who are not self-employed workers or workers provided by third-party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities. In essence: • They are outsourced to a separate company that manages its own staff; • Coca-Cola HBC does not directly control the workers; instead, it has a business relationship with the service provider; • The responsibility for managing and employing the workers lies with the service provider, even if the work is performed at CCHBC’s premises; • The external service provide retains responsibility for hiring, managing and supervising, and CCHBC has a business relationship with the service provider, not the individual workers. Examples include pickers and forklift drivers in our warehouses, workers sorting our empty reusable bottles at our plant facilities, cleaning services workers and workers working at our wastewater treatment facilities in the plants and drivers of the delivery trucks by our outsourced logistics. We also consider value chain workers, a variety of workers in the supply base that execute various activities either in an office context or within the agricultural sector and industrial sectors. Our supply base focus is Tier 1 suppliers and aspire to cover for the Tier 2 or below suppliers through the Supplier’s commitment on SGPs or PSA in the case of agricultural ingredients. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of vendors must acknowledge acceptance of CCH SGPs before they can proceed to work with us across sectors and sourcing categories and are monitored on compliance through various tools depending on complexity and criticality of their operations. Specifically, the Strategic Group Suppliers, we actively ask them to confirm ESG compliance including social and human rights attributes, for their critical supply base, i.e. T2 layer or below for CCH. This equally includes white and blue collar works across industries. Specifically for agricultural suppliers, we aspire to cover 100% of our supply base through PSA certifications provided by third-party specialists, which are specifically covering through audits, the practices of farmers and their positioning towards workers of the land such as SAI FSA, ISCC Plus, BONSUCRO, REDcert2, Rainforest Alliance, FairTrade International, Global GAP+GRASP, Global GAP+FSA Add-On, UNILEVER SAC, etc. Our negative effect We have no widespread or systemic material negative impacts on value chain workers in contexts where we operate. Regardless of the high occupational health and safety standards we require by our contractors and service providers, we still report lost time accidents which is the reason to consider negative impact there. Any occupational health and safety incidents are individual. One value chain worker’s fatality was reported in 2024. The contractor lost-time incidents frequency rate (LTIFR) in 2024 is decreasing to 1.31 compared to 1.72 in 2023.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-A_04 As seen, we have established a comprehensive action plan and implemented several actions related to circular economy and packaging. By those actions, we demonstrate our support to nature and to people independently on whether they are harmed or not. In 2024, no negative incident related to circular economy has been recorded. Financial Resources E5.MDR-A_06, 07, 09, 11 Specifically, to support our actions related to the expansion of reusable/refillable packaging, we make investments every year for the renewal or increase of the returnable containers fleet. In 2024, this investment reached €59 million. We also invested €9.5 million in production infrastructure, mainly for new returnable glass production lines in Italy and Nigeria. In addition, we invest significant amounts to support our action plan around the increase of recycled content in our packaging, specifically by expanding the use of recycled PET. Building on the significant in-house rPET production infrastructure investments we have made in the past few years in Italy, Poland and Romania, we allocated €30 million in 2024 to support the higher cost of recycled PET compared with virgin PET. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our ‘Financial Statements’, in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. Moving ahead, we will continue to support our circular economy action plan as required. Specifically for 2025, we plan to continue our investments in production infrastructure in Italy to support the RGB expansion in the market, and we will allocate significant Capex on returnable containers across our markets. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared with virgin PET will increase further to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target, but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. To support our actions, financial resources must be secured through targeted allocation. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN SDGs and the EU Environmental Objectives. Financing mechanisms include a diverse range of instruments, ensuring flexibility in meeting both current and future financial requirements for action plans. Metrics and targets E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3_01 We have set voluntary targets that promote circular economy, and they are designed to address both resource inflows and outflows, and the lifecycle of products and materials. E5-3_02 Our objective is to keep our primary packaging 100% recyclable by design. Therefore, we have established a target related to circular product design, which is already achieved. We have made our primary packaging 100% fully recyclable three years ahead of the expected timeline and 2025 target. For us, recyclability is calculated as technical recyclability by design, and here we consider all beverage packaging which is made of glass, aluminium/steel, PET and aseptic cartons. All of those are able to be recycled fully. We consider as technical recyclability by design any reuse or recycle option for those materials. In the definition, we do not take into consideration the packaging collection rates in every country. E5-3_03 & E5-3_04 Our resource inflows targets focus on the continuous improvement of recycled material use. They have a double role, since by increasing their recycled content, the rates of primary raw materials decline. The targets refer to the recycled PET used for plastic bottles. Furthermore, we aim to remove an additional 2,800 tonnes of our light-weight packaging by 2025 compared with 2023 data. E5-3_05 & E5-3_09 As already stated, we aim to source all our paper- based primary packaging materials from sustainable forest sources. Now, 100% of our paper bricks (aseptic carton) we use are FSC®-certified. Driven by the materiality results, and focusing on the material topics, our targets address the prevention layer (including the reduction) of the waste hierarchy pyramid, as well as recycling and recovering. Returnable glass bottles address reuse layer of the waste hierarchy. E5.MDR-T_01 The majority of those targets are connected with the Packaging Waste Management Policy and reflect total Group targets. To track our performance and our contribution to the final target, every year we set a yearly target as an annual milestone. E5.MDR-T_12 For our targets we use actual data to report the progress, e.g., for recyclability we use the technical by design data of our primary packaging materials (glass, PET, aluminium/steel can, paper, aseptic paper). Our time horizons could be an annual goal aligned with the Business Planning process (BP), mid-term targets aligned with our long-range plan (LRP) and business objectives, or long-term targets such as NetZeroby40 aligned with the external trends. All those targets, however, are disaggregated to annual roadmaps, and our regular performance review is two-pronged: a) versus the annual roadmap; and b) versus the direction of the target year. On this way, we are able to set actions and correct course if needed. E5-3_01 & E5-3_09 & E5.MDR-T_02 – E5.MDR-T_08 Table 28 below provides further details on each target, including their characteristics (targets’ level, their units, their time-boundaries, the progress made over the baseline measurements), illustrating how they contribute to our overall sustainability goals and circular economy principles.

E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_09 The Single Use Plastics Directive imposed in 2019 a 77% separate collection target of PET beverage bottles by 2025 and a recycled content target of 25% in PET beverage bottles. For our collection targets, these were set in 2018, following a previous commitment of 40% total packaging collected by 2020, which we had already overachieved in 2018. For 2025, we have set ambitious targets as an average for all our markets. Not all markets are in the EU, therefore the 75% on average was much more ambitious than the Single Use Plastic Directive or any other local targets. The Single Use Plastic Directive also only defines collection for PET bottles whereas we are going beyond this, including all our primary packaging (such as glass bottles and aluminium cans). For recycled content, this is also above Single Use Plastic Directive targets for 2025. E5.MDR-T_13 We have specialised software to monitor and review for each of our ESG goals/targets, and we report monthly the actual performance and status (if we are on track, lagging behind or partly on track) to the members of the ELT who are accountable for the respective KPIs. The actuals are easily available in our EDGE dashboards. Quarterly, the performance and the related actions to achieve the annual goals are reported to the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. E5.MDR-T_10 & E5.MDR-T_11 We have also involved our stakeholders in the process of target-setting. We use the industry best practices for setting the targets and clearly describe the calculations and methods used in our internal guidebooks. Feedback by NGOs, industry associations such as UNESDA, and suppliers, but also strategic initiatives such as the UN SDGs, are considered. Stakeholder engagement is pivotal, particularly through Annual Stakeholder Forums and frequent meetings with all relevant stakeholders (NGOs, peer companies, customers, municipalities). The insights gathered from these engagements, along with the expectations of ESG raters and investors, inform the setting of ambitious, data-driven targets. E5-3_08 We strive to minimise food loss and food waste in our operations. Our target to tackle food waste and loss across our activities and operations is: to decrease our absolute food losses (in dry matter) by 30% by 2025 compared to our 2019 baseline despite volume growth, an increase in portfolio/beverage categories, and expansion to emerging markets, and further reduce by 40% by 2030 vs 2019. Food loss and waste at our manufacturing sites are part of the overall waste management process. We strive to reach 100% recycled waste and zero waste to landfill in manufacturing. We have reduced the percentage of manufacturing waste going to landfill significantly: in 2024, only 1.6% of our manufacturing waste went to landfill, while in 2015 it was 10.1%. This means in 2024 98.4% of total manufacturing waste was recycled or used for alternative usage.. E5-4 Resource inflows E5-4_01 Resource inflows, relevant to upstream activities and reported within this chapter, take into account the results of the materiality analysis. This analysis has identified packaging inflows as a material topic. Our packaging inflows include different streams of packaging, such as: • Plastic, which is used for plastic bottles, closures, HDPE/LDPE bottles, labels and stretch/shrink films; • Glass, which is used for glass bottles; • Metal, which are used for aluminium cans and metal crowns; and • Paper, which is used for paper labels, composite aseptic carton, cardboard and wood pallets). All data relevant to our packaging inflows quantities that we used during the reporting period is disclosed in the following table.

The data is based on the purchased volume we use either for the manufacturing of our packaging (only in the in-house rPET plants) or for the packaging which is being supplied from external suppliers. The data relevant to recycled content for the packaging is based on our suppliers’ data, and then we calculate the weighted average based on the amount purchased by each of those suppliers. E5-4_08 We ensure that there is no overlap or double counting between the categories of reused and recycled materials. Reusable glass bottles are reported only with the new number of bottles purchased in the respective year. We have invoices and number of purchasing orders with the respective amount purchased for all materials that are entering in our plants. In our systems, we have master data of each material which is part of the product recipe, meaning that for each of our produced products, we know how much material we have used. The same for resource outflows – we know the exact amount of every ingredient and packaging material used in any sold products. Reusable packaging is not reported to the Packaging Recovery Organisations (PROs) for the floating volumes (i.e., all the bottles in circulation). We report only the new quantities of bottles purchased each year. This approach assumes that new bottle purchases are not solely due to increased volume but also because some reusable bottles were not collected and ended up in the recycling stream. Additionally, once reusable bottles reach the end of their lifespan, they will eventually become waste and be recycled. So, we avoid double counting by only reporting to the PROs the new quantities purchased each year, and not the whole floating (or in circulation) volume related to reusable/refillable glass bottles. E5-5 Resource outflows Outflows Resource outflows are another material topic for us. E5-5_01 We are committed to incorporate more circular principles in our production processes, and for that purpose we have implemented key actions and innovations. Now, five of our water brands are sold in 100% rPET bottles: Romerquelle (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia), Deep RiverRock (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland), Valser (Switzerland), Dorna (Romania) and Natura (Czech Republic and Slovakia). Switzerland was also our first country to move its entire locally produced PET portfolio to 100% rPET. This was followed by Italy1 and Austria, and in 2023, Romania, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland also transitioned to 100% rPET for the locally produced PET portfolio. In addition, since 2023, Romania successfully combined a 100% rPET local bottle portfolio, an in-house rPET facility and a Deposit Return Scheme, helping us close the loop for plastic packaging circularity. We continue our use of recycled shrink film in Ireland, where our Deep RiverRock water multipacks are packaged in Reborn®, a fully recycled plastic film made from post-industrial and post-consumer waste. We are exploring opportunities to launch Reborn® in other markets. Our corrugated cardboard packaging in Europe contains >80% recycled content, while our composite paper carton packs, KeelClipTM, Qflex and LitePac Top, are 100% FSC-certified.

We continued to optimise development tools, such as STAY and career conversations, and individual development plan guides. Talent Builders was launched as a programme to support all new people leaders on an end-to-end journey dedicated to the essentials of recruiting, developing and retaining people. We have also focused on our critical growth capabilities, introducing ‘x-ray’ reviews to proactively identify where we need to invest in external hires or internal capability development, which are vital for sustainable business performance and growth. We offer a suite of academies that support professional development of key sales roles. Alongside new Premium Spirits and Coffee Academies, we launched a Digital Commerce Academy and relaunched our Sales Academy for Key Accounts. We also launched MYcroLearnings across all our markets as five-minute bitesize online sessions offered every two weeks to our entire sales force to reinforce foundational and critical elements of sales capabilities. When it comes to investing in our supply chain talent, we launched the Supply Chain Academy to approximately 95% of all supply chain personnel across manufacturing, logistics, quality, planning and procurement. In 2023, we launched our Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Academy, partnering with credible European academia. The programme is long term, continuing in 2024 and 2025.

"Sustainability Statement continued Strategy SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model S2.SBM-3_01, 02, 03, 05, 06 At CCHBC, all value chain workers who may be materially impacted by our operations are included in the scope of disclosures under ESRS 2. This encompasses addressing impacts linked to our own operations and value chain, including those arising from our products, services and business relationships. We specifically report on key areas such as secure employment, adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality, equal pay for work of equal value, and training and skills development. Types of value chain workers We consider value chain workers, workers working on our sites, but who are not part of own workforce, i.e., who are not self-employed workers or workers provided by third-party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities. In essence: • They are outsourced to a separate company that manages its own staff; • Coca-Cola HBC does not directly control the workers; instead, it has a business relationship with the service provider; • The responsibility for managing and employing the workers lies with the service provider, even if the work is performed at CCHBC’s premises; • The external service provide retains responsibility for hiring, managing and supervising, and CCHBC has a business relationship with the service provider, not the individual workers. Examples include pickers and forklift drivers in our warehouses, workers sorting our empty reusable bottles at our plant facilities, cleaning services workers and workers working at our wastewater treatment facilities in the plants and drivers of the delivery trucks by our outsourced logistics. We also consider value chain workers, a variety of workers in the supply base that execute various activities either in an office context or within the agricultural sector and industrial sectors. Our supply base focus is Tier 1 suppliers and aspire to cover for the Tier 2 or below suppliers through the Supplier’s commitment on SGPs or PSA in the case of agricultural ingredients. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of vendors must acknowledge acceptance of CCH SGPs before they can proceed to work with us across sectors and sourcing categories and are monitored on compliance through various tools depending on complexity and criticality of their operations. Specifically, the Strategic Group Suppliers, we actively ask them to confirm ESG compliance including social and human rights attributes, for their critical supply base, i.e. T2 layer or below for CCH. This equally includes white and blue collar works across industries. Specifically for agricultural suppliers, we aspire to cover 100% of our supply base through PSA certifications provided by third-party specialists, which are specifically covering through audits, the practices of farmers and their positioning towards workers of the land such as SAI FSA, ISCC Plus, BONSUCRO, REDcert2, Rainforest Alliance, FairTrade International, Global GAP+GRASP, Global GAP+FSA Add-On, UNILEVER SAC, etc. Our negative effect We have no widespread or systemic material negative impacts on value chain workers in contexts where we operate. Regardless of the high occupational health and safety standards we require by our contractors and service providers, we still report lost time accidents which is the reason to consider negative impact there. Any occupational health and safety incidents are individual. One value chain worker’s fatality was reported in 2024. The contractor lost-time incidents frequency rate (LTIFR) in 2024 is decreasing to 1.31 compared to 1.72 in 2023.

"Sustainability Statement continued Brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts In general People who are considered as value chain workers, such as staff of third-party service providers, (e.g., for security or canteens), who work at our facilities are part of our OH&S, Food Safety, including WASH (clean water and sanitation) access, and Environmental programmes. In addition, they are included in all our Workplace Accountability audits, which are conducted through an internationally recognised and accredited auditing organisation. The audits specifically cover third-party contracted labour in our premises. Third-party logistics workers (warehouse, transport and distribution) are also mandated to follow our quality, health and safety and environmental standards. At CCHBC, we have a robust programme in place to annually review every year the risks and performance of all our suppliers against our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), Water Risk Assessment, as well as other equally important aspects with impact on our business, such as supply risk and financial stability. Sustainability is a key criterion in supplier selection under strategic sourcing, as well as a criterion for the Annual Supplier Review process that we conduct cross-functionally for critical supply base. To ensure that suppliers demonstrate ESG requirements compliance, we rely in multiple screening and assessment practices that offer us a holistic view of their performance, leveraging multiple tools depending on Supplier categorisation, criticality and impact to our business. The Sustainable Agriculture programme secures ESG monitoring through PSA certification process of the Coca- Cola System across all agricultural commodities. For the remaining supply base, we have designed a robust assessment journey leveraging ESG physical audits, as well as a number of globally recognised screening and assessment tools, such as EcoVadis IQ Plus, EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX, Supply Based Assessment executed by specialist consultants for Group Critical suppliers, WWF Water Risk Filter Assessment, Resilinc Event Watch, Exiger and Moody’s Analytics. One of our Mission 2025 commitments is to ensure that 100% of our key agricultural ingredients (sugar, high fructose starch syrup (HFSS) and Juices fruit crops) are certified by third-party organisations that specialise in agricultural practices providing trainings and implementing audit to secure appropriate implementation of our standards. For full compliance with our PSA, we require our agricultural suppliers to be assessed and certified in accordance with third-party standards, depending on the relevant ingredient. For a comprehensive list of standards, please refer at the text above ‘Types of value chain workers’. Furthermore, ingredient and packaging suppliers must meet GFSI recognised standards, and Tier 1 suppliers are prompted to comply with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45000 as applicable depending on their industry specifics, as well as impact and criticality to our business. Finally, we target over 95% of our procurement addressable spending to be on local suppliers in our countries of operation (local sourcing). In 2024, we had 97.7% sourced locally representing around €5.3 billion (excluding concentrate supplies) of procurement addressable spend. Supply within European Union we define as local to EU countries. Through our socio-economic impact studies (SEIS), we evaluate the direct, indirect and induced impact we have from suppliers to our trade partners and our contribution is significant, especially in emerging markets. The latest SEIS shows that every direct job in our system leads to 13 jobs in the value chain, and in many of the countries where we operate, our contribution to the beverage industry is significant. For the supplier workforce, we secure equal access employment, adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development through the application and compliance tracking of the supplier SGPs and PSAs. Workers in the value chain are supported with training and capability building programmes offered by supplier organisations and Coca-Cola HBC to develop understanding of the sustainability elements and positive impacts and are supported to operate in a new innovative manner that secures smooth transition to climate-neutral operations without the loss of jobs. This is a journey of transition that takes time, but we work with our most significant suppliers to support and record improvement. Gradually jobs are transformed to support the new models and secured at a minimum, while in many cases we detect the creation of new positions and opportunities by supplier organisations to support the climate transition. Access to education Since 2023, we have established annual trainings delivered both to our buyers and our significant suppliers on various topics, including ESG requirements, actions to improve ESG scoring, the importance of sustainability, the EcoVadis Assessments, deforestation, modern slavery and GHG emissions. For strategic suppliers, we aim to recruit them all under the EcoVadis Assessment Platform to track ESG overall performance and, with the support of the EcoVadis team, we promote the use of the EcoVadis Academy to help vendors build better knowledge of important ESG elements. We place specific focus on developing GHG performance tracking for our supply base, starting with a pilot programme for the development of supplier-specific emission factors (SSEFs) with our most sustainably mature suppliers that is now planned to be expanded within 2025 to a much broader supply base. For less mature suppliers, since 2022 we have been working with Guidehouse on capacity building programmes, offering training through the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (SLoCT) programme annually. This initiative helps our less mature suppliers build a strong foundation to start reducing GHG emissions. In November 2023, we held our second Virtual Supplier Sustainability Event, ‘Opening up a more sustainable future together’, where we invited all our Group critical suppliers to discuss emissions reduction, biodiversity and deforestation. Over 400 participants from nearly 200 suppliers, Coca-Cola System colleagues, and trade partners attended our virtual Supplier Day conference. Our partners, CDP and the World Economic Forum, provided expert guidance, tools and tips for suppliers on climate action. Additionally, our suppliers Nordzucker, Ball Corporation and Graphic Packaging International shared their sustainability progress. In 2024, we expanded upon this initiative, engaging with our key suppliers on GHG performance. Through this engagement we have begun developing emissions glidepaths to enhance supplier emissions performance, aiming to meet our scope 3 targets. For more information about Annual stakeholder forum please refer to SBM-2_05, 06. Read more Contribution to employment Please see S1. SBM-3_01-04, 06, 11 (Contribution to Employment Accessibility to a living wage We expect our suppliers to compensate their employees fairly and competitively within their industry, fully complying with applicable local and national wage and hour laws. Additionally, we encourage our suppliers to provide opportunities for employees to develop their skills and capabilities, and to adhere to the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value.

"Sustainability Statement continued We aspire to secure correct practices towards supplier workers through the SGPs and PSA implementation. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of our suppliers are obliged to acknowledge and agree to the SGPs before obtaining the right to do business with us, while we apply different monitoring tools to track compliance depending on supplier category and impact to our business ranging from ESG performance tracking by means of tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus all the way to full scale assessments such as EcoVadis Assessment, SEDEX and SGP physical audits. On agricultural level, we leverage our third-party specialists to conduct audits against the PSA principles, that are covering in an extensive manner all rules and requirements to secure farmer workers. Provision of social protection and social security Contractors who work on our premises are included in our programmes and workplace accountability audits, conducted within a three-year audit cycle. During these audits, they are assessed on human rights, and compliance with local minimum wage laws is verified by an external company. The workplace accountability audits cover various areas, including laws and regulations, wages and benefits, working hours and overtime, business Integrity, work environment, health and safety, environmental practices and demonstration of compliance. Occupational Health and Safety In the context of our implementation of Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001), we take actions which have in scope value chain workers. We implement health and safety programmes, including Behavioural Based Safety and Life Saving Rules: • We enhanced our behaviour-based safety programme by embedding more human and operational principles across manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations. • We ensured Life Saving Rules are in place and incorporated in our cross-country verification programme. We conducted quarterly assessments of all manufacturing and non- manufacturing facilities. Based on these assessments, each country has developed its own corrective actions to address critical gaps and achieve full compliance. Value chain workers in greater risk of harm The service provided workers performing a job at our premises are part of the same rigorous hazardous analysis related to the occupational health and safety, as our employees, e.g., confined space work, work at height, electrical work, etc. Based on those analysis and based on the external occupational health and safety guidelines, we know the jobs that potentially can lead to severe OH&S incidents and thus we set up specific measures to mitigate the potential risks and avoid the incident to happen. Impact, risk and opportunity management S2-1 Policies related to value chain workers S2.MDR-P_01-06 & S2-1_06 The relevant policies adopted to manage material sustainability matters include our Occupational Health and Safety Policy and Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), as well as our Supplier Guiding Principles, which have been adopted as part of ongoing effort to develop and strengthen our relationships with our direct suppliers. These policies cover all types of value chain workers mentioned in the previous section. Occupational Health and Safety Policy Please see S1.MDR-P_01-06 & S1-1_01, 02, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21 Supplier Guiding Principles Key contents of the policy The ‘Supplier Guiding Principles’ includes expectations regarding CCHBC’s suppliers to: • judge their employees and contractors based upon their ability to do their jobs and not upon their physical and/or personal characteristics or beliefs, affirming the principle of no discrimination based on race, colour, gender, age, religion, political opinion, national origin or sexual orientation; • provide a safe workplace with policies and practices in place to minimise the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks; • compensate their employees fairly and competitively relative to their industry, in full compliance with applicable local and national wage and hour laws, and to offer opportunities for employees to develop their skills and capabilities, and to follow the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. Objective Through this policy, we seek to develop relationships with suppliers that share similar values and conduct business in an ethical manner. Process for monitoring Regarding the process for monitoring this policy, in Coca-Cola HBC 100% of our supplier are obliged to acknowledge and agree to the SGPs before obtaining the right to do business with us, while we apply different monitoring tools to track compliance depending on supplier category and impact to our business. To this purpose we use various tools, ranging from EcoVadis IQ Plus all the way to full scale assessments such SGP physical audits, SEDEX and EcoVadis Assessment. We collaborate with TCCC, which routinely utilises independent third parties to assess suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles. The assessments include confidential interviews with employees and on-site contract workers. Scope As part of ongoing efforts to develop and strengthen our relationships with suppliers, we have adopted these Supplier Guiding Principles for use with our direct suppliers. Most senior level accountable for the implementation of the policy Each sustainability policy is approved by the CEO and the ELT and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board. The Chief Supply Chain Officer and Chief Procurement Officer are accountable for the implementation of the policy. Commitment to respect third-party standards We commit through the implementation of Supplier Guiding Principles to respect applicable laws and standards with respect to their operations (e.g., ILO Standards, etc.) Consideration given to the interests of key stakeholders in setting the policy In developing the SGP, we have considered international standards such as ISO 14001, ISO 45000, the ILO and the UN Principles. We have also considered the requirements of investors and ESG raters such as S&P Global, MSCI ESG and CDP as well as the practices of peer companies who are part of UNESDA and BIER (Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable). Additionally, we have incorporated good practices recommended by NGOs such as WWF, and input from our suppliers. Policy available to potentially affected stakeholders All policies are available on our website. At business unit level, they are translated and, additionally, suppliers are mandated to sign our SGP, which is included as part of our contracts.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-A_04 As seen, we have established a comprehensive action plan and implemented several actions related to circular economy and packaging. By those actions, we demonstrate our support to nature and to people independently on whether they are harmed or not. In 2024, no negative incident related to circular economy has been recorded. Financial Resources E5.MDR-A_06, 07, 09, 11 Specifically, to support our actions related to the expansion of reusable/refillable packaging, we make investments every year for the renewal or increase of the returnable containers fleet. In 2024, this investment reached €59 million. We also invested €9.5 million in production infrastructure, mainly for new returnable glass production lines in Italy and Nigeria. In addition, we invest significant amounts to support our action plan around the increase of recycled content in our packaging, specifically by expanding the use of recycled PET. Building on the significant in-house rPET production infrastructure investments we have made in the past few years in Italy, Poland and Romania, we allocated €30 million in 2024 to support the higher cost of recycled PET compared with virgin PET. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our ‘Financial Statements’, in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. Moving ahead, we will continue to support our circular economy action plan as required. Specifically for 2025, we plan to continue our investments in production infrastructure in Italy to support the RGB expansion in the market, and we will allocate significant Capex on returnable containers across our markets. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared with virgin PET will increase further to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target, but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. To support our actions, financial resources must be secured through targeted allocation. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN SDGs and the EU Environmental Objectives. Financing mechanisms include a diverse range of instruments, ensuring flexibility in meeting both current and future financial requirements for action plans. Metrics and targets E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3_01 We have set voluntary targets that promote circular economy, and they are designed to address both resource inflows and outflows, and the lifecycle of products and materials. E5-3_02 Our objective is to keep our primary packaging 100% recyclable by design. Therefore, we have established a target related to circular product design, which is already achieved. We have made our primary packaging 100% fully recyclable three years ahead of the expected timeline and 2025 target. For us, recyclability is calculated as technical recyclability by design, and here we consider all beverage packaging which is made of glass, aluminium/steel, PET and aseptic cartons. All of those are able to be recycled fully. We consider as technical recyclability by design any reuse or recycle option for those materials. In the definition, we do not take into consideration the packaging collection rates in every country. E5-3_03 & E5-3_04 Our resource inflows targets focus on the continuous improvement of recycled material use. They have a double role, since by increasing their recycled content, the rates of primary raw materials decline. The targets refer to the recycled PET used for plastic bottles. Furthermore, we aim to remove an additional 2,800 tonnes of our light-weight packaging by 2025 compared with 2023 data. E5-3_05 & E5-3_09 As already stated, we aim to source all our paper- based primary packaging materials from sustainable forest sources. Now, 100% of our paper bricks (aseptic carton) we use are FSC®-certified. Driven by the materiality results, and focusing on the material topics, our targets address the prevention layer (including the reduction) of the waste hierarchy pyramid, as well as recycling and recovering. Returnable glass bottles address reuse layer of the waste hierarchy. E5.MDR-T_01 The majority of those targets are connected with the Packaging Waste Management Policy and reflect total Group targets. To track our performance and our contribution to the final target, every year we set a yearly target as an annual milestone. E5.MDR-T_12 For our targets we use actual data to report the progress, e.g., for recyclability we use the technical by design data of our primary packaging materials (glass, PET, aluminium/steel can, paper, aseptic paper). Our time horizons could be an annual goal aligned with the Business Planning process (BP), mid-term targets aligned with our long-range plan (LRP) and business objectives, or long-term targets such as NetZeroby40 aligned with the external trends. All those targets, however, are disaggregated to annual roadmaps, and our regular performance review is two-pronged: a) versus the annual roadmap; and b) versus the direction of the target year. On this way, we are able to set actions and correct course if needed. E5-3_01 & E5-3_09 & E5.MDR-T_02 – E5.MDR-T_08 Table 28 below provides further details on each target, including their characteristics (targets’ level, their units, their time-boundaries, the progress made over the baseline measurements), illustrating how they contribute to our overall sustainability goals and circular economy principles.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-T_12 & E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_01 We have not changed any of our targets, as for us any sustainability target means to deliver, to execute – an opposite of an aspirational target. The Single Use Plastics Directive, which was introduced after our 2025 commitments, applies only to EU Member States. However, we have voluntarily extended these commitments to include our other markets, ensuring they reflect our entire value chain. E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_09 The Single Use Plastics Directive imposed in 2019 a 77% separate collection target of PET beverage bottles by 2025 and a recycled content target of 25% in PET beverage bottles. For our collection targets, these were set in 2018, following a previous commitment of 40% total packaging collected by 2020, which we had already overachieved in 2018. For 2025, we have set ambitious targets as an average for all our markets. Not all markets are in the EU, therefore the 75% on average was much more ambitious than the Single Use Plastic Directive or any other local targets. The Single Use Plastic Directive also only defines collection for PET bottles whereas we are going beyond this, including all our primary packaging (such as glass bottles and aluminium cans). For recycled content, this is also above Single Use Plastic Directive targets for 2025. E5.MDR-T_13 We have specialised software to monitor and review for each of our ESG goals/targets, and we report monthly the actual performance and status (if we are on track, lagging behind or partly on track) to the members of the ELT who are accountable for the respective KPIs. The actuals are easily available in our EDGE dashboards. Quarterly, the performance and the related actions to achieve the annual goals are reported to the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. E5.MDR-T_10 & E5.MDR-T_11 We have also involved our stakeholders in the process of target-setting. We use the industry best practices for setting the targets and clearly describe the calculations and methods used in our internal guidebooks. Feedback by NGOs, industry associations such as UNESDA, and suppliers, but also strategic initiatives such as the UN SDGs, are considered. Stakeholder engagement is pivotal, particularly through Annual Stakeholder Forums and frequent meetings with all relevant stakeholders (NGOs, peer companies, customers, municipalities). The insights gathered from these engagements, along with the expectations of ESG raters and investors, inform the setting of ambitious, data-driven targets. E5-3_08 We strive to minimise food loss and food waste in our operations. Our target to tackle food waste and loss across our activities and operations is: to decrease our absolute food losses (in dry matter) by 30% by 2025 compared to our 2019 baseline despite volume growth, an increase in portfolio/beverage categories, and expansion to emerging markets, and further reduce by 40% by 2030 vs 2019. Food loss and waste at our manufacturing sites are part of the overall waste management process. We strive to reach 100% recycled waste and zero waste to landfill in manufacturing. We have reduced the percentage of manufacturing waste going to landfill significantly: in 2024, only 1.6% of our manufacturing waste went to landfill, while in 2015 it was 10.1%. This means in 2024 98.4% of total manufacturing waste was recycled or used for alternative usage.. E5-4 Resource inflows E5-4_01 Resource inflows, relevant to upstream activities and reported within this chapter, take into account the results of the materiality analysis. This analysis has identified packaging inflows as a material topic. Our packaging inflows include different streams of packaging, such as: • Plastic, which is used for plastic bottles, closures, HDPE/LDPE bottles, labels and stretch/shrink films; • Glass, which is used for glass bottles; • Metal, which are used for aluminium cans and metal crowns; and • Paper, which is used for paper labels, composite aseptic carton, cardboard and wood pallets). All data relevant to our packaging inflows quantities that we used during the reporting period is disclosed in the following table.

The data is based on the purchased volume we use either for the manufacturing of our packaging (only in the in-house rPET plants) or for the packaging which is being supplied from external suppliers. The data relevant to recycled content for the packaging is based on our suppliers’ data, and then we calculate the weighted average based on the amount purchased by each of those suppliers. E5-4_08 We ensure that there is no overlap or double counting between the categories of reused and recycled materials. Reusable glass bottles are reported only with the new number of bottles purchased in the respective year. We have invoices and number of purchasing orders with the respective amount purchased for all materials that are entering in our plants. In our systems, we have master data of each material which is part of the product recipe, meaning that for each of our produced products, we know how much material we have used. The same for resource outflows – we know the exact amount of every ingredient and packaging material used in any sold products. Reusable packaging is not reported to the Packaging Recovery Organisations (PROs) for the floating volumes (i.e., all the bottles in circulation). We report only the new quantities of bottles purchased each year. This approach assumes that new bottle purchases are not solely due to increased volume but also because some reusable bottles were not collected and ended up in the recycling stream. Additionally, once reusable bottles reach the end of their lifespan, they will eventually become waste and be recycled. So, we avoid double counting by only reporting to the PROs the new quantities purchased each year, and not the whole floating (or in circulation) volume related to reusable/refillable glass bottles. E5-5 Resource outflows Outflows Resource outflows are another material topic for us. E5-5_01 We are committed to incorporate more circular principles in our production processes, and for that purpose we have implemented key actions and innovations. Now, five of our water brands are sold in 100% rPET bottles: Romerquelle (Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia), Deep RiverRock (Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland), Valser (Switzerland), Dorna (Romania) and Natura (Czech Republic and Slovakia). Switzerland was also our first country to move its entire locally produced PET portfolio to 100% rPET. This was followed by Italy1 and Austria, and in 2023, Romania, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland also transitioned to 100% rPET for the locally produced PET portfolio. In addition, since 2023, Romania successfully combined a 100% rPET local bottle portfolio, an in-house rPET facility and a Deposit Return Scheme, helping us close the loop for plastic packaging circularity. We continue our use of recycled shrink film in Ireland, where our Deep RiverRock water multipacks are packaged in Reborn®, a fully recycled plastic film made from post-industrial and post-consumer waste. We are exploring opportunities to launch Reborn® in other markets. Our corrugated cardboard packaging in Europe contains >80% recycled content, while our composite paper carton packs, KeelClipTM, Qflex and LitePac Top, are 100% FSC-certified. Our wooden pallets are 100% reusable. Coca-Cola HBC Integrated Annual Report 2024 128 Supplementary Information Swiss Statutory Reporting Financial Statements Corporate Governance Strategic Report"
"Sustainability Statement continued E5-5_04 As mentioned, we ensure that our packaging includes recyclable content. For 2024, the overall recyclable content rate of our packaging is 100%. We do not engage in the production or commercialisation of durable plastic goods and/or components, including those made from mixed materials. Additionally, we do not produce goods with an expected usage period exceeding three years. Our beverages, in particular, have a significantly shorter expected usage period, defined by their shelf life which is between four and 12 months. Extended Producer’s Responsibility E5-5_18 We make strong efforts to ensure that our products, especially their packaging materials, will not end up as waste. We prove our engagement in product end-of-life waste management, since, as mentioned earlier, we support the foundation of effective and efficient collection systems in all our markets. We are leading industry efforts to introduce DRS across the majority of our EU countries. In 2024, we played a pivotal role in the successful go-live of new DRS in Romania, Ireland and Hungary. Well-designed DRS have a proven track record of delivering very high collection rates, typically over 90%, once the schemes reach maturity. We are encouraged by the results from year 1 in Romania, where the scheme was delivering an average return rate of 76% for all in-scope containers across the last three months of the year. Additionally, our teams in Austria, Poland and Greece have been making intensive preparations to support successful DRS launches in 2025. These extensive preparations include the development of DRS business plans, the establishment of a new DRS administrator company in Poland, as well as the extensive internal planning to ensure that DRS-compliant packaging is available to the consumer on shelf in time. Coca-Cola HBC is also heavily involved in EPR systems in 25 of our countries, and members of the supervisory board in 16 of these countries. Extended producer responsibility is a policy approach that holds producers accountable for their products throughout the entire lifecycle, including the post-consumer stage. Further information is available at Ε5-2 ‘Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy’. Data methodology E5-5_06 The relevant data used is sourced mainly from direct measurements, which are taken from our production and operational records. Products are classified as designed along circular principles if they are recyclable by design. This means that the packaging is compatible with waste management and processing, including collection, sorting, recycling and the use of recycled materials to replace primary raw materials. We know the exact amount of every ingredient and packaging material used in any sold products. For packaging collection data, we have a calculation methodology document which details step by step how the data is collected. We report to our collection systems the amounts of packaging per type of material placed on the market. They then report back to us via emails and reports how much equivalent packaging was collected for recycling – this is validated following the Packaging Recovery Organisation’s (PRO’s) own external auditing processes. This is done per material type, both for primary and for secondary/tertiary packaging. If packaging materials contain the amount of the same material coming from post-consumer waste, they are with recycled content. The percentage of recycled content in our products and packaging is determined based on actual data from our suppliers and on what we have been using in our production. E5-6 Anticipated financial effects from material resource use and circular economy- related risks and opportunities E5-6_02, 03, 04 Given the potential impact that significant changes to our packaging mix could have to longer-term capital investment in production and distribution, and the influence that packaging has on our ability to meet our NetZeroby40 commitments – packaging represents over 30% of our emissions – managing the risk and opportunity associated with sustainable packaging directly impacts and is impacted by our future business strategy. It is closely linked with the ‘Managing our carbon footprint’ risk, which is covered in detail under ESRS E1 ‘Climate change’. During 2024, we continued building on our Pack Mix of the Future vision. The development of a profitable packaging strategy aims to reduce our environmental impact, address escalating stakeholder concerns relating to packaging waste and takes into account new EU regulations such as the EU Directive on packaging and packaging waste. Initiatives such as increasing the use of recycled and refillable packaging and decarbonisation in the packaging industry contribute significantly to our journey towards NetZeroby40. Based on the 2024 quantification of this risk we expect higher cost of packaging materials, mainly rPET, aluminium and glass. The quantification was performed by applying the projected carbon price per packaging material under different climate scenarios to the corresponding packaging emissions as per our glidepath to 2040. These financial effects are anticipated to arise in the mid to long term. While the timing remains uncertain, we are aligning our strategy with the evolving market conditions. Failing to respond to consumers’ concerns about packaging could also impact our reputation and consumer base, potentially leading to revenue losses for products that do not meet sustainability standards. Other challenges associated with packaging relate to dependencies on sourcing sustainable materials from suppliers, and to the increasing regulatory focus on impacts to natural ecosystems caused by packaging waste. E5-6_05 & E5-6_06 Our assessment shows we do not have any product at risk in the short-, medium- or long- term horizon. For the assessment of products at risk, the same time horizons as those used in the Double Materiality Assessment were applied, as presented in the E1.IRO-1_05.

"Sustainability Statement continued Strategy SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model S2.SBM-3_01, 02, 03, 05, 06 At CCHBC, all value chain workers who may be materially impacted by our operations are included in the scope of disclosures under ESRS 2. This encompasses addressing impacts linked to our own operations and value chain, including those arising from our products, services and business relationships. We specifically report on key areas such as secure employment, adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality, equal pay for work of equal value, and training and skills development. Types of value chain workers We consider value chain workers, workers working on our sites, but who are not part of own workforce, i.e., who are not self-employed workers or workers provided by third-party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities. In essence: • They are outsourced to a separate company that manages its own staff; • Coca-Cola HBC does not directly control the workers; instead, it has a business relationship with the service provider; • The responsibility for managing and employing the workers lies with the service provider, even if the work is performed at CCHBC’s premises; • The external service provide retains responsibility for hiring, managing and supervising, and CCHBC has a business relationship with the service provider, not the individual workers. Examples include pickers and forklift drivers in our warehouses, workers sorting our empty reusable bottles at our plant facilities, cleaning services workers and workers working at our wastewater treatment facilities in the plants and drivers of the delivery trucks by our outsourced logistics. We also consider value chain workers, a variety of workers in the supply base that execute various activities either in an office context or within the agricultural sector and industrial sectors. Our supply base focus is Tier 1 suppliers and aspire to cover for the Tier 2 or below suppliers through the Supplier’s commitment on SGPs or PSA in the case of agricultural ingredients. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of vendors must acknowledge acceptance of CCH SGPs before they can proceed to work with us across sectors and sourcing categories and are monitored on compliance through various tools depending on complexity and criticality of their operations. Specifically, the Strategic Group Suppliers, we actively ask them to confirm ESG compliance including social and human rights attributes, for their critical supply base, i.e. T2 layer or below for CCH. This equally includes white and blue collar works across industries. Specifically for agricultural suppliers, we aspire to cover 100% of our supply base through PSA certifications provided by third-party specialists, which are specifically covering through audits, the practices of farmers and their positioning towards workers of the land such as SAI FSA, ISCC Plus, BONSUCRO, REDcert2, Rainforest Alliance, FairTrade International, Global GAP+GRASP, Global GAP+FSA Add-On, UNILEVER SAC, etc. Our negative effect We have no widespread or systemic material negative impacts on value chain workers in contexts where we operate. Regardless of the high occupational health and safety standards we require by our contractors and service providers, we still report lost time accidents which is the reason to consider negative impact there. Any occupational health and safety incidents are individual. One value chain worker’s fatality was reported in 2024. The contractor lost-time incidents frequency rate (LTIFR) in 2024 is decreasing to 1.31 compared to 1.72 in 2023.

"Sustainability Statement continued Brief description of the activities that result in the positive impacts In general People who are considered as value chain workers, such as staff of third-party service providers, (e.g., for security or canteens), who work at our facilities are part of our OH&S, Food Safety, including WASH (clean water and sanitation) access, and Environmental programmes. In addition, they are included in all our Workplace Accountability audits, which are conducted through an internationally recognised and accredited auditing organisation. The audits specifically cover third-party contracted labour in our premises. Third-party logistics workers (warehouse, transport and distribution) are also mandated to follow our quality, health and safety and environmental standards. At CCHBC, we have a robust programme in place to annually review every year the risks and performance of all our suppliers against our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGPs), Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), Water Risk Assessment, as well as other equally important aspects with impact on our business, such as supply risk and financial stability. Sustainability is a key criterion in supplier selection under strategic sourcing, as well as a criterion for the Annual Supplier Review process that we conduct cross-functionally for critical supply base. To ensure that suppliers demonstrate ESG requirements compliance, we rely in multiple screening and assessment practices that offer us a holistic view of their performance, leveraging multiple tools depending on Supplier categorisation, criticality and impact to our business. The Sustainable Agriculture programme secures ESG monitoring through PSA certification process of the Coca- Cola System across all agricultural commodities. For the remaining supply base, we have designed a robust assessment journey leveraging ESG physical audits, as well as a number of globally recognised screening and assessment tools, such as EcoVadis IQ Plus, EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX, Supply Based Assessment executed by specialist consultants for Group Critical suppliers, WWF Water Risk Filter Assessment, Resilinc Event Watch, Exiger and Moody’s Analytics. One of our Mission 2025 commitments is to ensure that 100% of our key agricultural ingredients (sugar, high fructose starch syrup (HFSS) and Juices fruit crops) are certified by third-party organisations that specialise in agricultural practices providing trainings and implementing audit to secure appropriate implementation of our standards. For full compliance with our PSA, we require our agricultural suppliers to be assessed and certified in accordance with third-party standards, depending on the relevant ingredient. For a comprehensive list of standards, please refer at the text above ‘Types of value chain workers’. Furthermore, ingredient and packaging suppliers must meet GFSI recognised standards, and Tier 1 suppliers are prompted to comply with ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45000 as applicable depending on their industry specifics, as well as impact and criticality to our business. Finally, we target over 95% of our procurement addressable spending to be on local suppliers in our countries of operation (local sourcing). In 2024, we had 97.7% sourced locally representing around €5.3 billion (excluding concentrate supplies) of procurement addressable spend. Supply within European Union we define as local to EU countries. Through our socio-economic impact studies (SEIS), we evaluate the direct, indirect and induced impact we have from suppliers to our trade partners and our contribution is significant, especially in emerging markets. The latest SEIS shows that every direct job in our system leads to 13 jobs in the value chain, and in many of the countries where we operate, our contribution to the beverage industry is significant. For the supplier workforce, we secure equal access employment, adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development through the application and compliance tracking of the supplier SGPs and PSAs. Workers in the value chain are supported with training and capability building programmes offered by supplier organisations and Coca-Cola HBC to develop understanding of the sustainability elements and positive impacts and are supported to operate in a new innovative manner that secures smooth transition to climate-neutral operations without the loss of jobs. This is a journey of transition that takes time, but we work with our most significant suppliers to support and record improvement. Gradually jobs are transformed to support the new models and secured at a minimum, while in many cases we detect the creation of new positions and opportunities by supplier organisations to support the climate transition. Access to education Since 2023, we have established annual trainings delivered both to our buyers and our significant suppliers on various topics, including ESG requirements, actions to improve ESG scoring, the importance of sustainability, the EcoVadis Assessments, deforestation, modern slavery and GHG emissions. For strategic suppliers, we aim to recruit them all under the EcoVadis Assessment Platform to track ESG overall performance and, with the support of the EcoVadis team, we promote the use of the EcoVadis Academy to help vendors build better knowledge of important ESG elements. We place specific focus on developing GHG performance tracking for our supply base, starting with a pilot programme for the development of supplier-specific emission factors (SSEFs) with our most sustainably mature suppliers that is now planned to be expanded within 2025 to a much broader supply base. For less mature suppliers, since 2022 we have been working with Guidehouse on capacity building programmes, offering training through the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (SLoCT) programme annually. This initiative helps our less mature suppliers build a strong foundation to start reducing GHG emissions. In November 2023, we held our second Virtual Supplier Sustainability Event, ‘Opening up a more sustainable future together’, where we invited all our Group critical suppliers to discuss emissions reduction, biodiversity and deforestation. Over 400 participants from nearly 200 suppliers, Coca-Cola System colleagues, and trade partners attended our virtual Supplier Day conference. Our partners, CDP and the World Economic Forum, provided expert guidance, tools and tips for suppliers on climate action. Additionally, our suppliers Nordzucker, Ball Corporation and Graphic Packaging International shared their sustainability progress. In 2024, we expanded upon this initiative, engaging with our key suppliers on GHG performance. Through this engagement we have begun developing emissions glidepaths to enhance supplier emissions performance, aiming to meet our scope 3 targets. For more information about Annual stakeholder forum please refer to SBM-2_05, 06. Read more Contribution to employment Please see S1. SBM-3_01-04, 06, 11 (Contribution to Employment Accessibility to a living wage We expect our suppliers to compensate their employees fairly and competitively within their industry, fully complying with applicable local and national wage and hour laws. Additionally, we encourage our suppliers to provide opportunities for employees to develop their skills and capabilities, and to adhere to the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value.

"Sustainability Statement continued We aspire to secure correct practices towards supplier workers through the SGPs and PSA implementation. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of our suppliers are obliged to acknowledge and agree to the SGPs before obtaining the right to do business with us, while we apply different monitoring tools to track compliance depending on supplier category and impact to our business ranging from ESG performance tracking by means of tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus all the way to full scale assessments such as EcoVadis Assessment, SEDEX and SGP physical audits. On agricultural level, we leverage our third-party specialists to conduct audits against the PSA principles, that are covering in an extensive manner all rules and requirements to secure farmer workers. Provision of social protection and social security Contractors who work on our premises are included in our programmes and workplace accountability audits, conducted within a three-year audit cycle. During these audits, they are assessed on human rights, and compliance with local minimum wage laws is verified by an external company. The workplace accountability audits cover various areas, including laws and regulations, wages and benefits, working hours and overtime, business Integrity, work environment, health and safety, environmental practices and demonstration of compliance. Occupational Health and Safety In the context of our implementation of Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001), we take actions which have in scope value chain workers. We implement health and safety programmes, including Behavioural Based Safety and Life Saving Rules: • We enhanced our behaviour-based safety programme by embedding more human and operational principles across manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations. • We ensured Life Saving Rules are in place and incorporated in our cross-country verification programme. We conducted quarterly assessments of all manufacturing and non- manufacturing facilities. Based on these assessments, each country has developed its own corrective actions to address critical gaps and achieve full compliance. Value chain workers in greater risk of harm The service provided workers performing a job at our premises are part of the same rigorous hazardous analysis related to the occupational health and safety, as our employees, e.g., confined space work, work at height, electrical work, etc. Based on those analysis and based on the external occupational health and safety guidelines, we know the jobs that potentially can lead to severe OH&S incidents and thus we set up specific measures to mitigate the potential risks and avoid the incident to happen. Impact, risk and opportunity management S2-1 Policies related to value chain workers S2.MDR-P_01-06 & S2-1_06 The relevant policies adopted to manage material sustainability matters include our Occupational Health and Safety Policy and Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), as well as our Supplier Guiding Principles, which have been adopted as part of ongoing effort to develop and strengthen our relationships with our direct suppliers. These policies cover all types of value chain workers mentioned in the previous section. Occupational Health and Safety Policy Please see S1.MDR-P_01-06 & S1-1_01, 02, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21 Supplier Guiding Principles Key contents of the policy The ‘Supplier Guiding Principles’ includes expectations regarding CCHBC’s suppliers to: • judge their employees and contractors based upon their ability to do their jobs and not upon their physical and/or personal characteristics or beliefs, affirming the principle of no discrimination based on race, colour, gender, age, religion, political opinion, national origin or sexual orientation; • provide a safe workplace with policies and practices in place to minimise the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks; • compensate their employees fairly and competitively relative to their industry, in full compliance with applicable local and national wage and hour laws, and to offer opportunities for employees to develop their skills and capabilities, and to follow the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. Objective Through this policy, we seek to develop relationships with suppliers that share similar values and conduct business in an ethical manner. Process for monitoring Regarding the process for monitoring this policy, in Coca-Cola HBC 100% of our supplier are obliged to acknowledge and agree to the SGPs before obtaining the right to do business with us, while we apply different monitoring tools to track compliance depending on supplier category and impact to our business. To this purpose we use various tools, ranging from EcoVadis IQ Plus all the way to full scale assessments such SGP physical audits, SEDEX and EcoVadis Assessment. We collaborate with TCCC, which routinely utilises independent third parties to assess suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles. The assessments include confidential interviews with employees and on-site contract workers. Scope As part of ongoing efforts to develop and strengthen our relationships with suppliers, we have adopted these Supplier Guiding Principles for use with our direct suppliers. Most senior level accountable for the implementation of the policy Each sustainability policy is approved by the CEO and the ELT and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board. The Chief Supply Chain Officer and Chief Procurement Officer are accountable for the implementation of the policy. Commitment to respect third-party standards We commit through the implementation of Supplier Guiding Principles to respect applicable laws and standards with respect to their operations (e.g., ILO Standards, etc.) Consideration given to the interests of key stakeholders in setting the policy In developing the SGP, we have considered international standards such as ISO 14001, ISO 45000, the ILO and the UN Principles. We have also considered the requirements of investors and ESG raters such as S&P Global, MSCI ESG and CDP as well as the practices of peer companies who are part of UNESDA and BIER (Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable). Additionally, we have incorporated good practices recommended by NGOs such as WWF, and input from our suppliers. Policy available to potentially affected stakeholders All policies are available on our website. At business unit level, they are translated and, additionally, suppliers are mandated to sign our SGP, which is included as part of our contracts.

"Sustainability Statement continued Principles for Sustainable Agriculture Key contents of the policy The Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) describe the Company’s principles for sustainable agriculture based on environmental, social and economic criteria. The Human and Workplace Rights principles apply to all workers on the farm, industrial processes associated or transport services. All direct suppliers, intermediary processors, producing farms and labour agencies are expected to respect human rights and the below principles in line with international human rights principles and TCCC Supplier Guiding Principles. This policy covers topics, such as ‘Work Hours and Livelihoods’, ‘Eliminate Discrimination’ and ‘Health and Safety’, among others. For more information, please visit the Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA). Objective Through ‘Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA)’ we aim at primary production – that is, farm-level – and form the basis of our continued engagement with suppliers to achieve productivity, compliance, transparency, resiliency and continuous improvement of their farm base against these principles. On an agricultural level we leverage our third-party specialists, such as SAI/FSA, VIVE, Bonsucro, etc., to conduct audits against the PSA principles, that are covering in an extensive manner all rules and requirements to secure farmer workers. The results are represented to us by means of certifications obtained, that otherwise would not be awarded to our suppliers when discrepancies occur. We collect these certifications on an annual basis. Process for monitoring We monitor compliance through EcoVadis assessment and action plans, TCCC audit process and sustainable certification schemes. Scope The PSA, as a set of global principles, applies to all agricultural ingredients and plant-based packaging used in TCCC products. For our significant suppliers with substantial potential environmental impact, we also prompt and request that they embrace CDP for Climate, Forest and Water for disclosure of more detailed information and that they also build their own SBTi/SBTN commitments. So far, we have recruited 187 significant suppliers under CDP of which 119 have approved or committed to the SBTi and continue to build on this further by actively engaging, discussing and tracking progress with the support of TCCC. Most senior level accountable for the implementation of the policy Each sustainability policy is approved by the CEO and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board. The Chief Supply Chain Officer and Chief Procurement Officer are accountable for the implementation of the policy. Commitment to respect third-party standards The Company has approved a limited set of global third-party Sustainable Agriculture Standards as aligned with the expectations outlined in the PSA, among them is the ILO recommendations. Consideration given to the interests of key stakeholders in setting the policy Having a secure, sustainable supply of agricultural ingredients is imperative to meeting the expectations of our consumers, customers and other stakeholders – and to enabling the continued growth of our Company. In this context, the PSA reflects the most recent science and external stakeholder perspectives, covers new product categories and simplifies language, where possible. Policy available to potentially affected stakeholders All policies are available on our website. At BU level, they are translated and available at the local website. S2-1_01-04, 08, 09 & S2-4_11 Human Rights Policy commitments Commitments Please see S1.MDR-P_01-06 & S1-1_01, 02, 09-14, 16, 17, 21 Our ‘Supplier Guiding Principles’ apply to our suppliers and are aligned with the expectations and commitments of the Human Rights Policy. The Supplier Guiding Principles are aligned with internationally recognised instruments. If the eight Core Conventions of the International Labour Organisation establish higher standards than local law, the supplier shall meet the ILO standards. These minimum requirements are part of all agreements between CCHBC and our direct suppliers. For more information, please visit Human Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles. With regards to ‘Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA)’, human rights are based on the same guiding instruments too. We require compliance with those principles. Processes for monitoring compliance with international instruments Our Human Rights Policy is applicable to our suppliers, partners, contractors and 3PL logistics partners. Compliance is monitored through certifications and Workplace Accountability Audits. We monitor the performance of our significant suppliers through our annual internal supply base assessments, third-party audits of compliance, the EcoVadis IQ Plus Tool and EcoVadis Risk Assessment platform. EcoVadis helps us monitor, assess and benchmark a range of risks using 21 criteria from international standard setters, including the UN Global Compact, ISO 26000, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Based on the findings of the audits, wherever human rights issues were identified, we engaged with our suppliers to prepare corrective action plans. We monitor the progress and conduct audit within the year to secure no recurrence. In 2021, we revisited our Procurement Assessment guidelines to implement stricter rules over Human Rights, Ethics and Compliance practices expected from our suppliers and re-trained our entire Buyers’ community to the Sustainability Risk Assessment tools available for supplier selection and governance. We expect our suppliers to develop and implement appropriate internal business processes to ensure compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles. Suppliers are 100% obliged to acknowledge acceptance and adherence to the SGPs before commencing any collaboration with Coca-Cola HBC across all our business units. We track adherence to SGPs by leveraging third-party tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus to full scale audit tools like EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX and collaborate with TCCC, which routinely utilises independent third parties to assess suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles by means of physical audits, depending on the criticality of their business to our operations. All these activities are repeated by the Procurement team on annual basis. We apply the principle of three-year audit cycle for compliant suppliers, while for those suppliers with audit recommendations, any findings are addressed within maximum 12 months. Our Procurement teams across business units are trained on annual basis to assess risks, recruit suppliers under appropriate risk assessment mechanisms and ensure action plans are in place as needed. We track supplier performance and follow KBIs that indicate our progress on annual basis. Respect for the human rights, including labour rights of workers We are committed to identifying and preventing any adverse human rights impacts in relation to our business activities through human rights due diligence and preventive compliance processes. Moreover, regarding labour rights of our value chain workers, we are committed to supporting fair workplace practices, ensuring a fair work environment, and providing fair wages and benefits. Cases of non-respect to international instruments There are minor findings identified under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work or the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises that involve value chain workers have been reported in our upstream and downstream value chain as follows.

S2-2 Processes for engaging with value chain workers about impacts Through our ‘SpeakUp!’ line, available for both our employees and externally to everyone, we are able to see any comment or concern. The contacts of our company are easily available on the website and on the labels of our finished products. Through regular meetings with suppliers, through interviews by the external auditors they do with contractors during the ISO and Workplace accountability audits, and via the Work Councils we are also able to take into consideration the value chain workers’ view. The engagement as described above is done with the value chain workers directly during the ISO and Workplace Accountability audits’ interviews, and in case of any signal on ‘SpeakUp!’ line, or through credible proxies that have insight into their situation such as NGOs or Work Councils. We engage with our suppliers through the feedback received from our Group Annual Stakeholder Forum, as well as through the regular, ongoing interaction with the Coca-Cola System’s central procurement group and our technology and commodity suppliers. For contractor workers and health and safety, we have implemented standardised contractual clauses including health and safety requirements. All contractors working for CCH must have a health and safety induction training, specific for our premises. There are regular routines established with all contractors at the local business unit level, addressing not only OH&S topics. We do also an annual vendor evaluation where all contractors working at our premises are assessed based on different criteria including health and safety ones. After each external or internal audit, we address any improvement opportunity via an action discussed and agreed with contractors. Each severe OH&S incident or fatality is followed by a lesson learned session with the respective contractor/service provider. Most senior role that has operational responsibility for ensuring that engagement with value chain workers happens For suppliers, the Chief Procurement Officer has the most senior role with operational responsibility for ensuring that engagement with value chain workers happens. Under this role, at the operational level, this includes all Strategic Procurement Managers and the local Procurement Managers in every business unit. For contractors and 3PL Logistics contractors, the Chief Supply Chain Officer has operational responsibility for ensuring that this engagement happens. Under this role, the responsibility lies with the Head of Logistics, Head of QSE, Head of Health and Safety, and at local business unit level, with the country/business unit. S2-2_05 We respect workers’ rights (in the value chain) to form, join or not join a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or harassment, where they are represented by a legally recognised union, establish a constructive dialogue with their freely chosen representatives and bargain in good faith with such representatives. We do not control this engagement, and we do not interview someone directly. In case suppliers do not follow this approach, CCHBC can cancel the contract. S2-2_06 We assess indirectly the effectiveness of our engagement with workers in the value chain, in three ways, through audit results, score on questions related to suppliers from ESG raters and the number of grievances from the ‘SpeakUp!’ line.
