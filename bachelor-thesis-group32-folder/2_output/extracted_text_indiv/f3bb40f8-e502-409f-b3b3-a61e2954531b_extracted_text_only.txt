CTP presents GHG emission data using the financial control approach as required by the ESRS and the operational control approach commonly used in the real estate industry. The GHG emissions disclosed in this Annual Re- port relate to the Group and its value chain in relation to purchased goods and services, which are focused on the materials CTP uses for construction activities; and to downstream leased assets, which focus on emissions as a result of client operations. See Section 4.4 for more information on CTP’s structure. Using publicly available emission factors, CTP converted all energy consumption to tCO2e. Emission factors were obtained from carbonfootprint.com (for electricity) and the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) (for fuels). For district heat- ing, CTP uses data from relevant ministries of the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. For refrigerant losses, the Company uses the GHG Protocol list. These sources were applied across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 and were chosen as they are reputable and publicly available. Data for Q4 2024 was estimated by extrapolating actual data for the first three quarters of the year. Q4 was calculated as the mathematical average of Q1–Q3 and added to Q1–Q3 to calculate full-year data. CTP obtained energy consumption data from 80% of its portfolio. Therefore, estimates have been made to ensure 100% portfolio representation. Data was extrapolated by calculating the energy intensity for each country using obtained data and multiplying this with the floor area for which no data was obtained. The extrapola- tion together with an increase in emission factors are the main drivers of the increase in reported emissions.

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings. These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations. CTP is currently collecting data on the inflow of ma- terials, which will enable the creation of informed actions.

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous.

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 33 3.1 Overview of Business Environment & Trends CTP operates in ten European countries, from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The Group’s core business, the CTPark Network, services companies active in the industrial & logistics (“I&L”) sector. CTP is also focused on developing and operating advanced high-tech parks in conjunction with local universities and municipalities. The majority of CTP’s standing portfolio is in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”), with the remainder in Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. In general, CEE markets remain undersupplied and are growing faster than Western European markets. The major trends driving the development and growth of the I&L sector across Europe relate to recent and ongo- ing changes to the international geopolitical landscape, with companies focusing on supply chain resiliency and energy security, among others. This has led the emer- gence of nearshoring strategies, particularly in the high- tech manufacturing and ICT sectors, with a “made in Europe, for Europe” focus. The push toward ESG compli- ance and the need to decarbonise supply chains are also driving change. Western Europe remains a highly attractive destina- tion for foreign investors due to its mature and estab- lished markets, which offer stability and reliability. While the region boasts a long history of excellence in manu- facturing and technology, and world-renowned academ- ic institutions, Western European economies are in the midst of re-invention. They are are being transformed by emerging new industries, and previous more energy- and labour-intensive industries are being displaced or disap- pearing. CEE remains the business-smart choice for a wide range of activities, from high-tech manufacturing and R&D to logistics and e-commerce. With its mix of strate- gic location, developed infrastructure, skilled workforce, and overall lower operational costs, CEE is emerging as a “hotspot” for the deployment of European nearshoring strategies. Market maturity varies from country to coun- try, but CEE overall offers more opportunity for green- field investments than Western European markets. The European Union (“EU”) continues to make largescale investments to further develop transport infrastructure, with a focus on CEE. Investment incentives from the Member States are available for qualifying projects, par- ticularly in high-tech. 3.1.1 Economic situation and outlook in CEE Since 2008, CEE economies have consistently outper- formed other European regions and are expected to maintain this trend in the near term (Fig. 3.1). The mac- roeconomic outlook for CEE economies remains strong. After hitting a low point in 2023, economic growth has rebounded, driven by domestic demand fuelled by disin- flation, wage increases, and relaxed fiscal policies. On average, the GDP of CEE economies are expected to have a compounded annual growth (“CAGR”) of 2.2% between 2024–2029 (Fig. 3.1). S&P Global Ratings an- ticipates that CEE GDP growth will also benefit from robust foreign direct investment and substantial EU fund inflows. These factors are expected to more than cover any modest current account deficits, following the region’s significant external adjustment after the 2022 energy price shock. Germany, the largest economy in Europe with a real GDP of €3.617 billion in 2023, is projected to maintain its leading position in the next few decades, although its share of the EU’s total real GDP is expected to decrease slightly, from 21% to 20%. In terms of private consump- tion and total real household disposable income, Germany significantly outpaces the rest of Europe."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 123 4.7.1.1.8 Financial effects of climate IROs E1-9-66, E1-9-67, E1-9-68, E1-9-69, SBM-3-48, E1-IRO-1-20 In 2022, as a part of overall risk management, CTP con- ducted its first physical climate risk assessment to evalu- ate the exposure of its properties to acute and chronic cli- mate-related risks using a third-party climate modelling tool. The assessment was expanded in 2023 and 2024 to cover properties acquired and developed since 2022. In this assessment, the Company used different RCP models made available by the IPCC, considering items such as, but not limited to, coastal flooding, extreme heat, and water stress. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. The climate-related risks identified as potentially the most impactful to CTP are coastal flooding and rising sea levels. These have been categorised into short-, mid-, and long-term risks. Even in the least severe scenarios (SSP2, medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation), projections indicate that sea levels will rise significantly enough that, in the long term, the Company’s portfolio in the Netherlands could be affected, with some assets po- tentially falling below sea level. This is similarly true for a limited number of properties along the German Wadden Sea coast. However, CTP regards these risks as policy risks, given that both Dutch and German governments are implementing measures to mitigate them. Based on its analysis, CTP concludes that five of its properties1 are at risk, representing, at most, 1.2% of the portfolio’s value. As part of the climate risk assessment mentioned above, transition climate risks were also examined. CTP utilised the CRREM tool developed by the Carbon Risk Real Es- tate Monitor to evaluate which buildings might need ad- ditional investment to increase energy efficiency in order to meet anticipated regulatory requirements. However, given that CTP buildings support a variety of uses, even within a CRREM category, the Company ac- knowledges limitations to the applicability of the CRREM tool on its portfolio. Client energy consumption is includ- ed in the analysis and can vary significantly depending on the client’s industry. For instance, the size of the cold storage area within a warehouse is not considered as an input, although it significantly influences the building’s energy consumption and thus affects the outcome of the assessment. With the expected impacts of the EU’s En- ergy Performance Buildings Directive (“EPBD”), which was revised in 2024, CTP considers other aspects such as the Energy Performance Certificate (“EPC”) to be more accurate indicators of the energy efficiency of its buildings. CRREM was used as a testing and indication tool, while EPCs were used for a more precise assessment of transition climate risks. CTP continuously upgrades its portfolio to ensure that it retains its high energy clas- sifications. Construction of new buildings follows up-to- date requirements and CTP’s internal ESG requirements, which in many cases go beyond local building code re- quirements. Expected costs related to material and tran- sition climate risks have been calculated for a sample of properties, the outcome of which is presented in Section 4.7.1.1.1. The impact of the both physical and transition related cli- mate risks is expressed in the property values, as these go through a bi-annual evaluation process. CTP uses re- nowned valuators to ensure all climate-related aspects are taking into account. Additionally, properties are in- sured. Therefore, CTP considers expected costs as part of business as usual. CTP has not identified transition risks that are financially material to the portfolio over the short and medium term. Additionally, the long-term impact of physical cli- mate risks is presented in the paragraphs above, while the long-term impact of transition risks is considered as too volatile to be reliable. The volatility of energy prices in Europe in recent years have made CTP’s clients more aware of the short- and long-term costs of energy. There was a visible increase in client demand for energy from renewable sources during 2024. CTP expects its abili- ty to provide clients with renewable energy generated onsite at its parks, as well as other energy-efficiency measures that the Company takes, to attract more com- panies that consider total cost of occupancy as a main driver. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. CTP is a dynamic company with continuous growth through construction and acquisitions. The consistent arrival of new clients and ongoing changes to their oper- ations affect the consumption of utilities within the port- folio. This makes the creation of metrics difficult and re- quires more detailed analysis.

CTP’s four Core markets—the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia—represent almost 73% of the Group’s total owned GLA. CTP’s average market share in those markets stood at 28.8% as at 31 Decem- ber 2024, and the Group remains the largest owner and developer of industrial and logistics real estate assets in each Core market. The Group is also the market leader in Serbia and Bulgaria. With over 1,000 clients, CTP has a wide and diversified international client base, consisting of blue-chip compa- nies with strong credit ratings. CTP’s clients represent a broad range of industries, including manufacturing, high- tech/IT, automotive, and e-commerce, retail, wholesale, and third-party logistics. This client base is highly di- versified, with no single client accounting for more than 2.5% of its annual rent roll, which leads to a stable income stream. CTP’s top 50 clients only account for 35.2% of its rent roll and most are in multiple CTPark locations."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 41 3.2.2 Standing portfolio CTP develops, owns and manages a high-quality portfo- lio of assets in over 250 locations. The Group increased its investment portfolio from 11.8 million sqm of owned GLA in 2023 to 13.3 million sqm at end-2024. Growth was mainly organic, with deliveries of 1.3 million sqm and the acquisition of 0.3 million sqm of value-add and in- come-producing assets. With its market-leading portfo- lio throughout continental Europe, the Group’s business generates strong cash flows. CTP can realise the highest incremental return with the development of new properties in our CTPark Network, as these are developed in-house, on land that it has already paid for and mostly for existing clients, which is why such deliveries are the main driver of the Company’s growth. The Group’s annualised income increased to €743 million (31 December 2023: €644 million), an increase year-on-year of 15%. An increasing proportion of the rental income gener- ated by CTP’s investment portfolio benefits from infla- tion protection. Since end-2019, all the Group’s new lease agreements include a double indexation clause, which cal- culates annual rental increases as the higher of: • a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year; or • the Consumer Price Index. As at 31 December 2024, 71% (31 December 2023: 66%) of income generated by the Group’s portfolio includes this double indexation clause, and the Group aims to in- crease this further. The remaining 29% of the portfolio has only a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year, and there- fore more reversionary potential built-in. The indexation takes place on 1 January of each year in the majority of the lease agreements. Therefore, the growth in rental in- come relating to 2024 inflation will only be recorded in the 2025. The Company’s occupancy stood at 93% at year-end (31 December 2023: 94%). CTP targets an occupancy rate around 95% with a few percentage points of va- cancy, as this flexibility is key to optimise client relation- ships and drive rental growth. CTP’s business model and strategy are focused on being a long-term business part- ner, to support existing clients to grow in their existing location or at another park within the CTPark Network. Some of CTP’s clients have already extended more than five times in their existing location. CTP therefore starts some developments before having secured pre-letting; however, this is concentrated in existing parks, where the Company has good visibility on future demand and deep market knowledge. This allows CTP to maintain a mar- ket-leading client retention rate of 87% (31 December 2023: 90%), which demonstrates CTP’s ability to lever- age long-standing client relationships. The rent collection level stabilised at 99.8% (31 De- cember 2023: 99.9%), with no deterioration in the pay- ment profile. In 2024, CTP realised a like-for-like growth of 4.0%, mainly driven by reversion and indexation. Countries with the highest like-for-like rental growth were Slovakia and Poland. The weighted average unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) of CTP’s investment portfolio stood at 6.4 years at the period end (31 December 2023: 6.6 years), in line with the Company’s target of >6 years. The reversionary potential stands at 14.5% as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 14.5%), illustrat- ing the future rental growth potential. The Group has the highest reversionary potential in the Germany with 25.9%. Based on the expiry schedule, the Group is expected to be able to capture more than 28% of the reversionary potential in the coming five years. During 2024, leases, on average, were signed above their estimated rental val- ue (“ERV”), supporting both the Group’s reversionary po- tential and valuations."

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 124 4.7.1.2 ESRS E5 – Material Resource Use and Circular Economy 4.7.1.2.1 Material IROs relating to material resource use and circular economy E5-IRO-1-11 As part of the 2024 DMA, material resource use and cir- cular economy (ESRS E5) was identified as a material top- ic, applicable to all business units and assets considering the development, construction, and operational phases of these assets. The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website. CTP also has internal waste management require- ments, which include requirements for new construction and refurbishments. CTP has yet to develop policies related to resource inflows."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."
