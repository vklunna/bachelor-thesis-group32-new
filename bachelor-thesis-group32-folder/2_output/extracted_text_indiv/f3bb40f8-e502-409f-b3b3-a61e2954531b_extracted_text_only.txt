"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 45 3.2.3 Development After completing 1.2 million sqm of GLA in 2023, CTP continued its disciplined investment in its highly profita- ble pipeline and set a new record of 1.3 million sqm deliv- ered in 2024. The developments were approximately 92% let at delivery and will generate an annualised contracted rental income of €83.4 million, with another €7.3 million when these reach full occupancy. Some of the main deliveries during 2024 were: 169,000 sqm at CTPark Warsaw West (Poland); 120,000 sqm at CTPark Budapest Szigetszentmiklós (Hungary); 87,000 sqm at CTPark Ploiesti (Romania); 67,000 sqm at CTPark Bucharest West (Romania); 57,000 sqm at CTPark Warsaw South (Poland); 52,000 sqm at CTPark Novi Sad East (Serbia); 48,000 sqm at CTPark Zabrze (Poland); 44,000 sqm at CTPark Weiden (Germany); 37,000 sqm at CTPark Budapest Ecser (Hungary); and 37,000 sqm at CTPark Žilina Airport (Slovakia). While average construction costs in 2022 totalled around €550 per sqm, in 2023 and 2024 they lowered to €500 per sqm. CTP expects construction costs to stay roughly at this level through 2025. This allows the Group to continue to deliver its industry-leading YoC above 10%, which is also supported by CTP’s unique Parkmak- er strategy and in-house construction and procurement expertise. CTP was able to deliver its projects in 2024 with a YoC of 10.1% (2023: 10.8%). The Group targets a YoC of 11% for new construction across its core CEE markets, with lower targets of 10% for Poland and 9% in Nether- lands, Germany and Austria. This industry-leading level is supported by the Company’s unique park model and in- house expertise. At the end of 2024, the Group had 1.8 million sqm of pro- jects under construction with a potential rental income of €142 million and an expected YoC of 10.3%. The largest expansion markets are Czech Republic and Poland, with 482,000 sqm and 283,000 sqm under construction, re- spectively. CTP has a long track record of delivering sustainable growth through its client-led development in its existing parks. 80% of the Group’s projects under construction are in existing parks, while 7% are in new parks that have the potential to be developed to more than 100,000 sqm of GLA. The Group is targeting the delivery of 1.2 million sqm–1.7 million sqm in 2025, subject to client demand. The 80,000 sqm of leases that are currently signed for future projects that have not yet started are an illustra- tion of continued occupier demand. Planned 2025 deliveries are 35% pre-let (planned 2024 deliveries were 38% pre-let at YE-2023) and CTP expects to reach 80%–90% pre-letting at delivery, in line with historical performance. As CTP acts in most markets as general contractor, it is fully in control of the process and timing of deliveries, allowing the Company to speed up or slow down depending on client demand, while also offering clients flexibility in terms of building requirements. The Group replenishes its landbank on a continuous ba- sis. CTP focuses on acquiring development sites that are adjacent to existing parks or in sought-after locations with proximity to strong logistics hubs and transport corridors and large, densely populated cities. In 2024, the Group invested €386 million (2023: €224 million) to ex- pand its landbank (excluding options), focusing particu- larly on acquiring sites within its Growth and Western European Markets. In the higher interest rate environ- ment, the Group prefers to secure land through options where possible. CTP’s landbank amounted to 26.4 million sqm at year-end 2024 (2023: 23.4 million sqm), which allows the Company to reach exceed its target of 20 million sqm. GLA before the end of the decade. 18% of the landbank was secured by options (2023: 24%), while the remaining 82% was owned and accordingly reflected in the balance sheet (2023: 76%). 57% of the landbank is located within CTP’s existing parks, while 33% is in or is adjacent to new parks that have the potential to grow to more than 100,000 sqm. The total landbank, which is part of the Group’s In- vestment Properties, was valued at €1,292 million (2023: €920 million). The revaluation in 2024 amounted to €61 million (2023: €104 million)."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 118 The CSRD requires companies to report on greenhouse gas emissions using data points established by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG Protocol”)—a multi-stakeholder initiative to assist countries and companies to account for, report and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions with a set of global standards. The GHG Protocol “Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard” provides a step-by-step guide to quantify and report GHG emissions across a company’s value chain and classifies emissions under three distinct categories, or Scopes, which define the boundaries for the accounting of inventories of GHG emissions. Scope inventory and boundaries Overview of CTP reporting Direct Emissions Scope 1 Direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. These relate mainly to the energy consumed at the reporting entity’s build- ings and fuel use for company vehicles. • energy consumption at CTP’s corporate offices • energy consumption at buildings leased to clients • fuel consumption of CTP’s corporate vehicles and aircraft Indirect Emissions Scope 2 Indirect emissions related to purchased energy for buildings and vehicles. Emissions are accounted for in the reporting entity’s Scope 2 inventory as they result from the organisa- tion’s energy use. • emissions relating to energy for corporate offices • emissions relating to energy for buildings leased to clients • emissions relating to fuel consumption of CTP’s vehicles and aircraft Scope 3 Value chain emissions. These are indirect emissions (not covered in Scope 2) that occur in the val- ue chain of the reporting compa- ny, including both upstream and downstream emissions. Scope 3 is broad but in general includes emissions relating to purchased goods and services, transpor- tation costs, and related waste disposal. • emissions relating to the production of materials procured for construction activities • emissions relating to transportation costs of materials • emissions relating to waste disposal in connection with the production of construction materials The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the three Scopes"
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 119 What is a value chain? For sustainability reporting, a company’s value chain includes all goods and services in its upstream (suppli- er) and downstream (customer) activities. Under the GHG Protocol, Scope 3 value chain emissions encom- pass the product lifecycle emissions associated with the production and use of a specific product from cradle to grave, including emissions from raw materials, manufacturing, transport, storage, sale, use and disposal. Upstream Downstream Indirect GHG emissions relating mainly to interactions with suppliers Indirect GHG emissions relating mainly to interactions with customers. • Purchased goods and services • Transportation and distribution of products/materials • Capital goods • Processing of sold products/materials • Fuel and energy-related activities • Use of sold products/materials • Transportation and distribution • End-of-life treatment of sold products/materials • Waste generated in operations • Leased assets • Business travel • Franchises • Employee commuting • Investments • Leased assets Main impact areas of CTP’s value chain • Production, waste disposal, and transport of construction materials • Energy consumption at buildings leased to clients See Section 4.4 for more information on CTP’s value chain. See Section 4.7.1.1.3 for more information on CTP’s Environmental Policy."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 120 4.7.1.1.7 Greenhouse gases E1-6-44, E1-6-46, E1-6-47, E1-6-48, E1-6-49, E1-6-50, E1-6-51, E1-6-52, E1-6-53, E1-6-54, E1-6-55 CTP’s GHG emissions have been calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol. CTP presents GHG emission data using the financial control approach as required by the ESRS and the operational control approach commonly used in the real estate industry. The GHG emissions disclosed in this Annual Re- port relate to the Group and its value chain in relation to purchased goods and services, which are focused on the materials CTP uses for construction activities; and to downstream leased assets, which focus on emissions as a result of client operations. See Section 4.4 for more information on CTP’s structure. Using publicly available emission factors, CTP converted all energy consumption to tCO2e. Emission factors were obtained from carbonfootprint.com (for electricity) and the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) (for fuels). For district heat- ing, CTP uses data from relevant ministries of the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. For refrigerant losses, the Company uses the GHG Protocol list. These sources were applied across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 and were chosen as they are reputable and publicly available. Data for Q4 2024 was estimated by extrapolating actual data for the first three quarters of the year. Q4 was calculated as the mathematical average of Q1–Q3 and added to Q1–Q3 to calculate full-year data. CTP obtained energy consumption data from 80% of its portfolio. Therefore, estimates have been made to ensure 100% portfolio representation. Data was extrapolated by calculating the energy intensity for each country using obtained data and multiplying this with the floor area for which no data was obtained. The extrapola- tion together with an increase in emission factors are the main drivers of the increase in reported emissions.

For category 6 data is available within the organisation, and therefore it is reported. Scope 3 categories 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15, are not significant to CTP’s business operations based on the size of the emission. CTP’s GHG intensity is calculated using the emis- sions of Scope 1 and 2, divided by the net revenue of 2024. A negligible percentage of net revenue was obtained from non-high-climate impact sectors; therefore, this revenue is included in the calculation. The denominator for GHG intensity is total revenue. In addition to the assurance provider, reported data in this section (energy consumption, refrigerant losses, and respective GHG emissions excluding intensities) is vali- dated by Arcadis in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2019. The process includes review of a sample and review against underlying evidence, verifying the correctness of the calculations and results. The GHG intensity reduction from 2023 to 2024 is driven mostly by an increase in net revenue Scope 3 category 1 was calculated using available data for completed buildings. The emission intensities have been determined on the country level. These intensities were used as the basis on which to calculate the reported figures for 2024 multiplying the intensities by the GLA (sqm) of completed buildings in each country in 2024. CTP’s emissions are not regulated under the Europe- an Union Emissions Trading System. There were no significant changes in 2024 to the definition of what constitutes CTP and its upstream and downstream value chain. Within its Scope 3 emissions, CTP has included the following categories: Category 1 Purchased goods and services Category 6 Business travel Category 13 Downstream leased assets"
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 123 4.7.1.1.8 Financial effects of climate IROs E1-9-66, E1-9-67, E1-9-68, E1-9-69, SBM-3-48, E1-IRO-1-20 In 2022, as a part of overall risk management, CTP con- ducted its first physical climate risk assessment to evalu- ate the exposure of its properties to acute and chronic cli- mate-related risks using a third-party climate modelling tool. The assessment was expanded in 2023 and 2024 to cover properties acquired and developed since 2022. In this assessment, the Company used different RCP models made available by the IPCC, considering items such as, but not limited to, coastal flooding, extreme heat, and water stress. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. The climate-related risks identified as potentially the most impactful to CTP are coastal flooding and rising sea levels. These have been categorised into short-, mid-, and long-term risks. Even in the least severe scenarios (SSP2, medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation), projections indicate that sea levels will rise significantly enough that, in the long term, the Company’s portfolio in the Netherlands could be affected, with some assets po- tentially falling below sea level. This is similarly true for a limited number of properties along the German Wadden Sea coast. However, CTP regards these risks as policy risks, given that both Dutch and German governments are implementing measures to mitigate them. Based on its analysis, CTP concludes that five of its properties1 are at risk, representing, at most, 1.2% of the portfolio’s value. As part of the climate risk assessment mentioned above, transition climate risks were also examined. CTP utilised the CRREM tool developed by the Carbon Risk Real Es- tate Monitor to evaluate which buildings might need ad- ditional investment to increase energy efficiency in order to meet anticipated regulatory requirements. However, given that CTP buildings support a variety of uses, even within a CRREM category, the Company ac- knowledges limitations to the applicability of the CRREM tool on its portfolio. Client energy consumption is includ- ed in the analysis and can vary significantly depending on the client’s industry. For instance, the size of the cold storage area within a warehouse is not considered as an input, although it significantly influences the building’s energy consumption and thus affects the outcome of the assessment. With the expected impacts of the EU’s En- ergy Performance Buildings Directive (“EPBD”), which was revised in 2024, CTP considers other aspects such as the Energy Performance Certificate (“EPC”) to be more accurate indicators of the energy efficiency of its buildings. CRREM was used as a testing and indication tool, while EPCs were used for a more precise assessment of transition climate risks. CTP continuously upgrades its portfolio to ensure that it retains its high energy clas- sifications. Construction of new buildings follows up-to- date requirements and CTP’s internal ESG requirements, which in many cases go beyond local building code re- quirements. Expected costs related to material and tran- sition climate risks have been calculated for a sample of properties, the outcome of which is presented in Section 4.7.1.1.1. The impact of the both physical and transition related cli- mate risks is expressed in the property values, as these go through a bi-annual evaluation process. CTP uses re- nowned valuators to ensure all climate-related aspects are taking into account. Additionally, properties are in- sured. Therefore, CTP considers expected costs as part of business as usual. CTP has not identified transition risks that are financially material to the portfolio over the short and medium term. Additionally, the long-term impact of physical cli- mate risks is presented in the paragraphs above, while the long-term impact of transition risks is considered as too volatile to be reliable. The volatility of energy prices in Europe in recent years have made CTP’s clients more aware of the short- and long-term costs of energy. There was a visible increase in client demand for energy from renewable sources during 2024. CTP expects its abili- ty to provide clients with renewable energy generated onsite at its parks, as well as other energy-efficiency measures that the Company takes, to attract more com- panies that consider total cost of occupancy as a main driver. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. CTP is a dynamic company with continuous growth through construction and acquisitions. The consistent arrival of new clients and ongoing changes to their oper- ations affect the consumption of utilities within the port- folio. This makes the creation of metrics difficult and re- quires more detailed analysis. Despite these limitations, CTP carried out an analysis of its clients, which confirms that none of its clients operate in the coal, oil, or gas- related sectors. 1 Properties located in NUTS Code areas NL3, DE8, and DE9."

The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website.

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings. These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations. CTP is currently collecting data on the inflow of ma- terials, which will enable the creation of informed actions.

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. The type of buildings CTP constructs, mostly light indus- trial and logistics buildings, have an expected average du- rability of 50–60 years, in line with the industry average. Beyond CTP’s assurance provider, no other validation took place. 4.7.1.2.6 Financial effects of IROs relating to resource use and circular economy E5-6-41, E5-6-43 CTP’s 2024 DMA process did not identify any risks or op- portunities related to circular economy; therefore, CTP does not foresee a financial impact.

CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 127 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being
"Strategy & Outlook 29 2.2.2 Capitalising on market opportunities The I&L sector is transitioning from being seen by cli- ents as a pure cost centre to a driver of performance (see Section 3.1 for more details). This transition results in a holistic view of real estate in a client’s total operations, including labour, total supply-chain costs, and ESG in order to optimise their total cost of occupancy. CTP ac- commodates this by: • improving efficiency in I&L networks, thanks to its strategically located parks and flexible building lay- outs, which also allow clients to expand at their exist- ing locations; • supporting increased ESG requirements focused on sustainable supply chains and providing amenities/ services to attract and retain local workers; • developing properties with renewable energy sources that also bolster energy security, which is especially important when client operations are highly automat- ed; and • guaranteeing flexibility and speed through estab- lished in-house teams and scale to expand throughout the CTPark Network. With its business model and strategy, CTP is well posi- tioned to capitalise on market opportunities and accom- modate changing client requirements. This is reflected in the Company’s high repeat business, as approximately two-thirds of all new leases signed each year are with ex- isting clients. The CTPark Network—where most of the Group’s construction takes place—supports positive net- work effects for all stakeholders: Clients by providing the opportunity to expand at the same location or elsewhere with- in the CTPark Network, improved in- frastructure, the exchange of expertise and services between clients, and scale to have access to services and amen- ities for their employees that are not feasible for stand-alone units; Communities by providing access to services offered at parks and investments in public transport and green areas; and CTP by enabling market leadership, efficien- cy, and growth with existing clients, allowing for industry-leading returns.

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Strategy & Outlook 30 2.3 Outlook for 2025 Leasing dynamics remain strong, with robust occupier demand, and decreasing new supply leading to continued rental growth. CTP is well positioned to benefit from these trends. The Group’s pipeline is highly profitable, and tenant led. The YoC for CTP’s pipeline increased to 10.3%, thanks to decreasing construction costs and rental growth. The next stage of growth is built in and financed, with 1.8 million sqm under construction as at 31 December 2024, with a target to deliver between 1.2 million sqm–1.7 million sqm in 2025. CTP’s robust capital structure, disciplined financial policy, strong credit market access, industry-leading landbank, in-house construction expertise, and deep tenant relations allow the Company to deliver on its targets. CTP expects to reach €1.0 billion rental income in 2027, driven by development completions, indexation and reversion, and is on track to reach 20 million sqm of GLA and €1.2 billion rental income before the end of the decade. The Group sets a guidance of €0.86–€0.88 Compa- ny-specific adjusted EPRA EPS for 2025. This is driven by strong underlying growth, with around 4% like-for- like growth, partly offset by a higher average cost of debt due to the (re)-financing in 2024 and 2025."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 33 3.1 Overview of Business Environment & Trends CTP operates in ten European countries, from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The Group’s core business, the CTPark Network, services companies active in the industrial & logistics (“I&L”) sector. CTP is also focused on developing and operating advanced high-tech parks in conjunction with local universities and municipalities. The majority of CTP’s standing portfolio is in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”), with the remainder in Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. In general, CEE markets remain undersupplied and are growing faster than Western European markets. The major trends driving the development and growth of the I&L sector across Europe relate to recent and ongo- ing changes to the international geopolitical landscape, with companies focusing on supply chain resiliency and energy security, among others. This has led the emer- gence of nearshoring strategies, particularly in the high- tech manufacturing and ICT sectors, with a “made in Europe, for Europe” focus. The push toward ESG compli- ance and the need to decarbonise supply chains are also driving change. Western Europe remains a highly attractive destina- tion for foreign investors due to its mature and estab- lished markets, which offer stability and reliability. While the region boasts a long history of excellence in manu- facturing and technology, and world-renowned academ- ic institutions, Western European economies are in the midst of re-invention. They are are being transformed by emerging new industries, and previous more energy- and labour-intensive industries are being displaced or disap- pearing. CEE remains the business-smart choice for a wide range of activities, from high-tech manufacturing and R&D to logistics and e-commerce. With its mix of strate- gic location, developed infrastructure, skilled workforce, and overall lower operational costs, CEE is emerging as a “hotspot” for the deployment of European nearshoring strategies. Market maturity varies from country to coun- try, but CEE overall offers more opportunity for green- field investments than Western European markets. The European Union (“EU”) continues to make largescale investments to further develop transport infrastructure, with a focus on CEE. Investment incentives from the Member States are available for qualifying projects, par- ticularly in high-tech. 3.1.1 Economic situation and outlook in CEE Since 2008, CEE economies have consistently outper- formed other European regions and are expected to maintain this trend in the near term (Fig. 3.1). The mac- roeconomic outlook for CEE economies remains strong. After hitting a low point in 2023, economic growth has rebounded, driven by domestic demand fuelled by disin- flation, wage increases, and relaxed fiscal policies. On average, the GDP of CEE economies are expected to have a compounded annual growth (“CAGR”) of 2.2% between 2024–2029 (Fig. 3.1). S&P Global Ratings an- ticipates that CEE GDP growth will also benefit from robust foreign direct investment and substantial EU fund inflows. These factors are expected to more than cover any modest current account deficits, following the region’s significant external adjustment after the 2022 energy price shock. Germany, the largest economy in Europe with a real GDP of €3.617 billion in 2023, is projected to maintain its leading position in the next few decades, although its share of the EU’s total real GDP is expected to decrease slightly, from 21% to 20%. In terms of private consump- tion and total real household disposable income, Germany significantly outpaces the rest of Europe."

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. The type of buildings CTP constructs, mostly light indus- trial and logistics buildings, have an expected average du- rability of 50–60 years, in line with the industry average.

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Strategy & Outlook 30 2.3 Outlook for 2025 Leasing dynamics remain strong, with robust occupier demand, and decreasing new supply leading to continued rental growth. CTP is well positioned to benefit from these trends. The Group’s pipeline is highly profitable, and tenant led. The YoC for CTP’s pipeline increased to 10.3%, thanks to decreasing construction costs and rental growth. The next stage of growth is built in and financed, with 1.8 million sqm under construction as at 31 December 2024, with a target to deliver between 1.2 million sqm–1.7 million sqm in 2025. CTP’s robust capital structure, disciplined financial policy, strong credit market access, industry-leading landbank, in-house construction expertise, and deep tenant relations allow the Company to deliver on its targets. CTP expects to reach €1.0 billion rental income in 2027, driven by development completions, indexation and reversion, and is on track to reach 20 million sqm of GLA and €1.2 billion rental income before the end of the decade. The Group sets a guidance of €0.86–€0.88 Compa- ny-specific adjusted EPRA EPS for 2025. This is driven by strong underlying growth, with around 4% like-for- like growth, partly offset by a higher average cost of debt due to the (re)-financing in 2024 and 2025."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 33 3.1 Overview of Business Environment & Trends CTP operates in ten European countries, from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The Group’s core business, the CTPark Network, services companies active in the industrial & logistics (“I&L”) sector. CTP is also focused on developing and operating advanced high-tech parks in conjunction with local universities and municipalities. The majority of CTP’s standing portfolio is in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”), with the remainder in Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. In general, CEE markets remain undersupplied and are growing faster than Western European markets. The major trends driving the development and growth of the I&L sector across Europe relate to recent and ongo- ing changes to the international geopolitical landscape, with companies focusing on supply chain resiliency and energy security, among others. This has led the emer- gence of nearshoring strategies, particularly in the high- tech manufacturing and ICT sectors, with a “made in Europe, for Europe” focus. The push toward ESG compli- ance and the need to decarbonise supply chains are also driving change. Western Europe remains a highly attractive destina- tion for foreign investors due to its mature and estab- lished markets, which offer stability and reliability. While the region boasts a long history of excellence in manu- facturing and technology, and world-renowned academ- ic institutions, Western European economies are in the midst of re-invention. They are are being transformed by emerging new industries, and previous more energy- and labour-intensive industries are being displaced or disap- pearing. CEE remains the business-smart choice for a wide range of activities, from high-tech manufacturing and R&D to logistics and e-commerce. With its mix of strate- gic location, developed infrastructure, skilled workforce, and overall lower operational costs, CEE is emerging as a “hotspot” for the deployment of European nearshoring strategies. Market maturity varies from country to coun- try, but CEE overall offers more opportunity for green- field investments than Western European markets. The European Union (“EU”) continues to make largescale investments to further develop transport infrastructure, with a focus on CEE. Investment incentives from the Member States are available for qualifying projects, par- ticularly in high-tech. 3.1.1 Economic situation and outlook in CEE Since 2008, CEE economies have consistently outper- formed other European regions and are expected to maintain this trend in the near term (Fig. 3.1). The mac- roeconomic outlook for CEE economies remains strong. After hitting a low point in 2023, economic growth has rebounded, driven by domestic demand fuelled by disin- flation, wage increases, and relaxed fiscal policies. On average, the GDP of CEE economies are expected to have a compounded annual growth (“CAGR”) of 2.2% between 2024–2029 (Fig. 3.1). S&P Global Ratings an- ticipates that CEE GDP growth will also benefit from robust foreign direct investment and substantial EU fund inflows. These factors are expected to more than cover any modest current account deficits, following the region’s significant external adjustment after the 2022 energy price shock. Germany, the largest economy in Europe with a real GDP of €3.617 billion in 2023, is projected to maintain its leading position in the next few decades, although its share of the EU’s total real GDP is expected to decrease slightly, from 21% to 20%. In terms of private consump- tion and total real household disposable income, Germany significantly outpaces the rest of Europe."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 34 3.1.2 Main trends in Europe’s I&L Sector The resiliency of Europe’s industrial & logistics sector is supported by multiple demand drivers and elevated bar- riers to new supply, which include land scarcity and in- creased regulations. Drivers of demand are diverse and include the ongoing trend of nearshoring and the contin- ued growth of e-commerce, where CEE markets in gen- eral offer lower costs and larger growth opportunities. Diverse demand and undersupplied markets in CEE help isolate market volatility. Nearshoring is the sustainable solution for clients to mitigate market volatility The ongoing trend of companies nearshoring manufac- turing and supply chains to be closer to final customers continued at pace in 2024, driving growth in Europe’s I&L sector and for CTP. Companies doing business in Europe are increasing- ly deploying “made in Europe, for Europe” nearshoring strategies to mitigate the risk of disruptions to global supply chains, with a large number of these companies choosing CEE to set up shop. Another reason to prioritise nearshoring is the ac- celerated wage growth in traditionally low-cost Asian manufacturing markets. Nearshoring can also reduce the carbon footprint of supply chains. CEE is the “business-smart” location for European nearshoring strategies The deployment of European nearshoring, near-sourcing, and friendshoring strategies to CEE is on the rise, thanks to the region’s strategic geographic position, which offers cost-effective access to the entire European market. CEE’s business-smart benefits include modern logis- tics infrastructure and connectivity, with major trans- portation hubs close to Europe’s largest markets with high purchasing power. The region also boasts high-tech manufacturing capabilities in locations close to univer- sity cities with access to a highly skilled and motivated workforce. Favourable labour costs further contribute to cost-effective operations. On average, net labour costs (including taxes minus subsidies) in the I&L sector in CEE are more than one-third of those incurred in Western Eu- rope (Fig. 3.3). In general, CEE markets offer business-friendly en- vironments, along with favourable personal tax regimes supporting rising consumer incomes and spending. (Fig. 3.4). CEE’s favourability is reflected in multiple surveys, including the 2023 sourcing strategy report by Maersk. For European companies, three of the top ten countries across the globe for nearshoring are in CEE. In addition to Poland, which heads the list, the ranking includes Ro- mania and the Czech Republic. Stable business environments in Western Europe While CEE countries like Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania offer competitive labour costs and growing markets—mature and established Western European markets, such as Germany, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of sta- bility and highly-skilled talent. Growth of high-tech in CEE CEE has emerged in recent years as a vibrant tech hot- spot, particularly in software development, ICT, and data management. Countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Romania are at the forefront, with a high number of startups and established enterprises driving the region’s tech growth. As part of the ongoing nearshoring trend, several big-ticket investments in advanced tech are heading to the CEE region. TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker, recently announced plans to build its first European chip fabrication plant (or “fab”) in Dresden via a joint venture with German tech majors Infineon, Bosch, and NXP. Total investment is expected to reach €10 billion. US chip giant Intel has also announced plans to invest over $20 billion to build its first fabs in Europe—one in Saxony Germany, and the other across the border in Wrocław, Poland."

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 124 4.7.1.2 ESRS E5 – Material Resource Use and Circular Economy 4.7.1.2.1 Material IROs relating to material resource use and circular economy E5-IRO-1-11 As part of the 2024 DMA, material resource use and cir- cular economy (ESRS E5) was identified as a material top- ic, applicable to all business units and assets considering the development, construction, and operational phases of these assets. The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website. CTP also has internal waste management require- ments, which include requirements for new construction and refurbishments. CTP has yet to develop policies related to resource inflows."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings.

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 33 3.1 Overview of Business Environment & Trends CTP operates in ten European countries, from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The Group’s core business, the CTPark Network, services companies active in the industrial & logistics (“I&L”) sector. CTP is also focused on developing and operating advanced high-tech parks in conjunction with local universities and municipalities. The majority of CTP’s standing portfolio is in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”), with the remainder in Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. In general, CEE markets remain undersupplied and are growing faster than Western European markets. The major trends driving the development and growth of the I&L sector across Europe relate to recent and ongo- ing changes to the international geopolitical landscape, with companies focusing on supply chain resiliency and energy security, among others. This has led the emer- gence of nearshoring strategies, particularly in the high- tech manufacturing and ICT sectors, with a “made in Europe, for Europe” focus. The push toward ESG compli- ance and the need to decarbonise supply chains are also driving change. Western Europe remains a highly attractive destina- tion for foreign investors due to its mature and estab- lished markets, which offer stability and reliability. While the region boasts a long history of excellence in manu- facturing and technology, and world-renowned academ- ic institutions, Western European economies are in the midst of re-invention. They are are being transformed by emerging new industries, and previous more energy- and labour-intensive industries are being displaced or disap- pearing. CEE remains the business-smart choice for a wide range of activities, from high-tech manufacturing and R&D to logistics and e-commerce. With its mix of strate- gic location, developed infrastructure, skilled workforce, and overall lower operational costs, CEE is emerging as a “hotspot” for the deployment of European nearshoring strategies. Market maturity varies from country to coun- try, but CEE overall offers more opportunity for green- field investments than Western European markets. The European Union (“EU”) continues to make largescale investments to further develop transport infrastructure, with a focus on CEE. Investment incentives from the Member States are available for qualifying projects, par- ticularly in high-tech. 3.1.1 Economic situation and outlook in CEE Since 2008, CEE economies have consistently outper- formed other European regions and are expected to maintain this trend in the near term (Fig. 3.1). The mac- roeconomic outlook for CEE economies remains strong. After hitting a low point in 2023, economic growth has rebounded, driven by domestic demand fuelled by disin- flation, wage increases, and relaxed fiscal policies. On average, the GDP of CEE economies are expected to have a compounded annual growth (“CAGR”) of 2.2% between 2024–2029 (Fig. 3.1). S&P Global Ratings an- ticipates that CEE GDP growth will also benefit from robust foreign direct investment and substantial EU fund inflows. These factors are expected to more than cover any modest current account deficits, following the region’s significant external adjustment after the 2022 energy price shock. Germany, the largest economy in Europe with a real GDP of €3.617 billion in 2023, is projected to maintain its leading position in the next few decades, although its share of the EU’s total real GDP is expected to decrease slightly, from 21% to 20%. In terms of private consump- tion and total real household disposable income, Germany significantly outpaces the rest of Europe."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 34 3.1.2 Main trends in Europe’s I&L Sector The resiliency of Europe’s industrial & logistics sector is supported by multiple demand drivers and elevated bar- riers to new supply, which include land scarcity and in- creased regulations. Drivers of demand are diverse and include the ongoing trend of nearshoring and the contin- ued growth of e-commerce, where CEE markets in gen- eral offer lower costs and larger growth opportunities. Diverse demand and undersupplied markets in CEE help isolate market volatility. Nearshoring is the sustainable solution for clients to mitigate market volatility The ongoing trend of companies nearshoring manufac- turing and supply chains to be closer to final customers continued at pace in 2024, driving growth in Europe’s I&L sector and for CTP. Companies doing business in Europe are increasing- ly deploying “made in Europe, for Europe” nearshoring strategies to mitigate the risk of disruptions to global supply chains, with a large number of these companies choosing CEE to set up shop. Another reason to prioritise nearshoring is the ac- celerated wage growth in traditionally low-cost Asian manufacturing markets. Nearshoring can also reduce the carbon footprint of supply chains. CEE is the “business-smart” location for European nearshoring strategies The deployment of European nearshoring, near-sourcing, and friendshoring strategies to CEE is on the rise, thanks to the region’s strategic geographic position, which offers cost-effective access to the entire European market. CEE’s business-smart benefits include modern logis- tics infrastructure and connectivity, with major trans- portation hubs close to Europe’s largest markets with high purchasing power. The region also boasts high-tech manufacturing capabilities in locations close to univer- sity cities with access to a highly skilled and motivated workforce. Favourable labour costs further contribute to cost-effective operations. On average, net labour costs (including taxes minus subsidies) in the I&L sector in CEE are more than one-third of those incurred in Western Eu- rope (Fig. 3.3). In general, CEE markets offer business-friendly en- vironments, along with favourable personal tax regimes supporting rising consumer incomes and spending. (Fig. 3.4). CEE’s favourability is reflected in multiple surveys, including the 2023 sourcing strategy report by Maersk. For European companies, three of the top ten countries across the globe for nearshoring are in CEE. In addition to Poland, which heads the list, the ranking includes Ro- mania and the Czech Republic. Stable business environments in Western Europe While CEE countries like Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania offer competitive labour costs and growing markets—mature and established Western European markets, such as Germany, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of sta- bility and highly-skilled talent. Growth of high-tech in CEE CEE has emerged in recent years as a vibrant tech hot- spot, particularly in software development, ICT, and data management. Countries like Poland, the Czech Republic, and Romania are at the forefront, with a high number of startups and established enterprises driving the region’s tech growth. As part of the ongoing nearshoring trend, several big-ticket investments in advanced tech are heading to the CEE region. TSMC, the world’s largest chipmaker, recently announced plans to build its first European chip fabrication plant (or “fab”) in Dresden via a joint venture with German tech majors Infineon, Bosch, and NXP. Total investment is expected to reach €10 billion. US chip giant Intel has also announced plans to invest over $20 billion to build its first fabs in Europe—one in Saxony Germany, and the other across the border in Wrocław, Poland."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 35 E-commerce in CEE is maturing, resulting in diverse demand and continued long-term growth E-commerce revenue across CEE has grown consistently over the last few years. In general, the CEE region com- pares favourably with Western Europe in terms of the cumulative percentage growth of e-commerce revenue. Cumulative and projected e-commerce revenue growth from 2018–2029 indicates that CEE continues to outpace the EU-27, with a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 10%, compared to Western Europe’s CAGR of 8% (Fig. 3.2). Professionalisation of CEE supply chains The CEE region’s integration into global supply chains has positioned it as a hub for manufacturing, logistics, and high-value-added industries, reinforcing its signifi- cance to the European and global economies. Combined with the growth of CEE consumer markets, this has led to the professionalisation of supply chains across the region and across industries, with third-party logistics providers (3PLs) handling the full range of supply-chain management and deliveries. Infrastructure investments in Europe Europe is receiving substantial infrastructure invest- ments from both public and private sectors, targeting areas such as transport, energy, and digital services. The EU has allocated approximately €392 billion to its Cohe- sion Policy during the 2021–2027 period. In July 2024, the European Commission selected 134 transport projects to receive over €7 billion in EU grants from the Connecting Europe Facility. The Three Seas Initiative addresses the infrastructure gap between CEE and Western Europe by driving investments in energy, digital technology, and transport. Long-term trend of diverse demand and undersupplied markets isolates market volatility CTP’s client base is diverse, particularly in CEE markets, given the higher share of final assembly and manufactur- ing services. This diverse demand is taking place in a market that is tight, as vacancy across Europe is below long-term av- erages. I&L in CEE is undersupplied, as the sector is a relatively young asset class compared to other commer- cial real estate. Undersupplied markets create struc- tural demand, as clients continue to upgrade to modern grade-A stock. Growth markets in CEE, such as Bulgaria and Serbia, have less than 0.25 sqm of grade-A stock per capita, which places them among the most under- supplied markets in Europe. These undersupplied mar- kets are catching up, fuelling demand as they move clos- er to European averages. Elevated supply barriers due to land scarcity and rising regulatory requirements create structural constraints Barriers to new supply are expected to rise in years to come. This mitigates the risk of potential oversupply and is expected to keep market vacancy rates at low levels. Land is scarce in more mature markets such as Germany, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. Supply barriers are rising in other CEE markets as well, particularly at sites close to key economic clusters. The second driver of constraints are rising regulatory requirements. Ob- taining permits to (re)develop requires more time, de- laying future new supply. Long and expanding regulatory requirements is a trend seen across Europe but is most visible in markets with the tightest supply, such as the Czech Republic. Permitting timelines are expanding for multiple reasons, including lack of staff at public author- ities and/or stricter requirements. As supply barriers are rising, today’s infill markets are expected to become ultra-infill in the future. Therefore, supply barriers are also expected to be a driver of future rent growth per- formance."

These include manufacturing (high-tech/IT, automotive) and e-commerce, retail, wholesale, and third-party logis- tics. CTP’s client roster of over 1,000 companies repre- sents a solid balance between diversification and con- centration for the Group, with no single client accounting for more than 2.5% of its annual rent roll. A diversity of clients and industries are critical to build a resilient, fu- ture-proof portfolio. Warehousing & logistics is a key sector for CTP, and 3PLs, who may serve one or more clients at a specific location. They are in particular focused on strategic lo- cations to optimise their operations. Many clients in this category are international players, which provide oppor- tunities to cross-sell across markets and countries. Retail is a growing segment for CTP, as retailers have started looking more to CEE markets, driven by an emerg- ing middle class, higher growth of disposable income and faster pace of e-commerce growth in the region. Manufacturing is strongly represented in CTP’s port- folio, particularly high-tech activities, with clients gener- ally signing longer leases as relocating is costly and cap- ital intensive. CTP expects strong demand as a result of the ongoing nearshoring trend. Automotive is also strongly represented in CTP’s portfolio due to the large clusters of manufacturers mov- ing to the lower-cost but educated workforce that CEE offers. The growing trend to develop new electric vehicle (""EV"") innovations is expected to generate more demand in markets offering significant available workforce and technical education, government incentives, and proxim- ity to suppliers.

For category 6 data is available within the organisation, and therefore it is reported. Scope 3 categories 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15, are not significant to CTP’s business operations based on the size of the emission. CTP’s GHG intensity is calculated using the emis- sions of Scope 1 and 2, divided by the net revenue of 2024. A negligible percentage of net revenue was obtained from non-high-climate impact sectors; therefore, this revenue is included in the calculation. The denominator for GHG intensity is total revenue. In addition to the assurance provider, reported data in this section (energy consumption, refrigerant losses, and respective GHG emissions excluding intensities) is vali- dated by Arcadis in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2019. The process includes review of a sample and review against underlying evidence, verifying the correctness of the calculations and results. The GHG intensity reduction from 2023 to 2024 is driven mostly by an increase in net revenue Scope 3 category 1 was calculated using available data for completed buildings. The emission intensities have been determined on the country level. These intensities were used as the basis on which to calculate the reported figures for 2024 multiplying the intensities by the GLA (sqm) of completed buildings in each country in 2024. CTP’s emissions are not regulated under the Europe- an Union Emissions Trading System. There were no significant changes in 2024 to the definition of what constitutes CTP and its upstream and downstream value chain. Within its Scope 3 emissions, CTP has included the following categories: Category 1 Purchased goods and services Category 6 Business travel Category 13 Downstream leased assets"
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 123 4.7.1.1.8 Financial effects of climate IROs E1-9-66, E1-9-67, E1-9-68, E1-9-69, SBM-3-48, E1-IRO-1-20 In 2022, as a part of overall risk management, CTP con- ducted its first physical climate risk assessment to evalu- ate the exposure of its properties to acute and chronic cli- mate-related risks using a third-party climate modelling tool. The assessment was expanded in 2023 and 2024 to cover properties acquired and developed since 2022. In this assessment, the Company used different RCP models made available by the IPCC, considering items such as, but not limited to, coastal flooding, extreme heat, and water stress. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. The climate-related risks identified as potentially the most impactful to CTP are coastal flooding and rising sea levels. These have been categorised into short-, mid-, and long-term risks. Even in the least severe scenarios (SSP2, medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation), projections indicate that sea levels will rise significantly enough that, in the long term, the Company’s portfolio in the Netherlands could be affected, with some assets po- tentially falling below sea level. This is similarly true for a limited number of properties along the German Wadden Sea coast. However, CTP regards these risks as policy risks, given that both Dutch and German governments are implementing measures to mitigate them. Based on its analysis, CTP concludes that five of its properties1 are at risk, representing, at most, 1.2% of the portfolio’s value. As part of the climate risk assessment mentioned above, transition climate risks were also examined. CTP utilised the CRREM tool developed by the Carbon Risk Real Es- tate Monitor to evaluate which buildings might need ad- ditional investment to increase energy efficiency in order to meet anticipated regulatory requirements. However, given that CTP buildings support a variety of uses, even within a CRREM category, the Company ac- knowledges limitations to the applicability of the CRREM tool on its portfolio. Client energy consumption is includ- ed in the analysis and can vary significantly depending on the client’s industry. For instance, the size of the cold storage area within a warehouse is not considered as an input, although it significantly influences the building’s energy consumption and thus affects the outcome of the assessment. With the expected impacts of the EU’s En- ergy Performance Buildings Directive (“EPBD”), which was revised in 2024, CTP considers other aspects such as the Energy Performance Certificate (“EPC”) to be more accurate indicators of the energy efficiency of its buildings. CRREM was used as a testing and indication tool, while EPCs were used for a more precise assessment of transition climate risks. CTP continuously upgrades its portfolio to ensure that it retains its high energy clas- sifications. Construction of new buildings follows up-to- date requirements and CTP’s internal ESG requirements, which in many cases go beyond local building code re- quirements. Expected costs related to material and tran- sition climate risks have been calculated for a sample of properties, the outcome of which is presented in Section 4.7.1.1.1. The impact of the both physical and transition related cli- mate risks is expressed in the property values, as these go through a bi-annual evaluation process. CTP uses re- nowned valuators to ensure all climate-related aspects are taking into account. Additionally, properties are in- sured. Therefore, CTP considers expected costs as part of business as usual. CTP has not identified transition risks that are financially material to the portfolio over the short and medium term. Additionally, the long-term impact of physical cli- mate risks is presented in the paragraphs above, while the long-term impact of transition risks is considered as too volatile to be reliable. The volatility of energy prices in Europe in recent years have made CTP’s clients more aware of the short- and long-term costs of energy. There was a visible increase in client demand for energy from renewable sources during 2024. CTP expects its abili- ty to provide clients with renewable energy generated onsite at its parks, as well as other energy-efficiency measures that the Company takes, to attract more com- panies that consider total cost of occupancy as a main driver. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. CTP is a dynamic company with continuous growth through construction and acquisitions. The consistent arrival of new clients and ongoing changes to their oper- ations affect the consumption of utilities within the port- folio. This makes the creation of metrics difficult and re- quires more detailed analysis. Despite these limitations, CTP carried out an analysis of its clients, which confirms that none of its clients operate in the coal, oil, or gas- related sectors. 1 Properties located in NUTS Code areas NL3, DE8, and DE9."

The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website. CTP also has internal waste management require- ments, which include requirements for new construction and refurbishments. CTP has yet to develop policies related to resource inflows."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings. These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations.

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. The type of buildings CTP constructs, mostly light indus- trial and logistics buildings, have an expected average du- rability of 50–60 years, in line with the industry average. Beyond CTP’s assurance provider, no other validation took place. 4.7.1.2.6 Financial effects of IROs relating to resource use and circular economy E5-6-41, E5-6-43 CTP’s 2024 DMA process did not identify any risks or op- portunities related to circular economy; therefore, CTP does not foresee a financial impact.

CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 127 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."

CTP’s four Core markets—the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia—represent almost 73% of the Group’s total owned GLA. CTP’s average market share in those markets stood at 28.8% as at 31 Decem- ber 2024, and the Group remains the largest owner and developer of industrial and logistics real estate assets in each Core market. The Group is also the market leader in Serbia and Bulgaria. With over 1,000 clients, CTP has a wide and diversified international client base, consisting of blue-chip compa- nies with strong credit ratings. CTP’s clients represent a broad range of industries, including manufacturing, high- tech/IT, automotive, and e-commerce, retail, wholesale, and third-party logistics. This client base is highly di- versified, with no single client accounting for more than 2.5% of its annual rent roll, which leads to a stable income stream. CTP’s top 50 clients only account for 35.2% of its rent roll and most are in multiple CTPark locations."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 41 3.2.2 Standing portfolio CTP develops, owns and manages a high-quality portfo- lio of assets in over 250 locations. The Group increased its investment portfolio from 11.8 million sqm of owned GLA in 2023 to 13.3 million sqm at end-2024. Growth was mainly organic, with deliveries of 1.3 million sqm and the acquisition of 0.3 million sqm of value-add and in- come-producing assets. With its market-leading portfo- lio throughout continental Europe, the Group’s business generates strong cash flows. CTP can realise the highest incremental return with the development of new properties in our CTPark Network, as these are developed in-house, on land that it has already paid for and mostly for existing clients, which is why such deliveries are the main driver of the Company’s growth. The Group’s annualised income increased to €743 million (31 December 2023: €644 million), an increase year-on-year of 15%. An increasing proportion of the rental income gener- ated by CTP’s investment portfolio benefits from infla- tion protection. Since end-2019, all the Group’s new lease agreements include a double indexation clause, which cal- culates annual rental increases as the higher of: • a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year; or • the Consumer Price Index. As at 31 December 2024, 71% (31 December 2023: 66%) of income generated by the Group’s portfolio includes this double indexation clause, and the Group aims to in- crease this further. The remaining 29% of the portfolio has only a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year, and there- fore more reversionary potential built-in. The indexation takes place on 1 January of each year in the majority of the lease agreements. Therefore, the growth in rental in- come relating to 2024 inflation will only be recorded in the 2025. The Company’s occupancy stood at 93% at year-end (31 December 2023: 94%). CTP targets an occupancy rate around 95% with a few percentage points of va- cancy, as this flexibility is key to optimise client relation- ships and drive rental growth. CTP’s business model and strategy are focused on being a long-term business part- ner, to support existing clients to grow in their existing location or at another park within the CTPark Network. Some of CTP’s clients have already extended more than five times in their existing location. CTP therefore starts some developments before having secured pre-letting; however, this is concentrated in existing parks, where the Company has good visibility on future demand and deep market knowledge. This allows CTP to maintain a mar- ket-leading client retention rate of 87% (31 December 2023: 90%), which demonstrates CTP’s ability to lever- age long-standing client relationships. The rent collection level stabilised at 99.8% (31 De- cember 2023: 99.9%), with no deterioration in the pay- ment profile. In 2024, CTP realised a like-for-like growth of 4.0%, mainly driven by reversion and indexation. Countries with the highest like-for-like rental growth were Slovakia and Poland. The weighted average unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) of CTP’s investment portfolio stood at 6.4 years at the period end (31 December 2023: 6.6 years), in line with the Company’s target of >6 years. The reversionary potential stands at 14.5% as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 14.5%), illustrat- ing the future rental growth potential. The Group has the highest reversionary potential in the Germany with 25.9%. Based on the expiry schedule, the Group is expected to be able to capture more than 28% of the reversionary potential in the coming five years. During 2024, leases, on average, were signed above their estimated rental val- ue (“ERV”), supporting both the Group’s reversionary po- tential and valuations."

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."

CTP’s four Core markets—the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia—represent almost 73% of the Group’s total owned GLA. CTP’s average market share in those markets stood at 28.8% as at 31 Decem- ber 2024, and the Group remains the largest owner and developer of industrial and logistics real estate assets in each Core market. The Group is also the market leader in Serbia and Bulgaria. With over 1,000 clients, CTP has a wide and diversified international client base, consisting of blue-chip compa- nies with strong credit ratings. CTP’s clients represent a broad range of industries, including manufacturing, high- tech/IT, automotive, and e-commerce, retail, wholesale, and third-party logistics. This client base is highly di- versified, with no single client accounting for more than 2.5% of its annual rent roll, which leads to a stable income stream. CTP’s top 50 clients only account for 35.2% of its rent roll and most are in multiple CTPark locations."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 41 3.2.2 Standing portfolio CTP develops, owns and manages a high-quality portfo- lio of assets in over 250 locations. The Group increased its investment portfolio from 11.8 million sqm of owned GLA in 2023 to 13.3 million sqm at end-2024. Growth was mainly organic, with deliveries of 1.3 million sqm and the acquisition of 0.3 million sqm of value-add and in- come-producing assets. With its market-leading portfo- lio throughout continental Europe, the Group’s business generates strong cash flows. CTP can realise the highest incremental return with the development of new properties in our CTPark Network, as these are developed in-house, on land that it has already paid for and mostly for existing clients, which is why such deliveries are the main driver of the Company’s growth. The Group’s annualised income increased to €743 million (31 December 2023: €644 million), an increase year-on-year of 15%. An increasing proportion of the rental income gener- ated by CTP’s investment portfolio benefits from infla- tion protection. Since end-2019, all the Group’s new lease agreements include a double indexation clause, which cal- culates annual rental increases as the higher of: • a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year; or • the Consumer Price Index. As at 31 December 2024, 71% (31 December 2023: 66%) of income generated by the Group’s portfolio includes this double indexation clause, and the Group aims to in- crease this further. The remaining 29% of the portfolio has only a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year, and there- fore more reversionary potential built-in. The indexation takes place on 1 January of each year in the majority of the lease agreements. Therefore, the growth in rental in- come relating to 2024 inflation will only be recorded in the 2025. The Company’s occupancy stood at 93% at year-end (31 December 2023: 94%). CTP targets an occupancy rate around 95% with a few percentage points of va- cancy, as this flexibility is key to optimise client relation- ships and drive rental growth. CTP’s business model and strategy are focused on being a long-term business part- ner, to support existing clients to grow in their existing location or at another park within the CTPark Network. Some of CTP’s clients have already extended more than five times in their existing location. CTP therefore starts some developments before having secured pre-letting; however, this is concentrated in existing parks, where the Company has good visibility on future demand and deep market knowledge. This allows CTP to maintain a mar- ket-leading client retention rate of 87% (31 December 2023: 90%), which demonstrates CTP’s ability to lever- age long-standing client relationships. The rent collection level stabilised at 99.8% (31 De- cember 2023: 99.9%), with no deterioration in the pay- ment profile. In 2024, CTP realised a like-for-like growth of 4.0%, mainly driven by reversion and indexation. Countries with the highest like-for-like rental growth were Slovakia and Poland. The weighted average unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) of CTP’s investment portfolio stood at 6.4 years at the period end (31 December 2023: 6.6 years), in line with the Company’s target of >6 years. The reversionary potential stands at 14.5% as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 14.5%), illustrat- ing the future rental growth potential. The Group has the highest reversionary potential in the Germany with 25.9%. Based on the expiry schedule, the Group is expected to be able to capture more than 28% of the reversionary potential in the coming five years. During 2024, leases, on average, were signed above their estimated rental val- ue (“ERV”), supporting both the Group’s reversionary po- tential and valuations."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 124 4.7.1.2 ESRS E5 – Material Resource Use and Circular Economy 4.7.1.2.1 Material IROs relating to material resource use and circular economy E5-IRO-1-11 As part of the 2024 DMA, material resource use and cir- cular economy (ESRS E5) was identified as a material top- ic, applicable to all business units and assets considering the development, construction, and operational phases of these assets. The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website. CTP also has internal waste management require- ments, which include requirements for new construction and refurbishments. CTP has yet to develop policies related to resource inflows."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings. These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations. CTP is currently collecting data on the inflow of ma- terials, which will enable the creation of informed actions.

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. The type of buildings CTP constructs, mostly light indus- trial and logistics buildings, have an expected average du- rability of 50–60 years, in line with the industry average. Beyond CTP’s assurance provider, no other validation took place. 4.7.1.2.6 Financial effects of IROs relating to resource use and circular economy E5-6-41, E5-6-43 CTP’s 2024 DMA process did not identify any risks or op- portunities related to circular economy; therefore, CTP does not foresee a financial impact. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material topics, including impacts of doing business as usual."

Since end-2019, all the Group’s new lease agreements include a double indexation clause, which cal- culates annual rental increases as the higher of: • a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year; or • the Consumer Price Index. As at 31 December 2024, 71% (31 December 2023: 66%) of income generated by the Group’s portfolio includes this double indexation clause, and the Group aims to in- crease this further. The remaining 29% of the portfolio has only a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year, and there- fore more reversionary potential built-in. The indexation takes place on 1 January of each year in the majority of the lease agreements. Therefore, the growth in rental in- come relating to 2024 inflation will only be recorded in the 2025. The Company’s occupancy stood at 93% at year-end (31 December 2023: 94%). CTP targets an occupancy rate around 95% with a few percentage points of va- cancy, as this flexibility is key to optimise client relation- ships and drive rental growth. CTP’s business model and strategy are focused on being a long-term business part- ner, to support existing clients to grow in their existing location or at another park within the CTPark Network. Some of CTP’s clients have already extended more than five times in their existing location. CTP therefore starts some developments before having secured pre-letting; however, this is concentrated in existing parks, where the Company has good visibility on future demand and deep market knowledge. This allows CTP to maintain a mar- ket-leading client retention rate of 87% (31 December 2023: 90%), which demonstrates CTP’s ability to lever- age long-standing client relationships. The rent collection level stabilised at 99.8% (31 De- cember 2023: 99.9%), with no deterioration in the pay- ment profile. In 2024, CTP realised a like-for-like growth of 4.0%, mainly driven by reversion and indexation. Countries with the highest like-for-like rental growth were Slovakia and Poland. The weighted average unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) of CTP’s investment portfolio stood at 6.4 years at the period end (31 December 2023: 6.6 years), in line with the Company’s target of >6 years. The reversionary potential stands at 14.5% as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 14.5%), illustrat- ing the future rental growth potential. The Group has the highest reversionary potential in the Germany with 25.9%. Based on the expiry schedule, the Group is expected to be able to capture more than 28% of the reversionary potential in the coming five years. During 2024, leases, on average, were signed above their estimated rental val- ue (“ERV”), supporting both the Group’s reversionary po- tential and valuations."

The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website. CTP also has internal waste management require- ments, which include requirements for new construction and refurbishments. CTP has yet to develop policies related to resource inflows."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings. These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations. CTP is currently collecting data on the inflow of ma- terials, which will enable the creation of informed actions.

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. The type of buildings CTP constructs, mostly light indus- trial and logistics buildings, have an expected average du- rability of 50–60 years, in line with the industry average. Beyond CTP’s assurance provider, no other validation took place. 4.7.1.2.6 Financial effects of IROs relating to resource use and circular economy E5-6-41, E5-6-43 CTP’s 2024 DMA process did not identify any risks or op- portunities related to circular economy; therefore, CTP does not foresee a financial impact. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material topics, including impacts of doing business as usual."
CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 127 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."

For category 6 data is available within the organisation, and therefore it is reported. Scope 3 categories 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15, are not significant to CTP’s business operations based on the size of the emission. CTP’s GHG intensity is calculated using the emis- sions of Scope 1 and 2, divided by the net revenue of 2024. A negligible percentage of net revenue was obtained from non-high-climate impact sectors; therefore, this revenue is included in the calculation. The denominator for GHG intensity is total revenue. In addition to the assurance provider, reported data in this section (energy consumption, refrigerant losses, and respective GHG emissions excluding intensities) is vali- dated by Arcadis in accordance with ISO 14064-3:2019. The process includes review of a sample and review against underlying evidence, verifying the correctness of the calculations and results. The GHG intensity reduction from 2023 to 2024 is driven mostly by an increase in net revenue Scope 3 category 1 was calculated using available data for completed buildings. The emission intensities have been determined on the country level. These intensities were used as the basis on which to calculate the reported figures for 2024 multiplying the intensities by the GLA (sqm) of completed buildings in each country in 2024. CTP’s emissions are not regulated under the Europe- an Union Emissions Trading System. There were no significant changes in 2024 to the definition of what constitutes CTP and its upstream and downstream value chain. Within its Scope 3 emissions, CTP has included the following categories: Category 1 Purchased goods and services Category 6 Business travel Category 13 Downstream leased assets"
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 123 4.7.1.1.8 Financial effects of climate IROs E1-9-66, E1-9-67, E1-9-68, E1-9-69, SBM-3-48, E1-IRO-1-20 In 2022, as a part of overall risk management, CTP con- ducted its first physical climate risk assessment to evalu- ate the exposure of its properties to acute and chronic cli- mate-related risks using a third-party climate modelling tool. The assessment was expanded in 2023 and 2024 to cover properties acquired and developed since 2022. In this assessment, the Company used different RCP models made available by the IPCC, considering items such as, but not limited to, coastal flooding, extreme heat, and water stress. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. The climate-related risks identified as potentially the most impactful to CTP are coastal flooding and rising sea levels. These have been categorised into short-, mid-, and long-term risks. Even in the least severe scenarios (SSP2, medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation), projections indicate that sea levels will rise significantly enough that, in the long term, the Company’s portfolio in the Netherlands could be affected, with some assets po- tentially falling below sea level. This is similarly true for a limited number of properties along the German Wadden Sea coast. However, CTP regards these risks as policy risks, given that both Dutch and German governments are implementing measures to mitigate them. Based on its analysis, CTP concludes that five of its properties1 are at risk, representing, at most, 1.2% of the portfolio’s value. As part of the climate risk assessment mentioned above, transition climate risks were also examined. CTP utilised the CRREM tool developed by the Carbon Risk Real Es- tate Monitor to evaluate which buildings might need ad- ditional investment to increase energy efficiency in order to meet anticipated regulatory requirements. However, given that CTP buildings support a variety of uses, even within a CRREM category, the Company ac- knowledges limitations to the applicability of the CRREM tool on its portfolio. Client energy consumption is includ- ed in the analysis and can vary significantly depending on the client’s industry. For instance, the size of the cold storage area within a warehouse is not considered as an input, although it significantly influences the building’s energy consumption and thus affects the outcome of the assessment. With the expected impacts of the EU’s En- ergy Performance Buildings Directive (“EPBD”), which was revised in 2024, CTP considers other aspects such as the Energy Performance Certificate (“EPC”) to be more accurate indicators of the energy efficiency of its buildings. CRREM was used as a testing and indication tool, while EPCs were used for a more precise assessment of transition climate risks. CTP continuously upgrades its portfolio to ensure that it retains its high energy clas- sifications. Construction of new buildings follows up-to- date requirements and CTP’s internal ESG requirements, which in many cases go beyond local building code re- quirements. Expected costs related to material and tran- sition climate risks have been calculated for a sample of properties, the outcome of which is presented in Section 4.7.1.1.1. The impact of the both physical and transition related cli- mate risks is expressed in the property values, as these go through a bi-annual evaluation process. CTP uses re- nowned valuators to ensure all climate-related aspects are taking into account. Additionally, properties are in- sured. Therefore, CTP considers expected costs as part of business as usual. CTP has not identified transition risks that are financially material to the portfolio over the short and medium term. Additionally, the long-term impact of physical cli- mate risks is presented in the paragraphs above, while the long-term impact of transition risks is considered as too volatile to be reliable. The volatility of energy prices in Europe in recent years have made CTP’s clients more aware of the short- and long-term costs of energy. There was a visible increase in client demand for energy from renewable sources during 2024. CTP expects its abili- ty to provide clients with renewable energy generated onsite at its parks, as well as other energy-efficiency measures that the Company takes, to attract more com- panies that consider total cost of occupancy as a main driver. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. CTP is a dynamic company with continuous growth through construction and acquisitions. The consistent arrival of new clients and ongoing changes to their oper- ations affect the consumption of utilities within the port- folio. This makes the creation of metrics difficult and re- quires more detailed analysis. Despite these limitations, CTP carried out an analysis of its clients, which confirms that none of its clients operate in the coal, oil, or gas- related sectors. 1 Properties located in NUTS Code areas NL3, DE8, and DE9."

These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations. CTP is currently collecting data on the inflow of ma- terials, which will enable the creation of informed actions.

The base sample includes GFA of 485,277 sqm, whereas CTP com- pleted 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. As part of the BREEAM certification process, CTP received data on materials used in its buildings. As data is delivered in different metrics (cubic metre, sqm, or kg), CTP has made use of the information received in kg to cal- culate the reported numbers. CTP’s material inflow is related to building materials used in the construction process. Among others, impor- tant materials are steel, concrete, asphalt, and the water used in the process. CTP uses these materials as provid- ed by suppliers to construct its buildings. Some materi- als, such as steel and concrete, include recycled content. After completing the building lifecycle, a share of materi- als used in buildings can be reused or recycled. CTP has no available data related to biological materi- als or the weight in both absolute value and percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products, and secondary materials used to manufacture the undertaking’s products and services (in- cluding packaging). The data in the table “Material Outflows” is based on estimates obtained from data that CTP collected on pre- viously completed buildings and extrapolated to cover the GFA completed in 2024. For these estimates, CTP cre- ated a sample of reports related to waste-related data under BREEAM certification. The base sample includes GFA of 489,291 sqm, where- as CTP completed 1,283,570 sqm of GFA in 2024. The sample data does not include a breakdown of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and only information on waste diverted from landfills can be shared. Due to the limit- ed data availability, extrapolation of the sample leads to inaccuracies in the reported figures. Considering the na- ture of CTP’s buildings, no radioactive waste can be ex- pected. The waste streams relevant to the sector in which CTP operates is related to construction materials, such as gypsum, plastics, packaging, and insulation. The na- ture of waste in the construction sector makes it recy- clable to a great extent. The 37% of waste diverted from landfill is underestimated due to limited data availability; improvement of this numbers is possible through better onsite waste management and improved data quality. Currently, the available data informs the percentage of waste diverted from landfill. Due to the nature of the waste, this can be considered as recycled, with the rest being non-recycled. The available data does not inform on whether waste is hazardous or non-hazardous. The type of buildings CTP constructs, mostly light indus- trial and logistics buildings, have an expected average du- rability of 50–60 years, in line with the industry average. Beyond CTP’s assurance provider, no other validation took place. 4.7.1.2.6 Financial effects of IROs relating to resource use and circular economy E5-6-41, E5-6-43 CTP’s 2024 DMA process did not identify any risks or op- portunities related to circular economy; therefore, CTP does not foresee a financial impact. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material topics, including impacts of doing business as usual."
CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 127 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 129 Summary • CTP’s 2024 DMA identified positive impacts on CTP’s own workforce. CTP’s focus on personal health and well-being is demonstrated by providing regular Group-wide events and managing health and safety at the workplace. • For actions leading to positive impacts, see Section 4.7.2.1.6. • No risks or opportunities were identified in relation to dependencies on the workforce. • The growth of CTP’s business creates employment opportunities for new candidates and offers opportu- nities for existing staff. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or com- pulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. • CTP does not see impacts on its employees stemming from material topics E1, E5, S2, and G1. CTP does not see any impact on the IROs arising from the execution of its Transition Plan for Climate Change Mit- igation. 4.7.2.1.3 Policies related to CTP’s workforce S1-1-17, S1-1-19, S1-1-20, S1-1-21, S1-1-22, S1-1-23, S1-1-24, S1-ESRS-2-62 GRI 3-3, GRI 403-1 Multiple CTP policies cover workforce-related material topics. CTP respects human rights and embraces major human rights-related documents and conventions, such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the OECD Guidelines for Multi- national Enterprises, through its policies. These are out- lined below. Code of Conduct CTP’s Code of Conduct covers IROs related to health and safety. This code sets out the expected behaviour of, and therefore applying to, CTP’s Execu- tive Directors and Company staff. The specific topics mentioned in the Code of Conduct are working relationships and workplace safety. CTP’s Executive Direc- tors are accountable for the implementa- tion of the code. CTP’s Code of Conduct has been established in accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and references multiple internation- al conventions as applicable, including the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the ILO core conventions, and the International Bill of Human Rights. The Code of Conduct explicitly prohibits human trafficking, forced labour, and child labour. CTP’s Code of Conduct describes the process in detail and is available on the Company’s website. Diversity and Inclusion Policy CTP’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy cov- ers IROs related to diversity and inclusion within the Company. This policy sets out the rules for diversity and inclusion regarding the composition of the Board and senior management, policy imple- mentation, and annual reporting on its implementation during the year. CTP’s Executive Directors are accountable for implementing the policy. The policy was developed in line with provision 2.1.5 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The policy applies to the Board of Direc- tors and senior management. See Section 5.5 for more details on CTP’s Diversity and Inclusion Policy. Anti-discrimination and Harassment Policy The goal of CTP’s Anti-discrimination and Harassment Policy is to foster safe, equal and inclusive working environments for CTP’s own employees as well as for workers in CTP’s value chain. CTP’s Anti-discrimination and Harassment Pol- icy covers the topic of measures against violence and harassment, including known grounds of discrimination, at the work- place and applies to all CTP employees with an employment contract and to individuals associated with CTP, e.g., agents, guests, customers, vendors, and other third parties. In this way, the policy covers material impacts related to “equal treatment and opportunities for all”. The policy is structured in such a manner that it prevents discrimination and harass- ment, mitigates the risk of occurrence, and has methods of remediation in place. The Executive Directors are accountable for the implementation of the policy. The policy is implemented in accordance with local labour and anti-discrimination leg- islation and other respective regulations, including but not limited to International Labour Organisation (“ILO”) conventions."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 130 All above-mentioned policies are available on CTP’s web- site and cover all employees without being directed at specific groups; there are no specific policy commitments directed towards positive action or for people from groups at risk of vulnarability. Policy commitments relat- ed to inclusion are part of CTP’s Diverstity and Inclusion Policy. Internal and external stakeholders were involved in the setting of these policies. CTP has yet to develop policies that cover social dia- logue, work-life balance, training and development skills, recruitment, and workplace accident prevention. 4.7.2.1.4 Employee engagement S1-2-25, S1-2-27, S1-2-28 To gain better insight into actual or potential impacts, both positive and negative, that may affect CTP’s work- force, the Company includes its own employees as a stakeholder group in the DMA process, which takes place every two years. The Group Head of ESG Management is responsible for this process. Additionally, CTP launched an annual Employee En- gagement Survey in 2024 to gain further understanding of and insights into the level of engagement and satis- faction of its employees. See Section 4.7.2.1.6 for further details. 4.7.2.1.5 Remediation of negative impacts and channels to raise concerns S1-3-30, S1-3-32, S1-3-33, S1-3-34 GRI-2-26 CTP offers its employees multiple, layered channels that enable them to raise concerns about negative impacts. The access to these channels is communicated and made available through CTP’s policies. See Section 4.7.2.1.3 for more information on these policies. These include: • the appropriate supervisor; • a designated Company contact; • the Group AML Compliance Officer (compliance@ctp.eu); • an anonymous grievance channel. Both the reporter and the receiver of the report must fol- low the procedures set out in the Group Grievance Inves- tigation Procedure and the Group Anti-discrimination and Harassment Policy. At CTP, the tracking and monitoring of issues raised through the Company’s grievance channels are managed using the FaceUp website application, which provides re- al-time oversight and detailed reporting capabilities. This system, overseen by the Group AML Compliance Officer, ensures that all concerns are promptly addressed and al- lows for the active involvement of stakeholders in verifying the effectiveness of the grievance mechanisms. Further- more, to ensure continuous improvement and accountabil- ity, a comprehensive report on the handling and resolution of these issues is regularly presented to the Audit Com- mittee/Board, demonstrating the Company’s commit- ment to transparency and effective issue resolution. The grievance channel can be used for all non-compli- ance concerns, including ESG matters. Currently, CTP assess the effectiveness of remediation of negative impacts on a case-by-case basis. An external provider manages the grievance channel to ensure anonymity. CTP’s Whistleblower Policy ensures non-retaliation. The mechanisms CTP uses to ensure familiarity with these channels are described in Section 4.7.3.1.4 as part of CTP’s governance policies. The fact that cases stem from internal reporters shows that em- ployees are aware of and trust the process. 4.7.2.1.6 Actions and resources S1-4-35, S1-4-37, S1-4-38, S1-4-39, S1-4-40, S1-4-41, S1-4-42, S1-4-43 As CTP’s 2024 DMA did not identify negative impacts, no mitigating actions were taken and no actions are planned. The resources allocated to managing material impacts are considered part of normal business operations. The employee Engagement Survey and Employee Share Pur- chase Plan are managed and financed at the Group level. Other actions have budgets available; these are managed locally as part of the business process. The actions executed in 2024 address selected topics and are directed towards collecting data to develop tar- gets, and with those, actions. CTP has also developed the HR function to plan actions to address other IROs. In 2024, CTP initiated two new actions to strengthen employee engagement, and bolster all positive impacts:"
