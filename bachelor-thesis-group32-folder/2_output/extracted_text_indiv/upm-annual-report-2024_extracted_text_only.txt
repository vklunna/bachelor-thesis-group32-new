In 2024, the fair value of forest assets in Finland was impacted by higher long term stumpage price estimates. In 2023, the change in fair value of forest assets in Finland was impacted by higher discount rate which was partly offset by higher stumpage price estimates.

At the end of 2024, carrying value of own forest land amounted to EUR 801 million (EUR 715 million) and leased forest land EUR 249 million (EUR 231 million). UPM's own and leased forest land areas are summarised in below table. 1,000 ha FOREST LAND PRO-DUCTIVE FOREST LAND FORESTED LAND Finland 522 428 416 Uruguay 318 189 178 Uruguay, leased land 174 140 130 United States 76 55 55 Total 1,090 812 779 Accounting policies The group divides all its forest assets for accounting purposes into growing forests, which are recognised as forest assets at fair value less costs to sell, and land. The group applies IAS 41 to account its forest assets. Own land is stated at cost whereas leased land is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. Any changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in the operating profit in the income statement. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows considering existing, sustainable harvesting plans and assessments regarding growth, timber prices, harvesting and silviculture costs and selling expenses. Forest renewal costs are capitalised during the growth cycle as part of the forest assets value. The fair value of forest assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy. Key estimates and judgements Fair valuation The valuation process of forest assets is complex and requires management estimates and judgement on assumptions that have a significant impact on the valuation of the group’s forest assets. Main factors used in the fair valuation of forest assets are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates. Stumpage price forecasts are based on the current prices adjusted by the management’s estimates for the full remaining productive lives of the trees, up to 150 years or until next regeneration cutting for forests in Finland and in the US and up to 10 years for plantations in Uruguay. The cash flows are adjusted by selling costs and costs related to future risks. Felling revenues and maintenance costs are estimated on the basis of actual costs and prices, taking into account the group’s projection of future price and costs development. In addition, calculations take into account future forest growth and environmental restrictions. The pre-tax discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Finnish forests in 2024 was 9.7% (9.5%) and for Uruguayan plantations 11.2% (11.5%). A decrease (increase) of one percentage point in discount rate would increase (decrease) the fair value of forest assets by approximately EUR 221 million (214 million). 4.3 Energy shareholdings UPM is both a significant purchaser and producer of energy. The majority of electrical and thermal energy is consumed at the group’s pulp and paper production. The production is mainly carried out by energy companies in which UPM has energy shareholdings. Energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments. Based on the shareholder agreements, UPM does not have control or joint control of or significant influence in the said energy companies. The value of energy shareholdings amounted to EUR 2,247 million (2,283 million) at the end of 2024. These energy companies supply electricity or both electricity and heat to their shareholders on a cost- price principle (Mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned. In 2020, UPM issued a shareholder loan of EUR 47 million without a maturity date to PVO. Embedded into the loan terms is a right to issue new shares in the PVO B2 series against the remaining, unpaid nominal of the loan starting from 2021. The loan is valued at fair value and is taken into account as a part of the total fair valuation of the PVO B2 series valuation.

The B and B2 series relate to PVO’s shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). UPM has no direct shareholdings in TVO. TVO operates three nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1, Olkiluoto 2 and Olkiluoto 3) in Finland. The operation of a nuclear power plant is governed by international, European Union and local nuclear regulatory regimes. Pursuant to the Finnish Nuclear Liability Act, the operator of a nuclear facility has a strict third-party liability in relation to nuclear accidents. Shareholders of power companies that own and operate nuclear power plants are not subject to the liability under the Nuclear Liability Act. In Finland, the future costs of conditioning, storage and final disposal of spent fuel, management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste as well as nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by a state established fund (the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund). The contributions to the Fund are intended to be sufficient to cover estimated future costs. These contributions have been taken into consideration in the fair value of the related energy shareholdings. Changes in energy shareholdings EURm 2024 2023 Carrying value, at 1 January 2,283 3,652 Disposals -4 — Changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income -32 -1,369 Carrying value, at 31 December 2,247 2,283 Accounting policies The group has made an irrevocable election to designate its energy shareholdings as equity instruments where changes in fair value are recognised through OCI. The shareholdings are not held for trading as the group has an intention to hold the investments for the long term. Purchases of energy shareholdings are initially and subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable, with only dividend income recognised through profit and loss. Initial fair value is acquisition cost including transaction costs. Upon disposal of the investment, the accumulated fair value changes in equity are not recycled to the income statement but instead, are reclassified from the fair value reserve to retained earnings. The fair value of energy shareholdings is a level 3 measure in the fair value measurement hierarchy. Key estimates and judgements Fair valuation and sensitivity Valuation of energy shareholdings requires management’s assumptions and estimates of a number of factors that may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset. Fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis and the main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends and discount rates. Changes in regulatory environment or taxation may also have an impact on the value of the energy generating assets. The valuation process is carried out by UPM Energy and the results are reviewed by management. The electricity price estimate is based on future electricity forward prices and a simulation of the Finnish area electricity price. A change of 5% in the electricity price used in the model would change the total value of the assets by EUR 250 (180) million. The discount rate of 8.07% (8.01%) used in the valuation model is determined using the weighted average cost of capital method. A change of 0.5% percentage points in the discount rate would change the estimated fair value of the assets by approximately EUR 180 (100) million. One of the main factors in the decrease in fair value during reporting period was the decrease in electricity forward market prices. Additionally, market price volatility’s impact on the value of hydropower assets has been updated, increasing the fair value of hydropower assets.

Impairment testing Impairment tests for goodwill and water rights with indefinite life were carried out in the fourth quarter 2024. Water rights of hydropower plants belonging to UPM Energy and reported in intangible rights amounted EUR 189 million at the end of 2024 and 2023. The values of water rights were tested based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydro power plant. The impairment test of water rights did not result in a recognition of any impairment in 2024 and 2023. Goodwill impairment tests were carried out for pulp operations in Finland and Uruguay, belonging to the UPM Fibres business area, UPM Raflatac business area, UPM Plywood business area and UPM Biochemicals business in Other operations. In 2024, the weakened pulp market and high wood costs have negatively affected the performance outlook of Pulp operations in Finland compared to previous estimates. As a result of the impairment test calculation, UPM impaired the entire goodwill of EUR 113 million. No other assets than goodwill was impaired. UPM Biochemicals CGU includes assets of Leuna biorefinery, which is the first of its kind new technology-based plant. The increased costs from the initial investment estimate and the construction delays indicated that the carrying amount of CGU may no longer be fully recoverable. As a result of the impairment test calculation conducted in December 2024, UPM impaired the entire goodwill of EUR 5 million and EUR 373 million of other assets. The remaining book value of the refinery closely aligns with the estimated cost of constructing a comparable plant in the current economic environment. Refer Note 4.1 Property, Plant and Equipment. The recoverable amount of CGUs was estimated based on value in use calculations. The basis for valuation and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing are summarised in the below table: CASH GENERATING UNIT BASIS OF VALUATION PERIOD OF FORECAST PRE-TAX DISCOUNT RATE KEY ASSUMPTIONS Pulp operations Finland Value in use 10 years + terminal value 10.55 % (2023: 10.68%) Pulp price, wood costs Pulp operations Uruguay Value in use 10 years + terminal value 9.12% (2023: 9.61%) Pulp price, wood costs UPM Raflatac Value in use 10 years + terminal value 10.59% (2023: 10.05%) Product prices, cost development UPM Plywood Value in use 10 years + terminal value 11.12% (2023: 12.06%) Product prices, cost development UPM Biochemicals Value in use 5 years + terminal value 9.69% (2023: 10.20%) Product prices, cost development Sensitivity analyses The sensitivity analyses of goodwill impairment tests indicate that no reasonable change in key assumptions would result in recognition of impairment loss against goodwill. In pulp operations Uruguay, the recoverable amount is most sensitive to pulp sales prices. Key estimates and judgements The group’s assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life assets requires significant judgement. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and operational conditions. Actual cash flows could therefore vary from estimated discounted future cash flows and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods. Future cash flows The review of recoverable amount for goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using management projections of future cash flows. The most important assessments and assumptions needed in calculations are forecasts for future growth rates for the business in question, product prices, cost development and the discount rates applied. The group is using mainly ten-year forecasts in calculations as the nature of the group’s business is long term, due to its capital intensity, and is exposed to cyclical changes. For UPM Biochemicals, the group used five-year forecasts in calculations due to different maturity level of the business. In estimates of product prices and cost development, forecasts prepared by management for the next three years and estimates made for the following two to seven years are taken into consideration. In addition, consideration is given to the investment decisions made by the group as well as the profitability programmes that the group has implemented and the views of knowledgeable industry experts on the long-term development of demand and prices. In the projection of cash flows UPM uses EBITDA adjusted with cash flows not captured within EBITDA, including working capital movements and capital expenditures. An assumed terminal value is based on a EBITDA multiples six times, except for UPM Biochemicals for which perpetuity value is determined using inflation based 2% growth rate. Discount rate The discount rate is estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the calculation date adjusted for risks specific to the business in question. The adjusted after-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each cash generating unit (CGU) based on the specific tax rate applicable to where the CGU operates. Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arises in connection with business combinations where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment and is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies from the business combination. Intangible rights Intangible rights include water rights of hydropower plants, patents, licences, intellectual property and similar rights. Water rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as the company has a contractual right to exploit water resources in the energy production of power plants.

"The values of water rights are tested annually for impairment based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydropower plant. Other intangible rights are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years. Software and other intangible assets Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred in acquiring software that will contribute to future period financial benefit are capitalised to software and systems. Other intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years. Impairment testing Goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes the group identifies its cash-generating units (CGUs), which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a business area. The carrying amount for the CGU includes goodwill, non-current assets and working capital. If the balance sheet carrying amount of the CGU unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount of the asset is less than the carrying amount. The carrying amount of the asset is then reduced to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset’s net selling price and its value in use. 4.5 Provisions EURm RESTRUCTURING TERMINATION ENVIRON- MENTAL EMISSIONS OTHER TOTAL 2024 Provisions at 1 January 59 117 27 56 6 266 Provisions made during the year 27 58 — 78 26 189 Provisions utilised during the year -29 -90 -1 -68 -1 -189 Unused provisions reversed -4 -5 -1 -1 -3 -14 Reclassifications 1 -1 — — — — Translation differences — — — — — 1 Provisions at 31 December 55 79 26 66 28 253 Non-current 89 Current 165 Total 253 2023 Provisions at 1 January 14 22 29 53 15 134 Provisions made during the year 53 129 2 69 5 258 Provisions utilised during the year -6 -30 -3 -65 -12 -116 Unused provisions reversed -1 -4 -2 — -2 -10 Reclassifications -1 — 1 -1 — -1 Provisions at 31 December 59 117 27 56 6 266 Non-current 170 Current 96 Total 266 UPM has undergone several restructuring programmes in recent years including mill closures and profit improvement programmes. Restructuring provisions recognised include various restructuring activities including dismantling costs. Termination provisions include severance payments, unemployment compensations or other arrangements for employees leaving the company. In Finland, termination provisions include also unemployment arrangements and disability pensions. Unemployment provisions in Finland are recognised 2–3 years before the granting and settlement of the compensation. At 31 December 2024 and 2023, restructuring and termination provisions relate mainly to capacity closures and optimisation of operations in UPM Communication Papers business area. In 2024, additions to restructuring and termination provisions of EUR 71 million relate to closures of Hürth newsprint mill and Nordland fine paper machine 3 and the planned closure of Raflatac Kaltenkirchen factory. In 2023, additions to restructuring and termination provisions of EUR 143 million relate to the closure of UPM Plattling paper mill and paper machine 6 at UPM Schongau paper mill. The group recognises provisions for normal environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred in a future period upon a removal of non-current assets and restoring industrial landfills where a legal or constructive obligation exists. Other provisions mainly include other short-term obligations related to emission rights. Provisions for emissions include liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights. The group possesses emission rights amounting to EUR 264 million (256 million) as intangible assets. » Refer Note 2.3 Operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights. Accounting policies A provision is recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current). Restructuring and termination provisions A restructuring provisions is recognised when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when the plan has been communicated to those who are affected. Employee termination provisions are recognised when the group has communicated the plan to the employees. Environmental provisions Environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed. The recognition of environmental provisions is based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations. Such provisions are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located. The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised and subsequently depreciated as part of the asset. Provisions do not include any third-party recoveries. Emission provisions Emission obligations are recognised in provisions based on realised emissions. The provision is measured at the carrying amounts of the corresponding emission rights held, which are recognised as intangible assets. In case of deficit in emission rights, the shortage is valued at the market value at the balance sheet date. Key estimates and judgements Environmental provisions The estimates used in determining the provisions are based on the expenses incurred for similar activities in the current reporting period taking into account the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account of any such changes. The discount rate applied is reviewed annually. The group aims to operate in compliance with regulations related to the treatment of waste water, air emissions and landfill sites. However, expected events during production processes and waste treatment could cause material losses and additional costs in the group’s operations. Legal contingencies Management judgement is required in measurement and recognition of provisions related to pending litigation. Provisions are recorded when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event, an unfavourable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Due to inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the actual losses may differ significantly from the originally estimated provision. » Refer Note 9.2 Litigation for details of legal contingencies. 4.6 Working capital The group defines operating working capital as inventories, trade receivables, trade payables and advances received which are presented separately below.
