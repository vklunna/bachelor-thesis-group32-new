"185 BMW Group Report 2024 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor’s Report Remuneration Report Other Information Sustainability Statement Structured approach to minimizing risks when processing customer data Protecting vehicle data The BMW Group is responsible for protecting any vehicle data transmitted. This includes the secure transmission and pro- cessing of such data by BMW Group contractors. BMW Group automobiles use internet connections or private networks to con- nect to the ConnectedDrive backend or third-party services. A special gateway controls access to the internet in accordance with the extended vehicle approach, which is based on the ISO 20078 standard. This approach ensures compliance with data protection and data security requirements at a high level, while also fulfilling legal cybersecurity requirements, such as the UN R155 regulation. As part of the CarData service offering, customers purchasing BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce automobiles are provided with full transparency and control over how their data is shared with third parties. CarData meets the requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) with regard to the right to ac- cess information and data portability, while also providing a basis for meeting the requirements of the Data Act in 2025. The roll- out of this service in Europe in 2017 and in the USA in 2020 is testament to the BMW Group’s commitment to complying with country-specific data protection regulations. The California Con- sumer Privacy Act (CCPA) that applies in the USA is another ex- ample of this. Health and safety Product quality and product safety standards All BMW Group products and services are required to meet the highest standards in terms of quality and safety, People’s safety has top priority, right from the vehicle development stage. The Corporate Strategy unit bears overall strategic responsibility for product quality. Responsibility for the vehicle safety strategy lies with the development for the entire vehicle. The relevant depart- ments are responsible for implementing the measures. Data transparency is created by collecting metadata for every IT application on a central platform. Monetary risk values are calculated automatically. The responsibilities for the respective applications are defined within the CDD network. The implementation of the measures is continuously measured and re- ported internally. Measures such as increasing IT security, decommissioning systems or adapting interfaces are carried out.

"186 BMW Group Report 2024 To Our Stakeholders Combined Management Report Group Financial Statements Responsibility Statement and Auditor’s Report Remuneration Report Other Information Sustainability Statement Optimum chassis tuning, highly effective braking systems and stable passenger compartments are of key importance in this re- gard. In addition, the vehicles are equipped with the latest safety systems for active and passive driving safety, which both reduce the risk of accidents occurring – for example, through collision warning or lane departure warning systems – and mitigate the consequences of an accident, for example via airbags or seat belts. To this end, the responsible Company departments con- tinuously monitor the latest research findings on health and safety and take them into account in the requirements for vehicle development. Safety concepts for BMW Group vehicles To protect occupants and other road users, the new vehicle mod- els meet stringent internal safety standards and comply with statutory requirements. The latest findings from in-house re- search into accidents and product monitoring, involvement in na- tional and international research projects, and analyses of exter- nal accident databases are fed into the development process. The growing demands of international consumer protection or- ganisations, such as the New Car Assessment Programmes (NCAP) worldwide, constitute an important element and are also taken into account. With this in mind, our security concepts are designed to be broadly applicable and consider, among other things, factors such as height, build and gender. In addition, all BMW Group automobiles worldwide have been equipped with an automatic emergency braking system since the roll-out of the most recent generation of on-board electrical systems. In particular, child protection requires specific criteria to be ap- plied in vehicle design. This is how the Company ensures that its vehicles are compatible with all commonly available types of child car seats. In addition, the safety of children is considered both in terms of vehicle occupants and as road users. To this end, crash tests are conducted for different age groups. Our automatic emergency braking system is designed with children in mind, es- pecially in challenging driving situations. The implementation of these safety criteria is monitored as part of the internal target and reporting system. In the reporting year, the BMW Group again scored highly in in- dependent tests conducted by consumer organisations. Follow- ing top ratings in Europe, the USA and Korea, the BMW 5 Series has now also been awarded by the Chinese C-NCAP and C-IASI programmes1. The new MINI Countryman and the BMW X2 were both awarded five stars by Euro NCAP and named “Top Safety Pick” by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) in the USA. The BMW X5 achieved a Top SafetyPick+. Percentage of vehicle models2 rated by NCAP programmes with an overall five star safety rating3 in % 2024 European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) 85.0 China New Car Assessment Programme (C-NCAP) 100.0 U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Programme (NCAP) 33.0 Korean New Car Assessment Programme (KNCAP) 100.0 In 2024, the Company performed safety- and compliance-re- lated technical operations that affected approximately 12.2 mil- lion vehicles3. All of these operations were voluntary and carried out in close coordination with the authorities. The BMW Group works accord- ing to the principle of prevention. To avoid technical operations of this type going forward, the BMW Group has also developed a comprehensive programme that has been in place since 2023. The Company works continuously to further improve the safety of its vehicles. Safeguarding quality standards The problem management process is another component of the quality strategy. It comprises all the elements required to identify, process and resolve technical problems in a sustainable manner, all the way from development and production to use by the cus- tomer. The logging of complaints regarding safety-related defects fulfils a legal requirement. This involves the use of defined sensors that collect and evaluate data relevant to products in series produc- tion. The problem management process ensures that irregulari- ties are identified reliably, forwarded for processing and that the solution is followed up. The BMW Group has set itself the goal to address 100% of these complaints within one year. This indicator has been published since the 2022 financial year and is compiled on an annual basis. The reference period is 1 December of the previous year to 30 November of the report- ing year. The target has not changed since the indicator was es- tablished, and the target has been met every year. In the report- ing year 2024, 100% of the safety and compliance-related problems were passed on to the responsible departments for resolution. In addition, the problem management process is continually monitored using other internal metrics, with any weak points be- ing identified and optimised. Raising awareness of safe driving The BMW Group is committed to road safety and, in this context, offers a range of driver training courses. The options range from the standard BMW Safety Training course to the compact half- day Safety Compact programme and a tailored course for people with disabilities. Each of these offerings aims to improve driving skills, boost self-confidence behind the wheel and, as a result, increase the safety of all road users. 1 China Insurance Automotive Safety Index. 2 Vehicle models that were listed in the BMW Group portfolio at the end of the 2024 reporting year. 3 Additional disclosure, based on SASB ↗ SASB Index."

In addition, compliance with statu- tory prohibitions and limits on the use of chemical substances is monitored. Substitutes are sought for hazardous substances that are categorised as being of very high concern in accordance with Articles 57 and 59 of the REACH Regulation, provided they are used with a proportion exceeding 0.1% by mass in a mixture in the production processes, while taking factors such as eco- nomic and technical requirements into account. If such sub- stances cannot be avoided, they are used under controlled con- ditions and in strict compliance with hazardous substance regu- lations. To the extent possible, the BMW Group excludes the use of prob- lematic substances right from the vehicle design stage and sets out corresponding stipulations for its suppliers. Guidance is pro- vided in the form of the ↗ Global Automotive Declarable Substance List (GADSL). Furthermore, the Company is committed to reducing exposure to emissions inside the vehicle to a minimum. All BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce brand Automobiles are equipped as standard with interior air filters for pollutants and particles. Since 2020, the BMW Group has been using interior air filters equipped with nan- ofibre technology that not only trap fine dust, but also certain mi- crobial particles and allergens. Given that vulnerable people react particularly sensitively, the statutory requirements for potentially hazardous substances in- clude children in particular. Therefore, complying with threshold values also regularly comprises the protection of children’s health."

Positive Impact − BMW Group Compliance Manage- ment System (CMS) » Compliance Management System (CMS) − Rate of completion of the manda- tory “Compliance Essentials” web- based training course − Internal compliance regulations − Internal communications activities and case-by-case consultation by Compliance − Regular monitoring, including re- porting to management Upstream material Own Operations material Downstream material Preventing, detecting and combating corruption and bribery The BMW Group’s corporate culture is based on values and fun- damental beliefs, founded on trust, mutual respect and tolerance. The Code of Conduct transposes the BMW Group’s corporate values into essential guiding principles for all employees. This boosts employees’ sense of individual responsibility. In this con- text, they are also supported by a Compliance organisation and a regulatory framework to ensure that the Company acts within the law at all organisational levels. The CMS comprises measures to combat corruption and bribery, thereby reinforcing a culture of integrity and compliance. In particular, it helps to re- duce sanction and liability risks, as well as risks arising from other (non-)financial disadvantages such as reputational risks. Clear assignment of roles and responsibilities is also essential. The CMS applies to all affiliated companies in which the BMW Group holds a majority interest of more than 50%, in par- ticular fully consolidated affiliated companies of the BMW Group, whereby BBA maintains its own CMS with the same level of ef- fectiveness as the Group’s CMS. Non-controlling interests and 50:50 joint ventures are not part of the BMW Group’s compli- ance organisation and are not covered by the CMS. These com- panies are required to set up and implement their own adequate and effective compliance programmes, by taking a risk-based approach, and to report on these to the BMW Group. This also applies to joint operation Spotlight Automotive Ltd. In exercising the rights as a shareholder of non-controlling interests with stra- tegic relevance, BMW AG seeks to ensure effective compliance (ongoing development of a risk-adequate CMS and its proper im- plementation). As a shareholder, BMW AG receives reports on CMS-related topics and information as required. Further infor- mation on the CMS can be found in the Compliance section. » Compliance Management System (CMS), » Compliance as a corporate function The central Group Compliance function sets out the basic struc- ture of the CMS, including the anti-corruption compliance pro- gramme. The key components of the programme include a spe- cific and Company-wide risk analysis, instructions containing specific guidance on how to act in situations where there is a risk of corruption, training courses, communications and case-by- case consultations. In addition, employees are provided with support in day-to-day situations via IT systems. Regular moni- toring is also carried out to ensure compliance with requirements. The BMW Group has set up a notification system to handle que- ries and notifications on compliance-related issues, including corruption and bribery. For more information on the notification system, please refer to the Compliance section. » Compliance and notification systems As part of the Detect function of central Group Compliance, com- pliance investigations are conducted on an ad hoc or non-ad hoc basis and where necessary, action measures are derived. Any infringements are immediately remedied, with an emphasis on reducing the risk of repeat offences as far as possible. Where in- fringements can be traced to an individual, that person will be appropriately sanctioned, in accordance with the processes de- fined for this purpose. This applies to all areas covered by the CMS, including combating corruption. For information on the monitoring and control mechanisms of the CMS, see the Compli- ance section. » CMS monitoring and controls Avoiding conflicts of interest in compliance investigations Compliance investigations are generally performed by the local Compliance functions in consultation with central Group Compli- ance, provided the issues are not of a Company-wide nature and there are no indications of conflicts of interest on the part of the local function. Compliance investigations with a company-wide impact are performed by Group Compliance. Should any suspi- cion arise in connection with the central Group Compliance func- tion, Group Corporate Audit assumes responsibility for investi- gating the matter. This means that the committee conducting the investigation is kept separate from the line management in- volved."
