"Annual report 2024 - CFE 46 • several new project finance arrangements in both Belgium, Luxembourg and Poland were put in place on similar terms to those prevailing before the health crisis. As at 31 December 2024, BPI Belgium and its subsidiary BPI Luxembourg together had € 60 million in confirmed bilateral credit lines, of which € 3 million had been drawn down by BPI Luxembourg. Risks related to special-purpose vehicles To carry out some of their real estate projects, BPI Belgium, BPI Luxembourg and/or BPI Poland belong to special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”) which provide real guarantees in support of their credit facilities. The risk, in the event of the failure of this type of company and exercise of the guarantees, is that the proceeds from such exercise are not sufficient to cover some or all of the amount of shareholders’ equity or equivalent used as collateral for setting up the credit facility. The Business Units concerned therefore take measures and steps to mitigate risk, such as: • sharing risk with partners; • financing through non-recourse or limited-recourse debt against shareholders; • paying special attention to the preparation phase and stakeholder relations, and • monitoring marketing and sales momentum. Risks related to the ability to sell projects The activity, financial position, results and prospects of Business Units’ operating in Real Estate Development are almost entirely de­ pendent on the sale of its projects. Investments in real estate projects for which no planning permission has been obtained yet are relatively illiquid. The Business Units concerned may be unable to find a suitable buyer for this type of asset if it needs cash. Moreover, market conditions may force them sell their projects at lower prices than planned. The segment’s inability to generate positive cash flow from project sales can adversely affect its capacity to repay its debts. To mitigate this risk, the following measures and factors come into play: • carrying out careful market research before any investment and during development; • inserting suspensive conditions in land purchase contracts. • limiting unsecured transactions, with a minimum pre-commercialisation threshold required; • elasticity of demand in the residential market, and • adopting a conservative and prudent financing strategy, characterised by diversification of financing sources and a broad group of banking partners. Risks related to portfolio concentration The vast majority of projects in this segment are residential. Consequently, any slowdown or regulatory changes or any market changes affecting the residential market may have a considerable negative impact on the segment’s results and operations. In the financial year 2023, BPI Luxembourg was particularly affected by a slowdown in the sector and the market has recovered only slightly in 2024. The Group therefore takes the following risk management measures: • diversifying the portfolio and projects, in Belgium, Poland and Luxembourg, and • maximising anticipation of any legislative change likely to impact projects by providing for an adjustment of the contractual provisions (price, deadline) in the event of legislative, fiscal or regulatory change. Risks related to stakeholders The Real Estate Development segment maintains contractual relations with several parties, such as partners, investors, tenants, en­ trepreneurs, financial institutions and architects. Those stakeholders may experience disruptions in their operations or be confronted with financial difficulties that may cause a delay or total inability to meet their contractual obligations. The Business Units of the Real Estate Development segment are therefore ensuring that the following measures are implemented: • strengthening controls for awarding and monitoring works; • including guarantees in contractual agreements, with a preference for first demand bank guarantees; • prior screening and ongoing monitoring of stakeholder creditworthiness, and • arranging appropriate insurance policies.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 47 Risks specific to the Investments & Holding segment DEEP C HOLDING (PORT CONCESSIONS IN VIETNAM) Geopolitical risk The political situation in Vietnam has been stable for many years. However, even if highly unlikely, political risk can never be com­ pletely ruled out. Therefore, other than monitoring the evolution of the country’s political situation, no other specific measures to manage this risk are currently in place. Liquidity and financing risks Project development requires significant investment. Deep C Holding may be exposed to liquidity risk, in particular: • obligations to repay existing debt, and • general needs. Deep C Holding has therefore put in place corporate financing with its subsidiary Infra Asia Investment HK, as well as local financing in Vietnam to finance both fixed assets such as warehouses or leased infrastructure, and the working capital requirements of the various industrial zones etc. Green Offshore (minority stakes in Belgian offshore wind farms, Rentel and SeaMade) Given that (i) the two wind farms are built, financed and fully operational and (ii) a minimum price for the electricity produced is guaranteed by a green certificate mechanism, the significant residual risks are: • maintenance budget overruns, and • the production of green electricity, which depends on weather conditions and the availability of wind turbines. 1.3. Major events after the close of the financial year No significant change in the Group’s financial and commercial situation has occurred since 31 December 2024. 1.4. Research and development In 2024, the Group pursued a number of innovative projects. One of these projects involves kitting, which the BPC Group Business Unit has successfully trialled on its Erasme I and Tervuren sites. This intelligent logistics tool is aimed in particular at delivering goods to a consolidation centre, re-palletising ad hoc and LEAN-compliant phased delivery directly to the work area concerned. The Group’s digital transition also accelerated in 2024 by stepping up its efforts to develop tools based on artificial intelligence. These advances are part of the Group’s drive to modernise its approach to the building industry and offer its customers safer, sus­ tainable, high-performance solutions. For example, the Group has been working on a project based on artificial intelligence, called “AI-Generated Income Forecasting for Construction Sites”. The initial aim of this project was to use historical cash flow data from the sites of the Construction & Renova­ tion segment to create scripts applying polynomial regression at different degrees in order to optimise cash flow forecasts. Artificial intelligence would be used to adapt these scripts dynamically, taking account of project sectors (residential, logistics, industrial, etc.), building heights and foundation methods. Moreover, the teams explored potential applications in 2024, considering that future professional development could benefit from the integration of ERP systems, with data being a key factor. Finally, CFE Poland continues to use and update its parametric design model that generates a 3D model, a carbon footprint assess­ ment and a budget estimate for logistics or industrial projects in just a few clicks. This tool helps to understand the impact of differ­ ent parameters on project budgets and carbon footprints, enabling the Group to propose more optimal buildings to its customers. 1.5. Financial instruments The Group has defined a system of investment limits to manage the counterparty risk. This system determines maximum amounts eligible for investment by counterparty defined according to their credit rating published by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. These limits are regularly monitored and updated. 1.6. Outlook 2025 The medium- and long-term outlook for CFE is positive, thanks to its positioning in the growth markets of renovation and energy performance improvement of existing buildings, the development of infrastructure linked to the energy transition and sustainable mobility as well as industrial automation.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 97 change on the community, such as extreme weather events or rising sea levels. Consequently, although these projects are essential for urban and social development, their direct contribution to climate change adaptation remains limited. As CFE does not actually hold any real estate in its portfolio, there is no real financial risk associated with climate change adaptation. The absence of these assets means that CFE is not directly exposed to the potential costs associated with upgrading or protecting infrastructure against climate impacts. ESRS E1 SBM-3 19c Although climate change mitigation is a material issue for CFE, involving the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as its en­ ergy consumption, the theme of energy transition is not considered a material subject. This is because Scope 3 emissions, including embodied and operational carbon, are significantly higher than direct emissions. In other words, indirect emissions linked to the materials used and building operations account for a much larger share of CFE’s total carbon footprint, so the leverage effect of this energy transition is much less relevant than managing Scope 3 emissions. For this reason, CFE will not report on ESRS E1-5. The assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities linked to climate change has been carried out taking into account the Group’s different business lines, as each segment may present specific IROs. A consolidation exercise was then carried out as described in chapter 1.5 of the DMA. This analysis was carried out taking into account different time horizons (current, short-term, medium-term and long-term). On the other hand, the anticipated financial effects of IROs have been omitted by applying the phase-in principle. ESRS E1 SBM-3 19 a, b , ESRS E1 SBM-3 AR7b Although climate change is material for CFE, it does not constitute a risk requiring immediate and radical adaptation of the group’s business model. Indeed, the current model is already in line with the strategy, which focuses on designing and developing sustaina­ ble buildings, intelligent industry and infrastructure for green energy and mobility. Rather, it’s a transition to increased activity of this kind in the future, and both the teams and the company are ready for it. ESRS E1 SBM-3 19 c, ESRS E1 SBM-3 AR 8b 2.2.2. E1.IRO-1: Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities CFE has assessed the list of ESRS themes in its DMA, including ESRS E1 climate change, ESRS E2 pollution, ESRS E3 water and marine re­ sources, ESRS E4 biodiversity and ecosystems, and ESRS E5 resource use and circular economy. On the basis of the DMA carried out, only ESRS E1 climate change is identified as a risk with a high materiality of impact and financial impact. The process of identifying impacts, risks and opportunities is described in more detail in section 1.4.3 relating to DMA in Sustainability Statements. As stipulated in the ESRS, the DMA exercise covers the entire value chain and is assessed over different time horizons. ESRS E1.IRO-1 20 a,b,c, AR 9 et AR12a The main risks, opportunities and impacts are transition risks. These are detailed in chapter 1.5.2. For climate risks, the phasing-in of provisions for the year ending 31 December 2024 have been used. CFE has developed a method­ ology for assessing climate risks and opportunities. This assessment will cover both physical and transitional risks in its own opera­ tions, as well as along the upstream and downstream value chain (including detailed scenario suggestions and time horizons to be covered in short-, medium- and long-term scenario analysis). Phase in requirements for ESRS ­E1.IRO-1, ­AR 11 a, b, c & d, 21, AR 12 a, b, c & d, 21 et AR 15 An initial analysis indicates that no major physical risks have been identified in connection with the Group’s activities. This analysis confirms the DMA results. The assessment will therefore focus on transition risks. The results of this assessment could have an impact on the DMA exercise carried out. 2.2.3. E1-2 Climate change mitigation policies CFE has drafted a policy entitled “Climate Change Policy”. It does not cover climate change adaptation, as this theme has not been deemed material. ESRS E1-2 24, 25 This policy applies to all the Group’s activities and is addressed to all Group employees. It was drafted by the Group’s CSO and ap­ proved by the Executive Committee and Board of Directors. It is available to employees via the Group intranet. With this policy, CFE undertakes not only to monitor its GHG emissions, but also to implement the actions necessary to achieve its ambitions in terms of reducing these emissions. Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements Message from the Chairman and CEO"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 98 To ensure the quality and completeness of the data monitored, this policy is accompanied by a specific manual on data definition and collection methods. Data is collected by the Business Units and consolidated by the central teams in accordance with GHG protocol methods. This policy also addresses the roles and responsibilities of the various Business Units in drawing up local action plans. It is also based on standards and certifications specific to the various businesses (ISO, CO2 performance scale, etc.). CFE revised its decarbonisation objectives in 2024 and now aims to reduce its direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 40% by 2030 com­ pared with 2020 emissions. Indirect emissions (scope 3) need to be reduced by 20% by 2030, compared with the values measured in 2024. ESRS E1-2 24 The path to decarbonisation is a complex one, as the construction sector has a long, fragmented and interdependent value chain. Rather than setting bold ambitions without concrete actions, CFE believes in annual progress based on operational excellence, available technologies and innovation efforts. The growth in turnover and CAPEX in line with the EU’s taxonomy is further proof of this commitment. There is clearly still a need to improve data collection, establish comparable baselines for the sector as a whole, and verify the fea­ sibility and availability of technologies that can act as levers for decarbonisation. As a result, the 2050 transition plan is still under development. This takes into account the evolution of current technological limitations, insufficient sector innovation, and the overall lack of visibility on the commitments of the rest of the sector. Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions were only calculated this year, and still have their limitations, as already highlighted above. On the other hand, a GHG reduction plan for 2030 has been put in place, demonstrating our decarbonisation efforts. This plan is based on the SBTi framework. Although not yet formally validated, CFE will adhere to the SBTi framework as soon as possible. ESRS E1-1 16a 2.2.4. E1-1, E1-3 et E1-4: Transition plans, decarbonisation levers, targets and resources in relation to cli­ mate change policies To remain in touch with the field and market while guaranteeing a global and integrated strategic approach despite its decentral­ ised business model, CFE has put in place clear ESG governance. The overall strategy, long-term vision and target setting is the responsibility of CFE’s Executive Committee. In particular, this means that the Group’s overall GHG emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 and the related transition plans (in line with the CSRD) are the responsibility of the Executive Committee. On the other hand, each Business Unit develops its own specific reduction action plans, taking into account its own business and oper­ ating model. The relevance of these plans and the possibility of carrying out collective actions are assessed at Sustainability Boards. As climate change and the negative impact of GHG emissions have been identified as material issues at Group level, these aspects are included in the annual ESG review at Board level. Changes in indicators and targets are also presented annually to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. ESRS E1-1, 16 h & i In 2024, 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are supported by a GHG reduction plan for 2030. For 2050, no commitment has been made for the reasons explained in section 2.2.3. Consequently, no Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are currently covered by a transition plan for this horizon. This plan is currently under development. 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have reduction targets set for 2030 (short-term). These targets are aligned with SBTi and therefore compatible with the Paris agreements to limit global warming to 1.5°C in terms of reduction ambition, although they have not yet been formally validated by SBTi. ESRS E1-4, 34 e & 16 a For Scope 3 GHG emissions, the most significant emission categories were mapped in 2024. Emissions representing less than 1% of the total are considered non-material and will not be reported. A consultant carried out an audit to verify that no material aspect of the scope 3 emissions calculation had been overlooked, and that the calculation methodology was indeed correct. The data collected in 2024 is considered a reference value for setting the basis for reduction efforts in 2030. Scope 3 emissions come mainly from the emissions category purchases of goods and services, and are based on expenditure data for the materials with the high­ est emissions for the business sector (concrete, steel, special techniques, façade elements). This calculation method will be subject to subsequent adjustments to improve accuracy. Where relevant to the company, more granular data will be collected based on activity data, to refine calculations and provide better information on actions to be taken. This will be an ongoing process for years to come. Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements Message from the Chairman and CEO"

Information on workers and their contracts comes from the social secretariats. This data is consolidated in a single HR management dashboard. In Belgium, the various Group entities have a single social secretariat for all 2,282 employees, which guarantees the reliability and robustness of the data. In Luxembourg and Poland, there is also a social secretariat for each country. Non-employees, on the other hand, are not taken into account. It’s not material.

These plans focus on both non-technical and technical skills, to facilitate the maintenance of skilled employment. At the end of 2022, CFE launched its “CFE academy”. It is an online training platform that allows each employee to find customised training courses, both in terms of content and format. The digital approach (while keeping the option of attending face-to-face training) allows for greater flexibility for employees to train when it suits them best. Specific health and safety training sessions are organised, for example, when employees are hired, when they arrive on site, at monthly toolbox meetings and during dedicated “safety days”. The number of training hours within CFE and its BUs is monitored through the CFE Academy program. This data is measured as a total and by gender. However, it is not listed by worker category.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 113 3.1.11. S1-14 Health and safety metrics Since safety is a major concern, CFE has developed QHSE dashboards to keep close track of the trend in the figures and to take the necessary remedial action as soon as possible. The severity rate (one of the traditional security indicators) was chosen to be one of the KPI’s governing our sustainability linked loans with the banks. The dashboards, which contain the main information for each subsidiary, are updated at least once a month to keep track of the safety data. They include traditional safety information (frequency and severity rates etc.) but also indicators of proactive safety actions (toolbox meetings, management involvement, taking into account incidents and feedback, etc.). This data covers 100% of the Group’s own workers. This does not include self-employed workers, temporary staff or subcontractors. The monitoring of this data follows the rules prescribed by ISO 9001 and the Belgian legal definitions for safety indicators: • Frequency rate = number of lost-time accidents x 1 million divided by the number of working hours. • Severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of working hours. • A lost-time accident is an accident in the workplace resulting in at least one day’s incapacity, not including the day of the acci­ dent. • An accident without incapacity is an accident that does not result in incapacity for work beyond the day of the accident. • A first aid accident is an accident requiring only first aid on the spot. These are not included in this report. • Recordable incidents are the sum of lost-time accidents and accidents without incapacity (excluding first-aid). • The frequency rate is calculated as follows: number of lost-time accidents x 1,000,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • The severity rate is calculated as follows: Severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • The recordable incident rate is calculated as follows: number of recordable incidents x 1,000,000 divided by number of hours worked.

In Poland, on the other hand, accidents and their consequences are recorded in national records. This information is therefore robust, complete and reliable. ESRS S1-14 88 The safety of subcontractors is also taken into account in a specific dashboard (see chapter 3.2.7). 3.1.11.1 Incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts No offences or complaints of discrimination or failure to respect human rights were recorded in 2024. No fines have been reapplied either. ESRS S1-17 3.2. ESRS S2: Workers in the value chain This analysis focuses specifically on subcontractors rather than the entire value chain of a construction project. The main reason is that the value chain in this sector is often very long and fragmented, involving many different players with varying roles. Further­ more, there is not always direct contact with the lower links in this chain, which makes it difficult to assess all the potential risks and impacts in a comprehensive and accurate way. By focusing on subcontractors, who are key partners and directly involved in site operations, it is possible to implement more targeted and effective safety measures, ensuring better management of material risks and a significant improvement in working conditions.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 83 closely monitored. A regular review of this matrix was then carried out and systematically validated by the administrative, management and control bodies. This methodology anticipated to some extent the philosophy of a DMA under the CSRD. In 2024, CFE took a new DMA approach using the concept of “financial materiality” (outside-in) and “impact materiality” (inside-out) based on ESRS 2 and EFRAG IG1’s implementation guidance “Materiality assessment”. The methodology for identifying potentially material themes has been presented in chapter 1.4- SBM-2 Interest and view of stakeholders. The methodology used to determine the IROs relating to these themes and to assess them will be presented in chapter 1.6 IRO-1 and 2 Double materiality assessment. CFE is convinced that the results presented give a true and fair view of its key sustainability issues, including impacts, risks and op­ portunities. The following sections provide more details on the results of the DMA and the process applied. 1.5.1. Results of the double materiality assessment exercise The table below summarises our assessment of the importance of sustainability issues, indicating whether they have an impact or financial materiality (or both). As far as the financial perspective is concerned, it specifies whether the importance is linked to a risk or an opportunity. Only material sub-themes are represented. The analysis of the IROs was carried out in detail with the various stakeholders. On the basis of the DMA, three topics were selected as material: “Climate change mitigation”, “Safety and health of own workforce” and “Safety and health of subcontractors”. CFE presents its analysis of IROs in chapter 1.5.2 “Impact, risks and opportunities for material themes”. The other chapters of the Sus­ tainability Statement detail policies, objectives, key performance indicators and progress for each material theme in accordance with the CSRD format, following the sequence included in the ESRS under “2. environmental information”, and “3. social information“.

Value chain workers (ESRS S2) - Working conditions - Health and safety The first material theme is therefore the mitigation of the effects of climate change. Indeed, the construction sector has a significant impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. From a financial point of view, there is a significant risk of increasing costs linked to possible taxes or the need to use materials or techniques that could prove more costly. On the other hand, the move towards new markets such as energy renovation and the construction of buildings in line with the European taxonomy represent real opportuni­ ties for the sector. The risks and opportunities envisaged, however, do not require an immediate and radical adaptation of the Group’s business mod­ el. Indeed, the current model is already in line with the strategy, which focuses on designing and developing sustainable buildings, intelligent industry and infrastructure for green energy and mobility. Rather, it’s a transition to increased activity of this kind in the future, and both the teams and the company are ready for it. Further details can be found in section 2.2.1. The health and safety of the Group’s workers and subcontractors working on the sites are the two other key issues. In particular, there is a high probability of negative impact, as the sector is known to be highly accident-prone. Strictly speaking, there is no ma­ terial financial risk or opportunity for these themes. There is therefore no need to plan any radical changes to the business model, but rather to continue with the specific actions put in place to reduce the risk of accidents on site as much as possible for everyone involved in the project. Further details can be found in section 3.1.2 and 3.2.2. The double materiality exercise also shows that two topics are fairly close to the materiality thresholds defined by CFE (see details of the definition of these thresholds in chapter 1.6.2). These topics concern “talent management and retention” and “management and use of incoming resources”. These themes in particular are therefore closely monitored internally, as they could become material in Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements Message from the Chairman and CEO yes no no"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 84 a future reassessment of the internal and external context. Preventive actions are therefore taken. As far as talent is concerned, the emphasis is on training and communication. CFE has also developed a CFE Academy, digitising training courses and facilitating access to them at the most convenient times for employees. The monitoring of employee apprais­ als and development has also been digitised. In terms of resources, particular attention is paid to key project resources, as well as to developments in the circular economy mar­ ket and the use of biobased materials. These subjects are monitored on a regular basis. The double materiality exercise also shows that the themes of corporate culture, whistleblower protection and corruption and brib­ ery (combined in a “business conduct and compliance with the law” theme) are not material, which might seem surprising at first glance. A critical analysis and verification of assumptions and materiality thresholds has therefore been carried out specifically for these themes. This analysis confirmed the results obtained. Indeed, although benchmarking shows that in similar companies, the theme of governance is often highlighted, there is not yet sufficient public data on materiality analyses in the context of CSRD at the time of the DMA 2024 exercise. This could lead to a biased comparison. It is also important to underline the differences in activity, geographical presence and structure that distinguish CFE from its peers that could be taken as a reference for comparison. The probability of a governance-related incident is relatively low when assessing the financial impact. Several observations can be made in this regard: • Geographic: CFE has limited its commercial activities to Belgium, Poland, Luxembourg and Germany. In this European so­ cio-economic context, solid regulations, well-enforced laws and a politically stable environment significantly reduce the likeli­ hood of corruption-related incidents. • As a listed company, the CFE group has a strong information culture. It adheres to high standards of financial reporting and transparency, reinforcing its internal control processes. • Finally, the track record of the group confirms this sound management. Further information can also be found in chapter 4 Information on governance. The same question could be asked of climate change adaptation. This is mainly due to the nature of CFE’s activities. In terms of opportunities, CFE does not specialise in civil engineering or in the creation of specific engineering structures to protect against the effects of climate change, such as dykes, storm water basins, etc. With regard to projects traditionally carried out by CFE (hous­ ing, offices, etc.), current regulations already take considerable account of the main risks in our regions.Nor does CFE have many buildings or real estate in its portfolio that could be at risk. Furthermore, based on the DMA, the following themes (from the short­ list of potentially material topics as listed in sections 1.4.4 and 1.4.5) were also not considered material: energy, biodiversity, waste management, water use, resource use related to products and services, DE&I, economic, social, and cultural rights of communities (land-related impacts), and supplier relationship management. 1.5.2.

In 2024, CFE reviewed its objectives by committing to reduce its absolute GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 compared with 2020’s values. This target is com­ patible with the Paris Agreements and is in line with the SBTi (but has not been officially validated by the SBTi). ESRS E1-4 33 Scope 1 and 2 emissions mainly concern production activities, i.e. Construction & Renovation and Multitechnics. It is therefore in these activities that actions aimed at limiting GHG emissions are mainly deployed. On the other hand, efforts relating to the fleet (company cars) concern all the Group’s activities. ESRS E1-4 34b Lever 1 - Mobility and logistics The first lever activated concerns mobility. As far as company cars are concerned, a mobility plan that benefits workers has been rolled out across the Group to encourage the adoption of alternative modes of transport such as cycling or public transport. Electric cars are widely encouraged. To facilitate adoption, charging stations are installed at most of the Group’s worksites. The fill rate of the vans as well as their routes are being optimised, and tests are being carried out with hybrid and electric vans. Finally, trucks and other heavy construction equipment are gradually being replaced by less polluting vehicles. Mobility-related actions alone repre­ sent a potential 28% reduction in total GHG scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. Lever 2 - Site energy consumption A second tool for limiting GHG production is to reduce energy consumption for site installations. On site, we monitor energy con­ sumption and can now optimise consumption by tracking down abnormal over-consumption in particular. Understanding of this consumption is supported by improvements in the insulation of the building site containers, as well as various corrective measures. Solar panels are also installed on many construction sites. The positioning of the site installations therefore also takes into account the optimisation of sunlight for the site cabins. In general, the use of green electricity is recommended on construction sites when­ ever possible. The reduction potential of these actions is of the order of 15% by 2030. Particular attention is paid to generators used for site start-up or as occasional back-up for winter heating needs. These generators consume large amounts of energy. Pilot studies are being carried out with batteries or hydrogen generators. The reduction potential has not yet been assessed, as current technologies are not yet efficient. Lever 3 - Office energy consumption For existing head offices where CFE owns the premises, energy audits have been carried out as well as renovations to keep energy consumption to a minimum. Solar panels and energy management systems have also been installed. Finally, BPC, BPI Real Estate, CLE, Van Laere, VMA and CFE’s head office have moved into new buildings designed and built by the group’s entities, all of which are very low-energy buildings. CFE’s new Wood Hub headquarters is particularly exemplary in terms of energy consumption. The building is heated and cooled by geothermal energy and heat pumps, and is equipped with 300 solar panels. This makes Wood Hub almost energy independent, with primary energy consumption of no more than 8.59 kWh per m2.

This means that they are not limited to car­ bon dioxide (CO2) alone, but also include other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). ESRS E1-6 AR 39b For the CFE group, the limits of GHG reporting under financial (accounting) and operational control are the same. This is due to the fact that all Business Units are fully integrated into the consolidated financial statements. Projects under joint control (joint ventures or joint operations) are accounted for according to CFE’s share (pro-rata) in the project. This integrated approach ensures that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting is consistent with financial reporting.

Emis­ sions come mainly from the fleet (cars, vans and trucks) and energy (gas and fuel oil) used on construction sites and at the Group’s various headquarters. The fleet alone accounts for 74% of these emissions. The emission factors used to calculate Scope 1 direct emissions are taken from the database www.CO2emissiefactoren.be.

They include indirect GHG emissions mainly arising from the production of electricity purchased and consumed by CFE and its subsidiaries. Scope 2 emissions based on location are calculated by multiplying purchased electricity volumes by the emission factors specific to each country. To calculate Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions using the market-based approach, CFE relies on green electricity contracts as the contractual instruments for the electricity purchased. In total, CFE’s commitment is reflected in the fact that 73% of the kWh purchased and con­ sumed uses green electricity.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 113 3.1.11. S1-14 Health and safety metrics Since safety is a major concern, CFE has developed QHSE dashboards to keep close track of the trend in the figures and to take the necessary remedial action as soon as possible. The severity rate (one of the traditional security indicators) was chosen to be one of the KPI’s governing our sustainability linked loans with the banks. The dashboards, which contain the main information for each subsidiary, are updated at least once a month to keep track of the safety data. They include traditional safety information (frequency and severity rates etc.) but also indicators of proactive safety actions (toolbox meetings, management involvement, taking into account incidents and feedback, etc.). This data covers 100% of the Group’s own workers. This does not include self-employed workers, temporary staff or subcontractors. The monitoring of this data follows the rules prescribed by ISO 9001 and the Belgian legal definitions for safety indicators: • Frequency rate = number of lost-time accidents x 1 million divided by the number of working hours. • Severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of working hours. • A lost-time accident is an accident in the workplace resulting in at least one day’s incapacity, not including the day of the acci­ dent. • An accident without incapacity is an accident that does not result in incapacity for work beyond the day of the accident. • A first aid accident is an accident requiring only first aid on the spot. These are not included in this report. • Recordable incidents are the sum of lost-time accidents and accidents without incapacity (excluding first-aid). • The frequency rate is calculated as follows: number of lost-time accidents x 1,000,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • The severity rate is calculated as follows: Severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • The recordable incident rate is calculated as follows: number of recordable incidents x 1,000,000 divided by number of hours worked.

In Poland, on the other hand, accidents and their consequences are recorded in national records. This information is therefore robust, complete and reliable. ESRS S1-14 88 The safety of subcontractors is also taken into account in a specific dashboard (see chapter 3.2.7). 3.1.11.1 Incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts No offences or complaints of discrimination or failure to respect human rights were recorded in 2024. No fines have been reapplied either. ESRS S1-17 3.2. ESRS S2: Workers in the value chain This analysis focuses specifically on subcontractors rather than the entire value chain of a construction project. The main reason is that the value chain in this sector is often very long and fragmented, involving many different players with varying roles. Further­ more, there is not always direct contact with the lower links in this chain, which makes it difficult to assess all the potential risks and impacts in a comprehensive and accurate way. By focusing on subcontractors, who are key partners and directly involved in site operations, it is possible to implement more targeted and effective safety measures, ensuring better management of material risks and a significant improvement in working conditions.

ESRS G1-1_10a, ESRS G1-1_10c, ESRS G1-3_18a No violations were recorded at 2024. No fines have been imposed either. Nevertheless, the Belgian judicial authorities are currently conducting an investigation into alleged criminal acts relating to the con­ struction of the Grand Hotel in N’Djamena, Chad. As a reminder, this contract, which dates back to 2011, resulted in a loss of more than EUR 50 million for CFE, due to the non-payment of part of its receivables. The work was carried out by CFE Tchad, a Group sub­ sidiary until its sale in 2021. As part of this investigation, a search was carried out at CFE’s head office on 4 September 2024. In addition, several members of management and the Board of Directors, as well as former employees of the CFE group, were interviewed. However, at the date of this report, CFE has not yet had access to the investigation file and no charges have been brought against CFE or its current man­ agers and/or directors, nor, to its knowledge, against former employees of the CFE group. CFE is cooperating fully with the current investigation.

This means that an economic activity must not only make a substantial contribu­ tion to one or more environmental objectives, but must also not cause significant harm to any of these objectives. • eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score): This is an indicator used to measure the likelihood of your employees recommending your organisation as a place to work. To calculate the eNPS, employees are asked the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company as a good place to work?” The responses are then classified into three catego­ ries: • Detractors (scores from 0 to 6): employees who are not very satisfied and would not recommend the company. • Passive (scores of 7 to 8): employees who are satisfied but not enthusiastic, and who would not actively recommend the company. • Promoters (scores of 9 to 10): very satisfied employees who would actively recommend the company. The eNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters, giving a score between -100 and 100. • EPB (Energy Performance of Buildings): This refers to the efficiency with which buildings use energy. • EPD (Environmental Product Declaration): Standardised document providing detailed information on the environmental im­ pact of a product throughout its life cycle. • ESG ( Environment, Social and Governance): This is a set of criteria used to assess a company’s sustainability and ethical impact • ESG (Policy): Statement setting out the company’s approach to environmental, social and governance issues, as well as the plan for achieving this, and the indicators used to measure progress. • ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards): Companies subject to the CSRD will have to report in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Standards are adapted to EU policies, while drawing on and contribut­ ing to international standardisation initiatives. • EU Taxonomy: regulations that determine which investments can be classified as ‘green’ and which contribute to the realisa­ tion of the EU Green Deal. The classification is based on technical screening criteria (TSC) and minimum criteria to avoid signif­ icant harm (DNSH). • Frequency rate: The frequency rate measures the number of accidents at work resulting in at least one day’s absence from work per million hours worked. It is used to assess the degree to which employees are exposed to occupational risks. • GHG - scope 1: all direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company (e.g. fleet, fuel and natural gas combus­ tion). • GHG - scope 2: all indirect emissions from the production of electricity purchased by the company. Scope 2 emissions occur physically at the facility where the electricity is generated. • GHG - scope 2 location based: This method calculates emissions using the average emission factor of the electricity network where the energy is consumed. It reflects the average emissions intensity of local electricity networks • GHG- scope 2 market based: This method calculates emissions based on the electricity that organisations have chosen to purchase, often specified in contracts or instruments such as renewable energy certificates (RECs). It takes into account the company’s specific energy supply choices. • GHG – scope 3: indirect emissions from a company’s activities, such as emissions from the production of sourced products (upstream) or from products, services or projects sold by the company (downstream). • GHG protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol): A standardised global framework for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. It provides the most widely used standards for GHG emissions accounting, helping companies, countries and cities to track their progress towards climate goals. • Human Rights: Rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. • ILO (International Labour Organization) : This is a specialised agency of the United Nations. Its mandate is to promote social and economic justice by establishing international labour standards • IRO (Impact, Risks and Opportunities); • Impacts: The effects that the company’s activities have on the environment and society. • Risks: The potential threats facing the company, such as climate or financial risks. • Opportunities: Potential opportunities for development and innovation • JV (Joint Venture): This is a commercial partnership in which two or more companies join forces to carry out a joint project.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 98 To ensure the quality and completeness of the data monitored, this policy is accompanied by a specific manual on data definition and collection methods. Data is collected by the Business Units and consolidated by the central teams in accordance with GHG protocol methods. This policy also addresses the roles and responsibilities of the various Business Units in drawing up local action plans. It is also based on standards and certifications specific to the various businesses (ISO, CO2 performance scale, etc.). CFE revised its decarbonisation objectives in 2024 and now aims to reduce its direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 40% by 2030 com­ pared with 2020 emissions. Indirect emissions (scope 3) need to be reduced by 20% by 2030, compared with the values measured in 2024. ESRS E1-2 24 The path to decarbonisation is a complex one, as the construction sector has a long, fragmented and interdependent value chain. Rather than setting bold ambitions without concrete actions, CFE believes in annual progress based on operational excellence, available technologies and innovation efforts. The growth in turnover and CAPEX in line with the EU’s taxonomy is further proof of this commitment. There is clearly still a need to improve data collection, establish comparable baselines for the sector as a whole, and verify the fea­ sibility and availability of technologies that can act as levers for decarbonisation. As a result, the 2050 transition plan is still under development. This takes into account the evolution of current technological limitations, insufficient sector innovation, and the overall lack of visibility on the commitments of the rest of the sector. Furthermore, Scope 3 emissions were only calculated this year, and still have their limitations, as already highlighted above. On the other hand, a GHG reduction plan for 2030 has been put in place, demonstrating our decarbonisation efforts. This plan is based on the SBTi framework. Although not yet formally validated, CFE will adhere to the SBTi framework as soon as possible. ESRS E1-1 16a 2.2.4. E1-1, E1-3 et E1-4: Transition plans, decarbonisation levers, targets and resources in relation to cli­ mate change policies To remain in touch with the field and market while guaranteeing a global and integrated strategic approach despite its decentral­ ised business model, CFE has put in place clear ESG governance. The overall strategy, long-term vision and target setting is the responsibility of CFE’s Executive Committee. In particular, this means that the Group’s overall GHG emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 and the related transition plans (in line with the CSRD) are the responsibility of the Executive Committee. On the other hand, each Business Unit develops its own specific reduction action plans, taking into account its own business and oper­ ating model. The relevance of these plans and the possibility of carrying out collective actions are assessed at Sustainability Boards. As climate change and the negative impact of GHG emissions have been identified as material issues at Group level, these aspects are included in the annual ESG review at Board level. Changes in indicators and targets are also presented annually to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. ESRS E1-1, 16 h & i In 2024, 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are supported by a GHG reduction plan for 2030. For 2050, no commitment has been made for the reasons explained in section 2.2.3. Consequently, no Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions are currently covered by a transition plan for this horizon. This plan is currently under development. 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have reduction targets set for 2030 (short-term). These targets are aligned with SBTi and therefore compatible with the Paris agreements to limit global warming to 1.5°C in terms of reduction ambition, although they have not yet been formally validated by SBTi. ESRS E1-4, 34 e & 16 a For Scope 3 GHG emissions, the most significant emission categories were mapped in 2024. Emissions representing less than 1% of the total are considered non-material and will not be reported. A consultant carried out an audit to verify that no material aspect of the scope 3 emissions calculation had been overlooked, and that the calculation methodology was indeed correct. The data collected in 2024 is considered a reference value for setting the basis for reduction efforts in 2030. Scope 3 emissions come mainly from the emissions category purchases of goods and services, and are based on expenditure data for the materials with the high­ est emissions for the business sector (concrete, steel, special techniques, façade elements). This calculation method will be subject to subsequent adjustments to improve accuracy. Where relevant to the company, more granular data will be collected based on activity data, to refine calculations and provide better information on actions to be taken. This will be an ongoing process for years to come. Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements Message from the Chairman and CEO"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 99 Scope 3 GHG emissions have reduction targets set for 2030. Although these targets are compatible with the reduction ambitions of the Paris agreements, they are not formally validated by the SBTi. These targets will be determined according to the emission inten­ sity of the various materials.

In 2024, CFE reviewed its objectives by committing to reduce its absolute GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 compared with 2020’s values. This target is com­ patible with the Paris Agreements and is in line with the SBTi (but has not been officially validated by the SBTi). ESRS E1-4 33 Scope 1 and 2 emissions mainly concern production activities, i.e. Construction & Renovation and Multitechnics. It is therefore in these activities that actions aimed at limiting GHG emissions are mainly deployed. On the other hand, efforts relating to the fleet (company cars) concern all the Group’s activities. ESRS E1-4 34b Lever 1 - Mobility and logistics The first lever activated concerns mobility. As far as company cars are concerned, a mobility plan that benefits workers has been rolled out across the Group to encourage the adoption of alternative modes of transport such as cycling or public transport. Electric cars are widely encouraged. To facilitate adoption, charging stations are installed at most of the Group’s worksites. The fill rate of the vans as well as their routes are being optimised, and tests are being carried out with hybrid and electric vans. Finally, trucks and other heavy construction equipment are gradually being replaced by less polluting vehicles. Mobility-related actions alone repre­ sent a potential 28% reduction in total GHG scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. Lever 2 - Site energy consumption A second tool for limiting GHG production is to reduce energy consumption for site installations. On site, we monitor energy con­ sumption and can now optimise consumption by tracking down abnormal over-consumption in particular. Understanding of this consumption is supported by improvements in the insulation of the building site containers, as well as various corrective measures. Solar panels are also installed on many construction sites. The positioning of the site installations therefore also takes into account the optimisation of sunlight for the site cabins. In general, the use of green electricity is recommended on construction sites when­ ever possible. The reduction potential of these actions is of the order of 15% by 2030. Particular attention is paid to generators used for site start-up or as occasional back-up for winter heating needs. These generators consume large amounts of energy. Pilot studies are being carried out with batteries or hydrogen generators. The reduction potential has not yet been assessed, as current technologies are not yet efficient. Lever 3 - Office energy consumption For existing head offices where CFE owns the premises, energy audits have been carried out as well as renovations to keep energy consumption to a minimum. Solar panels and energy management systems have also been installed. Finally, BPC, BPI Real Estate, CLE, Van Laere, VMA and CFE’s head office have moved into new buildings designed and built by the group’s entities, all of which are very low-energy buildings. CFE’s new Wood Hub headquarters is particularly exemplary in terms of energy consumption. The building is heated and cooled by geothermal energy and heat pumps, and is equipped with 300 solar panels. This makes Wood Hub almost energy independent, with primary energy consumption of no more than 8.59 kWh per m2.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 113 3.1.11. S1-14 Health and safety metrics Since safety is a major concern, CFE has developed QHSE dashboards to keep close track of the trend in the figures and to take the necessary remedial action as soon as possible. The severity rate (one of the traditional security indicators) was chosen to be one of the KPI’s governing our sustainability linked loans with the banks. The dashboards, which contain the main information for each subsidiary, are updated at least once a month to keep track of the safety data. They include traditional safety information (frequency and severity rates etc.) but also indicators of proactive safety actions (toolbox meetings, management involvement, taking into account incidents and feedback, etc.). This data covers 100% of the Group’s own workers. This does not include self-employed workers, temporary staff or subcontractors. The monitoring of this data follows the rules prescribed by ISO 9001 and the Belgian legal definitions for safety indicators: • Frequency rate = number of lost-time accidents x 1 million divided by the number of working hours. • Severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of working hours. • A lost-time accident is an accident in the workplace resulting in at least one day’s incapacity, not including the day of the acci­ dent. • An accident without incapacity is an accident that does not result in incapacity for work beyond the day of the accident. • A first aid accident is an accident requiring only first aid on the spot. These are not included in this report. • Recordable incidents are the sum of lost-time accidents and accidents without incapacity (excluding first-aid). • The frequency rate is calculated as follows: number of lost-time accidents x 1,000,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • The severity rate is calculated as follows: Severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • The recordable incident rate is calculated as follows: number of recordable incidents x 1,000,000 divided by number of hours worked.

In Poland, on the other hand, accidents and their consequences are recorded in national records. This information is therefore robust, complete and reliable. ESRS S1-14 88 The safety of subcontractors is also taken into account in a specific dashboard (see chapter 3.2.7). 3.1.11.1 Incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts No offences or complaints of discrimination or failure to respect human rights were recorded in 2024. No fines have been reapplied either. ESRS S1-17 3.2. ESRS S2: Workers in the value chain This analysis focuses specifically on subcontractors rather than the entire value chain of a construction project. The main reason is that the value chain in this sector is often very long and fragmented, involving many different players with varying roles. Further­ more, there is not always direct contact with the lower links in this chain, which makes it difficult to assess all the potential risks and impacts in a comprehensive and accurate way. By focusing on subcontractors, who are key partners and directly involved in site operations, it is possible to implement more targeted and effective safety measures, ensuring better management of material risks and a significant improvement in working conditions.

Acquisitions In 2024, BPI Real Estate Luxembourg acquired two additional plots of land on the Pourpelt site in Bertange. BPI currently owns around 30% of the surface area of this future new residential district. In Poland, boosted by the commercial success of phase 1 of the Panoramiqa project in Poznan, BPI Real Estate has secured phases 2 and 3 in the fourth quarter of 2024. These two new phases have the potential for more than 600 additional apartments in four sepa­ rate buildings. Construction should start in 2026 once planning permission has been obtained. Projects in the study phase BELGIUM In Brussels, the permits for the Move’Hub project (54,000 m2, including 38,000 m2 of office space) were received at the end of the year. An appeal has been lodged by the Saint-Gilles commune against the planning permission and by IEB (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles) against the environmental permit. Permits for the Key West (63,300 m2) and Uni’Vert (10,000 m2) projects are also being challenged before the Conseil d’Etat. In Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, the permit for the Samaya project received a negative advice by the local council. A modified, less dense permit will be introduced in March 2025 that takes into take account the remarks made. In Arlon, BPI Real Estate has obtained the combined permit (permis unique) for its Clarisse project, comprising 60 residential units (6,350 m2). Building permits have been obtained. In Liège, on the Bavière site, planning permission has been granted for the new school building of the Haute Ecole Provinciale du Barbou. The deed of sale with the Province should be signed in April 2025. Message from the Chairman and CEO Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 34 LUXEMBOURG BPI Real Estate has appointed the team of architects, ASSAR SHL and Moreno-A2M, for its Kronos project on the Kirchberg plateau. Permits applications will be submitted in the first half of 2025, and dismantling works are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter. In Belval, BPI and its partner are actively preparing for the launch of THE ROOTS project. Preparatory earthworks have been complet­ ed and construction is due to start shortly. This is a mixed-use project comprising 6,000 m2 of office space, 102 apartments and a food market. POLAND Permit applications for the next development phases of the Cavallia site in Poznan are currently being prepared. In Gdansk, an initial permit application for 141 housing units is currently being processed. Start of construction and marketing of new projects BELGIUM Construction of the Brouck’R project, located in the centre of Brussels, began at the end of the year, at the same time as the sale to La Loterie Nationale of its future headquarters. This building - exemplary in terms of sustainability - with an above-ground surface area of 6,800 m2, is under construction. The commercialisation of the first phase of housing units is currently being prepared for launch in the spring of this year. Furthermore, BPI and its partner have launched the major renovation of the EQ building in the European district (approx. 19,000 m2). Advanced discussions are ongoing with prospective tenants or buyers. POLAND In Warsaw, BPI has launched construction of its residential project PianoForte (10,000 m2, 101 housing units). Sales are off to a satis­ factory start. Delivery of the building is scheduled for late 2026. Residential projects under construction or delivered in 2024 BELGIUM In the first half of the year, BPI delivered the PURE project (Auderghem) and the first phase of the Bavière project (19,000 m2). The first is fully sold, while the second has a sales rate of over 80%. In the fourth quarter, the Arboreto project in Tervuren (7,000 m2) and the “Parc” building on the Erasmus Gardens site in Anderlecht (9,000 m2) were delivered, while the last apartments in the Tervuren Square project in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre (12,000 m2) were deliv­ ered in January 2025. The sales rate for these three projects is around 65%. This percentage is rising steadily. In Antwerp, construction of the John Martin’s residential project (10,000 m2) is progressing satisfactorily. As a reminder, this building was pre-sold en bloc to ION Residential Platform NV. Delivery is scheduled for summer 2025. LUXEMBOURG In Mertert, BPI Real Estate has delivered the third phase of the Domaine des Vignes project, while construction of the two blocks of the fourth and final phase (7,000 m2) is well underway. 75% of the apartments in this last phase have been sold, including a block sale of 20 apartments to the Luxembourg government which will be completed in 2025. POLAND Three residential projects were delivered during the second half of 2024, namely Bernardovo in Gdynia (13,000m2), the first phase of Panoramiqa in Poznan (20,000 m2) and Czysta in Wroclaw (10,000 m2). These three projects, totalling 567 residential units, have a near 80% sale rate. Four projects are also currently under construction : Chmielna Duo in Warsaw (17,000 m2) and the first three phases of the Cavallia project (25,000 m2) in Poznan. These projects will be delivered in 2025. New partnership in Poland In December 2024, a year after securing a major property in Gdansk, BPI Real Estate sold 50% of this development to a new player on the Polish market, owned and financed by Belgian investors. This transaction not only frees up BPI Real Estate’s financial resources for new projects, but also lays the foundations for a new long-term partnership. This transaction will have a positive impact on earn­ ings in 2025.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 41 • failure of partners (co-contractors, suppliers, subcontractors) or clients; • organisational, technical, contractual, administrative and regulatory difficulties in performing the contractual objective, which may affect the Group’s deadlines, costs, cash flow, quality and reputation, and • dispute of the invoice and the final account by the customer. The measures for managing the aforementioned risks are: • “upstream” : • prior analysis; • negotiation with the client to aim for a balanced sharing of risks; • consideration by the Engagement Committee prior to submitting tenders for projects exceeding a certain threshold; • assessment of the appropriate size of teams involved, and • incorporation of feedback in the design phase. • “downstream” : • organising project site preparation; • setting up specific and appropriate management systems; • applying price revision formulae or upstream consideration of the impact of variations in costs not covered by the formu­ lae; • transferring risk to subcontractors and suppliers; • prior selection of technical solutions and equipment; • dialogue with the customer and project owner; • drafting contractual clauses stipulating reciprocal commitments; • providing payment guarantees, • arranging insurance policies. Risks related to inflation Inflation remains relatively high in both Belgium and Poland, but has largely receded from its peak in 2022-2023. Inflation risk is mitigated by: • inserting a price revision clauses in contracts, and • concluding lump-sum contracts with certain subcontractors and/or suppliers. Economic risks The Group’s four segments are by nature subject to strong cyclical fluctuations. Nevertheless, this observation must be qualified for each segment, since the key factors can vary between them. Thus, the construction and real-estate development activities related to the office property market move in line with the traditional economic cycle, while the residential business depends more directly on general economic conditions, consumer confidence and interest rates. The measures taken by the Group to manage these risks are: • diversification of the Group’s activities; • monitoring of upstream orders through the “selective bidding” procedure, and • monitoring changes in the order book and project performance. Legal risks Segment activities are based on contracts that are subject to a complex regulatory environment as concerns the places where services are performed and the fields of activity involved. Disputes may arise during the performance of contracts, resulting in par­ ticular from assessment differences of new elements during performance, a change in the customer’s governance, new case law, even or a misinterpretation of contractual clauses. Information on the main disputes and arbitrations in which the Group is involved is provided in note 29 (Disputes) of the consoli­ dated financial statements. These disputes are reviewed at the year-end date and, if necessary, provisions are made to cover the estimated risks. Risk management measures mainly involve the inclusion of contractual clauses to : • passing on to the customer any additional costs and/or time resulting from changes made at the customer’s request after the contract has been signed • stopping the work in case of non-payment; • excluding consequential damages; • excluding or limiting liability for existing pollution; Message from the Chairman and CEO Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 101 the carbon content of its buildings. BPI Real Estate uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in accordance with EN19578 and relies on the taxonomy’s criteria wherever possible. As Multitechnics contractors and companies, CFE actively proposes sustainable and innovative alternatives at the tender stage or even during project execution. These may be reused material alternatives, bio-sourced materials, or others. A centralised centre of expertise supports field teams in developing these sustainable variants and solutions, and also centralises best practices in a database available to all Group employees. CFE is also involved in innovative pilot projects, such as the Buildwise project to optimise site logistics through the use of consolida­ tion centres with Buildwise. Lever 2 - Stimulating change in the sector CFE participates in, and/or chairs, numerous sector-specific working groups aimed at implementing large-scale sustainable and innovative solutions. In particular, this concerns the circular economy, the adoption of the “CO2 performance ladder”, the revision of public specifications, etc. CFE is also particularly active in the Belgian Alliance for Sustainable Construction (BA4SC), which brings together representatives of the various professional associations in the construction sector around the themes of sustainability and climate change in particular. Lever 3 - Opportunities in the business model CFE has also launched three new Business Units aimed at bringing a new, more sustainable approach to construction projects. They are Wood shapers, Vmanager and Pulse. Wood Shapers, a subsidiary of the CFE group, specialises in sustainable construction using mainly wood and other bio-sourced materials. With its focus on reducing carbon footprints and using recyclable materials, Wood Shapers contributes to greener con­ struction. Furthermore, the spaces created by the company are designed to enhance the well-being of occupants through healthy materials and safer working environments. VMA offers ESCO services that provide guaranteed energy performance to clients who so desire. In 2020, VMA launched Vmanager, a piece of software and an App targeting energy savings, energy flow management and, in general, construction technology man­ agement. This innovative tool facilitates intelligent and sustainable management of new and renovated buildings by combining VMA’s technical expertise, intensive monitoring and tools to supervise and control their actual energy performance. The develop­ ment of Vmanager combined with the know-how of VMA makes it possible to offer a global solution for energy management. Finally, Pulse specialises in property redevelopment, offering an integrated solution to improve energy efficiency, reduce carbon emissions and increase occupant comfort. The company offers services ranging from energy and environmental audits to com­ plete building renovation and the installation of innovative technologies. Pulse aims to increase the value of its clients’ real estate assets while meeting environmental requirements and guaranteeing an optimal return on investment.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 102 other actions concern raising awareness or switching to alternative means of transport, which are included in the Group’s mobility plan. This plan takes into account all aspects of mobility (TCO, taxes, etc.) and does not involve any particular costs or investments. Levers 2 and 3: Energy consumption on site and in the offices To limit this, on-site consumption is monitored daily to prevent energy wastage, solar panels are being installed on the site barracks and more efficient generators are being used. There are no major costs associated with these actions, as the reduction in con­ sumption generally offsets the investment in equipment. These amounts are marginal. At the same time, a switch to green energy has already been in place since 2020. The relocation of CFE and its subsidiaries BPC, BPI, CLE, VMA and Van Laere to new buildings that consume very little energy (notably Wood Hub), as well as the renovation of other group headquarters, has also significantly reduced the group’s energy consumption. CFE has not identified any assets whose economic lifetime should be reduced. Note on CAPEX aligned with European taxonomy Capex plays an essential role in the development of sustainable activities. These relate to equipment and machinery, CFE’s own fleet and, to a lesser extent, CFE’s offices and production sites. In 2024, a total of EUR 27 million was invested in these categories, 13.97% of which was directly linked to sustainable projects, in accordance with the EU taxonomy. Indirect emissions: Scope 3 At this stage, it is too early to draw conclusions on the resources supporting the transition plan for Scope 3 emissions. It’s a complex subject because it concerns the entire value chain. A more detailed analysis will be carried out in 2025. Nevertheless, the initial trends are as follows: The CFE group’s activities will be developed to reduce costs in terms of CO2 emissions, particularly in terms of the choice of materi­ als and transporting materials and waste in the Construction & Renovation and Multitechnics segments. It is also expected that the proportion of renovation and energy-efficiency renovation work will increase as the regulatory framework evolves. The financial impact of the choice of materials or the development of new approaches to transport is estimated at the project submission stage and then incorporated into the commercial offer submitted to the customer. This study is carried out on a pro­ ject-by-project basis, so margins are re-evaluated at the start of each new order. On the other hand, a residual risk is the cost of the inefficiencies inherent in learning new production techniques or new approaches to logistics. This is because it is not always possi­ ble to anticipate (both at contractual level and when preparing for project implementation) and quantify with sufficient accuracy. The real estate business systematically includes solutions for reducing the energy consumption of buildings during the develop­ ment of new projects. In addition, renovation projects for existing buildings are becoming increasingly common. Once the land has been acquired to develop a project, a feasibility study is carried out. The cost price of the project is estimated and incorporated into the commercial offer made to customers. Specific framework To ensure that these actions are implemented, CFE has strengthened its management team with local Sustainability Officers work­ ing in the various Business Units, as well as a team working at the holding company to consolidate information and support local teams. The cost of this specific framework is included in “operating costs” as presented in the Financial Report on page 128. Further details will be provided from 2025 onwards. ESRS E1-3 29 ci, ESRS E1-1 16c The resources linked to the transition plan will be reassessed in greater detail in 2025 to analyse the costs linked to the scope 3 re­ duction plan, once this has been finalised. Similarly, an analysis will be made to take account of the 2050 targets and the corresponding reduction plan once it has been final­ ised.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 115 3.2.5. S2-3 Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise concerns To remedy negative impacts on sites, it is essential to put in place a structured process and effective communication channels. This process begins with the identification and assessment of potential impacts. This includes carrying out risk analyses to identify potential hazards and assess their severity and probability. At the start of site activities, each subcontractor is required to share this specific risk analysis with the site management team, in order to analyse the resources to be implemented and responsibilities to­ gether. Once the impacts have been identified, preventive and/or corrective measures must be implemented. This can include modifying work procedures, improving safety equipment, or training workers to better manage identified risks. It is crucial to document these measures and ensure that they are clearly communicated to all team members. To enable workers in the value chain to voice their concerns, several communication channels need to be established: Onboarding new workers: This onboarding provides information and training for new workers on a project. In particular, the organi­ sational chart of site management and their contact details are provided to facilitate future exchanges. Regular meetings: Weekly safety meetings are organised on projects where workers can discuss safety issues and propose solu­ tions. Direct communication lines: Subcontractors are encouraged to communicate any concerns or comments directly with site teams as a matter of priority. Mobile applications: On most worksites, a mobile app enables workers to report incidents or concerns quickly and easily. Security representatives: The site’s QHSE manager, along with the entire site management team, makes regular visits to the site, enabling direct interaction with all those involved. It’s also important to create a safety culture where workers feel comfortable reporting problems without fear of reprisal. This is en­ couraged by visible, committed leadership that values and respects workers’ contributions to safety. Finally, it is essential to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place, by tracking safety indicators. ESRS S2-3 27, 28 3.2.6. S2-4 Taking action on material impacts on value chain workers, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to value chain workers, and effectiveness of those actions Each project is unique and requires a specific risk analysis. This exercise must be carried out both by the project management team and by subcontractors. This analysis must be carried out before work begins, to enable a dialogue with the project’s management teams and to validate the most suitable working methods for limiting risks together. Scheduling will also be defined in such a way as to keep co-activities between workers to a minimum. Weekly site meetings allow us to see whether or not we need to adapt or correct the chosen work methods. Everyone involved in a project is jointly responsible for their own safety and that of others. On the other hand, subcontracting agree­ ments specify in detail the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. Among other things, it defines who is responsible for the breakdown and maintenance of collective protection equipment. Each subcontractor is responsible for his or her own personal protective equipment. On the other hand, the site management team will ensure that each employee uses the equipment correctly. The site management team will ensure that a responsible, collaborative and respectful site culture is in place. This working atmos­ phere facilitates communication and a genuine safety culture. Regular checks are carried out on site by the BU’s QHSE manager and by management teams. These visits enable us to identify safety shortcomings and correct them as quickly as possible. These visits are always accompanied by a visit report to ensure that every remark has been addressed. Control also involves regular monitoring and communication of safety indicators. A specific monthly dashboard also includes the number of incidents and accidents involving subcontractors. The management team will also ensure that subcontracting teams receive the necessary training. In the event of failure to comply with the established rules, penalties are applied. In the event of serious misconduct, the person responsible will be asked to leave the site with immediate effect and will not be allowed to return. CFE also monitors the company’s track record in terms of safety compliance and safety culture, and takes this into account when selecting subcontractors. CFE is not aware of any serious human rights problems or incidents linked to the upstream or downstream value chain (other than the site accidents listed in the following chapter).

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 116 All these actions do not represent any particular cost. In fact, most of these actions are already taken for own workers and are therefore already accounted for in chapter 3.1.6. ESRS S2-4 3.2.7. S2-5 Targets related to managing material negative impacts, advancing positive impacts, and managing material risks and opportunities At this stage, no quantifiable annual target has been set. Nevertheless, the overall objective is the same as for own workforce, i.e. to aim for zero accidents. ESRS S2-5 41 To this end, the number of work-related, lost-time accidents is monitored for all subcontractors working on our projects. This infor­ mation forms part of the safety dashboard presented to the Executive Committee on a monthly basis. Table 29: Subcontractor accident data 2022 2023 2024 Number of work-related fatalities (subcontractor or third party) 1 1 0 Number of accident with incapacity of subcontractors 29 30 35 ESRS S2-5 40 This data should be treated with great caution, as they are supplied by the subcontractors themselves, and their quality or com­ pleteness cannot be guaranteed. It is not possible to measure the frequency or severity rate for subcontractors, as these calcu­ lations would require knowing the number of days of incapacity and the number of hours worked by each subcontractor, but this data is not communicated to the general contractor. Please note that this data is limited to Tier 1 (subcontractors). Given the extent and complexity of the value chain, it is currently not physically possible to extend data collection to the lower levels of the chain (suppliers, manufacturers, etc.). Nevertheless, CFE is continuing to develop more robust processes for collecting value chain infor­ mation. At this stage, subcontractors are not involved in defining the target. This is mainly due to the size and complexity of the value chain involved in CFE projects. The global ambition for continuous improvement in terms of safety is a concern for the entire value chain. CFE and its various BUs actively participate in the ADEB-VBA Safety Board, where examples of best practices are shared and sec­ tor-specific projects initiated. ESRS S2-5 42 4. GOVERNANCE INFORMATION 4.1. ESRS2 IRO-1: Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities The double materiality exercise shown in chapter 1.5.1. also shows that the topics of corporate culture, whistleblower protection and corruption and bribery (combined in a “business conduct and compliance with the law” theme) are not material, which might seem surprising at first glance. The same applies to the theme of partnership, which covers such topics as supplier relations and payment practices etc. Nevertheless, CFE is committed to respecting these rules of business conduct as well as all stakeholders. The Group’s SPARC strat­ egy calls on us to “Perform” by aiming for excellence in our processes and risk management (the “P”), and to place people and the community at the heart of all our activities (the “C”). Consequently, compliance with the highest standards of probity and business integrity, as well as respect for human rights, are an integral part of the Group’s strategy. 4.2. Policies on responsible business culture All these rules and measures are set out in the “Code of Conduct” and the “Business Integrity Policies” manual. Both documents are available to all employees on the Group intranet. The code of conduct is also available on the CFE group website (https://www.cfe.be/fr/documents-de-la-societe). CFE also ensures that its entire value chain respects these rules. The rules and measures are set out in the “Business integrity policies for commercial partners” manual. The obligation to comply with these rules and measures is an integral part of the contracts we sign with our various business partners. This obligation applies equally to responsible business culture, social and environmental issues.

All these documents have been validated by the various administrative, management and supervisory bodies. At Executive Com­ mittee level, responsibility for business culture issues is assumed by the Group’s General Secretary, who is a permanent guest. The expertise of the various members of the administrative and supervisory bodies can be found in the chapter on the “Corporate Gov­ ernance Statement”. The roles and responsibilities of each body are also set out in the Corporate Governance Charter, also availa­ ble on the CFE group website (https://www.cfe.be/fr/documents-de-la-societe). ESRS G1.GOV-1_5a, ESRS G1.GOV-1_5b In particular, the “Business Integrity Policies” manual includes the following policies: • Gifts and entertainment policy • Policy on political involvement • Antitrust policy • International sanctions policy • Conflict of interest policy • Policy against bribery and corruption The Code of Conduct, while not exhaustive, deals with a set of general principles and ethical guidelines that can be applied at dif­ ferent levels of the Group and within the various Business Units. These include (among others): • Protecting teams and partners • diversity, equal opportunity and non-discrimination • health and safety • respect and freedom from harassment • data privacy • Ethical business conduct (this refers to the rules set out in the specific “Business Integrity Policies” manual described above) • Financial integrity • Themes relating to the environment, sustainability and respect for human rights and communities These various policies respect the International Bill of Human Rights (United Nations), the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (International Labour Organization) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Respect for the human rights of every individual is essential to CFE and lies at the heart of our fundamental values. We respect and protect human rights and take care not to exploit anyone, wherever we work in the world. Everyone we do business with is held to the same standards. We will never tolerate slavery, child labour, forced or compulsory labour, or trafficking in human beings. We respect the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our human rights policy is aligned with our Code and is overseen by CFE’s legal and human resources departments. In particular, as part of its human rights policy (https://www.cfe.be/fr/documents-de-la-societe), CFE is committed to respecting the eight fundamental ILO conventions. Specific policies on safety and diversity have also been implemented and communicated to all employees. 4.3. Specific objectives and monitoring of these policies The “code of conduct” and the various “business integrity policies” were completely revised in 2024. These documents are available on the intranet. To ensure knowledge and understanding of the rules contained therein, an online training cycle, which is mandatory for all employees, was rolled out during the last quarter of 2024 concerning the “Code of Conduct”, “Business Integrity Policies” and “Human Rights Policy”. ESRS G1-1 9, ESRS G1-1 10g, ESRS G1-3 20, 21a, 21b, 21c Alongside this training cycle, specific training courses and communication campaigns on cybersecurity, safety and diversity are also organised annually. Each entity regularly undergoes an analysis of risks and procedures by the internal audit unit. Internal audit is an independent func­ tion, and its main task is to support management and help it improve the management of risks. Internal audit reports functionally to the Audit Committee of CFE by submitting the annual audit plan and presenting the main findings of the audits carried out and a follow-up of the action plans. If necessary, additional audit assignments may be carried out at the request of the Audit Committee or of the Executive Committee of CFE.

The gross development value of the projects under development (BPI Real Estate share) is estimated at € 1.6 billion, i.e. 363,000 m2 of which 58,000 m2 is under construction. Acquisitions In 2024, BPI Real Estate Luxembourg acquired two additional plots of land on the Pourpelt site in Bertange. BPI currently owns around 30% of the surface area of this future new residential district. In Poland, boosted by the commercial success of phase 1 of the Panoramiqa project in Poznan, BPI Real Estate has secured phases 2 and 3 in the fourth quarter of 2024. These two new phases have the potential for more than 600 additional apartments in four sepa­ rate buildings. Construction should start in 2026 once planning permission has been obtained. Projects in the study phase BELGIUM In Brussels, the permits for the Move’Hub project (54,000 m2, including 38,000 m2 of office space) were received at the end of the year. An appeal has been lodged by the Saint-Gilles commune against the planning permission and by IEB (Inter-Environnement Bruxelles) against the environmental permit. Permits for the Key West (63,300 m2) and Uni’Vert (10,000 m2) projects are also being challenged before the Conseil d’Etat. In Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve, the permit for the Samaya project received a negative advice by the local council. A modified, less dense permit will be introduced in March 2025 that takes into take account the remarks made. In Arlon, BPI Real Estate has obtained the combined permit (permis unique) for its Clarisse project, comprising 60 residential units (6,350 m2). Building permits have been obtained. In Liège, on the Bavière site, planning permission has been granted for the new school building of the Haute Ecole Provinciale du Barbou. The deed of sale with the Province should be signed in April 2025. Message from the Chairman and CEO Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 34 LUXEMBOURG BPI Real Estate has appointed the team of architects, ASSAR SHL and Moreno-A2M, for its Kronos project on the Kirchberg plateau. Permits applications will be submitted in the first half of 2025, and dismantling works are scheduled to start in the fourth quarter. In Belval, BPI and its partner are actively preparing for the launch of THE ROOTS project. Preparatory earthworks have been complet­ ed and construction is due to start shortly. This is a mixed-use project comprising 6,000 m2 of office space, 102 apartments and a food market. POLAND Permit applications for the next development phases of the Cavallia site in Poznan are currently being prepared. In Gdansk, an initial permit application for 141 housing units is currently being processed. Start of construction and marketing of new projects BELGIUM Construction of the Brouck’R project, located in the centre of Brussels, began at the end of the year, at the same time as the sale to La Loterie Nationale of its future headquarters. This building - exemplary in terms of sustainability - with an above-ground surface area of 6,800 m2, is under construction. The commercialisation of the first phase of housing units is currently being prepared for launch in the spring of this year. Furthermore, BPI and its partner have launched the major renovation of the EQ building in the European district (approx. 19,000 m2). Advanced discussions are ongoing with prospective tenants or buyers. POLAND In Warsaw, BPI has launched construction of its residential project PianoForte (10,000 m2, 101 housing units). Sales are off to a satis­ factory start. Delivery of the building is scheduled for late 2026. Residential projects under construction or delivered in 2024 BELGIUM In the first half of the year, BPI delivered the PURE project (Auderghem) and the first phase of the Bavière project (19,000 m2). The first is fully sold, while the second has a sales rate of over 80%. In the fourth quarter, the Arboreto project in Tervuren (7,000 m2) and the “Parc” building on the Erasmus Gardens site in Anderlecht (9,000 m2) were delivered, while the last apartments in the Tervuren Square project in Woluwe-Saint-Pierre (12,000 m2) were deliv­ ered in January 2025. The sales rate for these three projects is around 65%. This percentage is rising steadily. In Antwerp, construction of the John Martin’s residential project (10,000 m2) is progressing satisfactorily. As a reminder, this building was pre-sold en bloc to ION Residential Platform NV. Delivery is scheduled for summer 2025. LUXEMBOURG In Mertert, BPI Real Estate has delivered the third phase of the Domaine des Vignes project, while construction of the two blocks of the fourth and final phase (7,000 m2) is well underway. 75% of the apartments in this last phase have been sold, including a block sale of 20 apartments to the Luxembourg government which will be completed in 2025. POLAND Three residential projects were delivered during the second half of 2024, namely Bernardovo in Gdynia (13,000m2), the first phase of Panoramiqa in Poznan (20,000 m2) and Czysta in Wroclaw (10,000 m2). These three projects, totalling 567 residential units, have a near 80% sale rate. Four projects are also currently under construction : Chmielna Duo in Warsaw (17,000 m2) and the first three phases of the Cavallia project (25,000 m2) in Poznan. These projects will be delivered in 2025. New partnership in Poland In December 2024, a year after securing a major property in Gdansk, BPI Real Estate sold 50% of this development to a new player on the Polish market, owned and financed by Belgian investors. This transaction not only frees up BPI Real Estate’s financial resources for new projects, but also lays the foundations for a new long-term partnership. This transaction will have a positive impact on earn­ ings in 2025. EQUITY AND NET FINANCIAL DEBT Shareholders’ equity stood at € 160.3 million on 31 December 2024, stable compared with 31 December 2023.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 40 Pollution, particularly from the use of construction materials and site activities, has an impact on air and soil quality. There is a risk of potential contamination of natural environments, as well as a more general risk of impact on biodiversity. The increasing scarcity of materials, aggravated by growing demand and disruptions to supply chains, poses challenges for the sustainability of resources. Waste management is therefore crucial, as construction sites generate large quantities of waste that must be sorted and recycled to minimise their impact on the environment. Finally, water usage is also an important issue, as construction activities consume large quantities of water, and wastewater discharges can pollute water resources. In this regard, the Group is committed to reducing pollution and environmental waste by aiming for “ZERO environmental incidents”. To this end, all Group teams are committed to exemplary behaviour and to rigorously following Quality, Health, Safety and Environ­ ment policies (“QHSE”), which are based on the requirements detailed in ISO 9001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 , as well as VCA certifica­ tion. In particular, the Group’s Business Units may be subject to various risks linked to the environmental conditions of the projects in which they are involved. In addition to the economic aspects, environmental risks can also be assessed in terms of image and reputation, as the operation may be affected over the long term by their consequences. From a longer term perspective, changes in regulations related to the ecological transition may also constitute a risk factor. All these risks can therefore generate human, technical, financial and legal issues. The measures for managing the risks are: • analysing these risks as early as the tender phase and developing solutions with the development teams, taking into account these issues as far upstream as possible; • implementing appropriate technical and organisational solutions to reduce risks – bearing in mind that these risks evolve throughout the life of the projects; • restoration costs related to major climatic events may be partially covered by insurance companies. The environmental issues relating to the Group’s activities and their potential impact on the environment are detailed more specifi­ cally in section 2 of the Sustainability Statement. 1.2.3. Operational risks at Group level A distinction should be made between the risks common to the four divisions and those specific to each segment. Risks common to all four segments Risks associated with project execution The main characteristic of the Group’s main activities is the commitment made when submitting a proposal to perform a task that is by its nature unique, for a price with predetermined terms and within an agreed time schedule. The risks are mainly related to: • “upstream phase”, i.e. before the contract is signed: • poor assessment of the project or client; • design and costing errors; • errors in assessing the terms of the contract; • overestimation of available internal resources, and • poor evaluation of subcontracting. • “downstream phase”, i.e. after the contract is signed: • insufficient or inadequate staff and supplies; • difficult customer relations; • encountering the unexpected; • pollution or environmental accidents; • changes imposed by the client during the work; • poor contract management; • changes in the cost of materials and supplies; • supply chain disruption and shortages of raw materials and labour; Message from the Chairman and CEO Our ambitions and achievements Management report Sustainability statements Financial statements"
"Annual report 2024 - CFE 42 • limiting contractual responsibility for the entire project to a reasonable share of the contract amount; • capping penalties for delay and performance at an acceptable percentage of the contract amount; • providing for an adjustment of the contractual provisions (price, deadline) in the event of legislative, fiscal or regulatory changes; • inserting a force majeure clause (political risk, unilateral decision of the customer or granter, economic disruption, bad weather) or early termination of the project, and • ensuring that insurance cover is activated. Legislative and regulatory compliance Given the diversity of their activities and geographical locations, the Group’s different Business Units are exposed to a specific legis­ lative and regulatory environment which vary depending on the location where the services are provided and the professions con­ cerned. In particular, these must comply with the rules relating to: • the procedures for awarding and performing public or private law contracts; • construction law, particularly the technical rules governing the provision of services, supplies and works, and • environmental law, economic law, labour law, social law and competition law. The Group’s ability to adapt to new regulations and how it monitors standards enables it to significantly control legislative and reg­ ulatory risks. IT security risks In the digital and teleworking era, IT risks increasingly constitute threats that are liable to slow down the activities of the Business Units or compromise the integrity of their most valuable resources and data. The main IT risks are viruses and malware, fraudulent email, cyber-attacks, loss of confidential information, operating errors, risk of physical loss or theft, and misappropriation. CFE’s risk management measures can be summarised as follow: • installation of professional antivirus software on all workstations and servers, with regular updates; • installing additional authentication systems for technical users (administrators); • implementing Privileged Identity Management (“PIM”) controls to grant specific high-privilege actions only to standard IT users for a limited time and after approval by a central high-level expert; • installing security solutions for cloud solutions (SaaS) used by CFE and to secure Internet use : • using secure tunnels (“VPN”) to connect users working remotely ; • removing public access to critical applications via the Internet without a VPN; • delivering regular cyber security training and awareness-building sessions for all staff, sharing how to protect yourself from a cyber security attack (phishing, data theft etc.); • adding a professional service to Outlook for reporting and analysing “phishing” e-mails; • implementing an email protection solution that scans all incoming emails and blocks phishing attempts and known malware before they reach the inboxes of CFE employees; • implementing a well-configured and up-to-date complex password and multi-factor authentication strategy; • using external service providers to analyse systems and alert on anomalies pointing to a potential security incident; • using the Chief Information Security Officers to audit the implementation of our security policies; • commissioning a red teaming exercise carried out by an ethical hacker on some of the Group’s entities to check the effective­ ness of the security protection systems and their effective implementation; • restricting access to confidential and sensitive records according to user profiles: in this regard, records and resources are partitioned by department, with authentication; • setting up an effective backup system; • systematically training employees in the use of applications and software; • systematically checking each request for a new application against a security checklist to ensure that it complies by design with the Group’s security policies, or giving advice on their implementation, and • an annual assessment by the Group’s IT partner of its IT security and business continuity practices, using a maturity question­ naire. The year 2024 was characterised by numerous interventions by dedicated IT teams, with no significant consequences for the Busi­ ness Units concerned.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 100 age of 180 kWh/m2/year for office buildings, Wood Hub stands out as an exceptional NZEB (Nearly Zero Energy Building), designed for the future. The reduction potential of these actions is fairly limited (less than 1%), as total energy consumption in offices is very low compared with construction sites. Nevertheless, these actions are necessary to be consistent with other actions and to establish a real corporate culture around the challenges of climate change. Although we have taken advantage of most of the levers for reducing GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2, CFE continues to seek further optimisation of its energy consumption. The company regularly tests new pilot projects on its worksites, and closely monitors technological advances and innovations in this field. Particular attention is paid to construction site generators, for which current technology unfortunately does not yet meet market expectations. ESRS E1-3 29a, ESRS E1-3 AR21, ESRS E1-1 14, 16b,j, ESRS E1-4 34f, 16b To ensure that these various measures are followed up, and that worksites choose the solutions best suited to their situation, CFE has compiled all solutions that bring good results in a handbook called the ‘Greenbook’. By 2024, CFE has already achieved an absolute reduction of 25% in total scope 1 and 2 compared with the 2020 reference values. The expected results for 2024 were to achieve a 16% reduction on 2020 values. These excellent results are due in particular to the rapid adoption of on-site energy optimisation methods and an effective fleet greening policy.

However, total Scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2023 remain unchanged ESRS E1-3 29 b, ESRS E1-4 34 a,b Indirect emissions: Scope 3 In 2024, CFE carried out a complete analysis of its indirect emissions according to the GHG Protocol. This analysis highlighted the material categories of Scope 3 GHG emissions, which are “purchases of goods and services”, which accounts for 92% of emissions, “use of products sold”, which accounts for 7% of emissions, and to a lesser extent “goods and equipment”, which accounts for 1% of emissions. In the “purchases of goods and services” category, this analysis shows that a small category of materials is responsible for the majority of these emissions. These include concrete, steel, façade elements and, to a lesser extent, technical building instal­ lations such as HVAC, piping, cabling, etc. Taking into account this analysis, as well as current technologies, information and con­ struction methods, CFE has defined its objectives for 2030. CFE has carried out an in-depth study of the stated objectives of its value chain, in particular those of suppliers of materials with a high impact on GHG emissions. Based on this information, CFE has set itself the target of reducing its Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2030, based on 2024 values. A detailed reduction plan has yet to be drawn up, requiring a more granular analysis of the data. Specific targets for the “use of products sold” category will also be defined from 2025. The 20% reduction target applies to the entire CFE group. ESRS E1-3 AR21, ESRS E1-4 33, ESRS E1-4 34b As 2024 is the reference year, so far there are no measurable results from the actions undertaken. ESRS E1-3 29 b Lever 1 - Sustainable suppliers and materials The main lever for reducing scope 3 GHGs is therefore the commitment of suppliers who themselves have targets and reduction plans in line with the Paris agreements. Alongside this lever, CFE also wants to take a pro-active approach.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 102 other actions concern raising awareness or switching to alternative means of transport, which are included in the Group’s mobility plan. This plan takes into account all aspects of mobility (TCO, taxes, etc.) and does not involve any particular costs or investments. Levers 2 and 3: Energy consumption on site and in the offices To limit this, on-site consumption is monitored daily to prevent energy wastage, solar panels are being installed on the site barracks and more efficient generators are being used. There are no major costs associated with these actions, as the reduction in con­ sumption generally offsets the investment in equipment. These amounts are marginal. At the same time, a switch to green energy has already been in place since 2020. The relocation of CFE and its subsidiaries BPC, BPI, CLE, VMA and Van Laere to new buildings that consume very little energy (notably Wood Hub), as well as the renovation of other group headquarters, has also significantly reduced the group’s energy consumption. CFE has not identified any assets whose economic lifetime should be reduced. Note on CAPEX aligned with European taxonomy Capex plays an essential role in the development of sustainable activities. These relate to equipment and machinery, CFE’s own fleet and, to a lesser extent, CFE’s offices and production sites. In 2024, a total of EUR 27 million was invested in these categories, 13.97% of which was directly linked to sustainable projects, in accordance with the EU taxonomy. Indirect emissions: Scope 3 At this stage, it is too early to draw conclusions on the resources supporting the transition plan for Scope 3 emissions. It’s a complex subject because it concerns the entire value chain. A more detailed analysis will be carried out in 2025. Nevertheless, the initial trends are as follows: The CFE group’s activities will be developed to reduce costs in terms of CO2 emissions, particularly in terms of the choice of materi­ als and transporting materials and waste in the Construction & Renovation and Multitechnics segments. It is also expected that the proportion of renovation and energy-efficiency renovation work will increase as the regulatory framework evolves. The financial impact of the choice of materials or the development of new approaches to transport is estimated at the project submission stage and then incorporated into the commercial offer submitted to the customer. This study is carried out on a pro­ ject-by-project basis, so margins are re-evaluated at the start of each new order. On the other hand, a residual risk is the cost of the inefficiencies inherent in learning new production techniques or new approaches to logistics. This is because it is not always possi­ ble to anticipate (both at contractual level and when preparing for project implementation) and quantify with sufficient accuracy. The real estate business systematically includes solutions for reducing the energy consumption of buildings during the develop­ ment of new projects. In addition, renovation projects for existing buildings are becoming increasingly common. Once the land has been acquired to develop a project, a feasibility study is carried out. The cost price of the project is estimated and incorporated into the commercial offer made to customers. Specific framework To ensure that these actions are implemented, CFE has strengthened its management team with local Sustainability Officers work­ ing in the various Business Units, as well as a team working at the holding company to consolidate information and support local teams. The cost of this specific framework is included in “operating costs” as presented in the Financial Report on page 128. Further details will be provided from 2025 onwards. ESRS E1-3 29 ci, ESRS E1-1 16c The resources linked to the transition plan will be reassessed in greater detail in 2025 to analyse the costs linked to the scope 3 re­ duction plan, once this has been finalised. Similarly, an analysis will be made to take account of the 2050 targets and the corresponding reduction plan once it has been final­ ised. No significant capital investment is planned for economic activities related to thermal coal, nuclear power or fossil fuel.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 114 3.2.1. SBM2 Interests and views of stakeholders Collaboration and dialogue with subcontractors are essential elements of CFE’s group strategy. We consider them as important as our own workforce. By fostering open, ongoing communication, we ensure that subcontractors are fully integrated into our process­ es and share our safety and quality objectives. This collaborative approach strengthens relationships based on trust, improves co­ ordination on construction sites and ensures that everyone works together harmoniously and efficiently. By valuing the contributions of subcontractors and treating them as key partners, we create a safer, more productive working environment for all. ESRS 2 SBM-2 3.2.2. SBM3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model The DMA exercise (chap 1.5.1) has demonstrated that health and safety are material sub-themes for CFE and its subcontractors. In particular, there is a significant risk of negative impact, as accidents can occur on site, leading to serious incapacity, permanent after-effects and even death. The heart of CFE’s business happens on the construction sites. The work is carried out by CFE’s own workers or by subcontractors. At present, there’s no way of carrying out these projects without manpower. Every effort must therefore be made to limit these risks. CFE considers that it is just as important to fight to limit safety risks on site for its own workforce as for subcontractors, since every human being deserves to be treated equally in the face of danger. The analysis carried out in chapter 3.1.2 therefore also covers the entire value chain. ESRS S2-SBM-3 11 a,c 3.2.3. S2-1 Policies related to value chain workers CFE has adopted a series of policies that apply both to its own workforce and to the various parties involved on site. These include the Human Rights Policy and the QHSE Policy. These documents are described in detail in chapter 3.1.3. A Code of Conduct for commercial partners has also been drawn up. It includes an obligation to comply with the internal Code of Conduct, and in particular to respect the safety rules set out in the QHSE policy. The obligation to comply with local and European laws and regulations, as well as with the aforementioned policies, are an integral part of the contractual clauses for sub-contractors. ESRS S2-16, 17, 18, 19 3.2.4. S2-2 Processes for engaging with value chain workers about impacts Ongoing dialogue with the various parties involved on our worksites is a priority, and this primarily concerns safety. The onboarding of all subcontractors is formalised by means of a short training session introducing the site, the contact persons and the specific rules relating to the project. It is vital to ensure that everyone can identify the various stakeholders involved, and knows who to contact in the event of any problems. The site manager will ensure that all this information is understood by providing training in a language that the workers understand. Each team should have a manager who speaks one of the project’s national languages, to ensure that he or she can communicate with the site management teams at all times. Formal meetings are held at least once a week with subcontractors working on the site. To ensure that these meetings run smoothly, team leaders from the various subcontractors represent their companies. These meetings are followed by a clear report setting out the actions to be taken by the various parties involved, an update on the schedule and an overview of the phases to come. A LEAN and collaborative approach is adopted on all projects. Engagement with the value chain on worksites on safety issues, using a LEAN approach, is essential to ensure a safe and efficient working environment. Secondly, value chain mapping enables us to analyse each stage of the construction process, from design to delivery, and detect critical points where safety incidents may occur. A culture of safety must be established, with visible leadership where managers set the example by respecting and valuing safety practices and open communication. Finally, the monitoring and evaluation of safety performance, through key indicators and regular site visits, ensures compliance with standards and identifies areas for improvement. By integrating these LEAN principles into worksite safety management, it is possible to create a safer, more efficient and more col­ laborative working environment. The key lies in the commitment of all players in the value chain and in a culture of continuous im­ provement. Penalties are foreseen and communicated for any worker who does not respect the safety rules in force on projects.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 115 3.2.5. S2-3 Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise concerns To remedy negative impacts on sites, it is essential to put in place a structured process and effective communication channels. This process begins with the identification and assessment of potential impacts. This includes carrying out risk analyses to identify potential hazards and assess their severity and probability. At the start of site activities, each subcontractor is required to share this specific risk analysis with the site management team, in order to analyse the resources to be implemented and responsibilities to­ gether. Once the impacts have been identified, preventive and/or corrective measures must be implemented. This can include modifying work procedures, improving safety equipment, or training workers to better manage identified risks. It is crucial to document these measures and ensure that they are clearly communicated to all team members. To enable workers in the value chain to voice their concerns, several communication channels need to be established: Onboarding new workers: This onboarding provides information and training for new workers on a project. In particular, the organi­ sational chart of site management and their contact details are provided to facilitate future exchanges. Regular meetings: Weekly safety meetings are organised on projects where workers can discuss safety issues and propose solu­ tions. Direct communication lines: Subcontractors are encouraged to communicate any concerns or comments directly with site teams as a matter of priority. Mobile applications: On most worksites, a mobile app enables workers to report incidents or concerns quickly and easily. Security representatives: The site’s QHSE manager, along with the entire site management team, makes regular visits to the site, enabling direct interaction with all those involved. It’s also important to create a safety culture where workers feel comfortable reporting problems without fear of reprisal. This is en­ couraged by visible, committed leadership that values and respects workers’ contributions to safety. Finally, it is essential to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place, by tracking safety indicators. ESRS S2-3 27, 28 3.2.6. S2-4 Taking action on material impacts on value chain workers, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to value chain workers, and effectiveness of those actions Each project is unique and requires a specific risk analysis. This exercise must be carried out both by the project management team and by subcontractors. This analysis must be carried out before work begins, to enable a dialogue with the project’s management teams and to validate the most suitable working methods for limiting risks together. Scheduling will also be defined in such a way as to keep co-activities between workers to a minimum. Weekly site meetings allow us to see whether or not we need to adapt or correct the chosen work methods. Everyone involved in a project is jointly responsible for their own safety and that of others. On the other hand, subcontracting agree­ ments specify in detail the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. Among other things, it defines who is responsible for the breakdown and maintenance of collective protection equipment. Each subcontractor is responsible for his or her own personal protective equipment. On the other hand, the site management team will ensure that each employee uses the equipment correctly. The site management team will ensure that a responsible, collaborative and respectful site culture is in place. This working atmos­ phere facilitates communication and a genuine safety culture. Regular checks are carried out on site by the BU’s QHSE manager and by management teams. These visits enable us to identify safety shortcomings and correct them as quickly as possible. These visits are always accompanied by a visit report to ensure that every remark has been addressed. Control also involves regular monitoring and communication of safety indicators. A specific monthly dashboard also includes the number of incidents and accidents involving subcontractors. The management team will also ensure that subcontracting teams receive the necessary training. In the event of failure to comply with the established rules, penalties are applied. In the event of serious misconduct, the person responsible will be asked to leave the site with immediate effect and will not be allowed to return. CFE also monitors the company’s track record in terms of safety compliance and safety culture, and takes this into account when selecting subcontractors. CFE is not aware of any serious human rights problems or incidents linked to the upstream or downstream value chain (other than the site accidents listed in the following chapter).

ESRS G1.GOV-1_5a, ESRS G1.GOV-1_5b In particular, the “Business Integrity Policies” manual includes the following policies: • Gifts and entertainment policy • Policy on political involvement • Antitrust policy • International sanctions policy • Conflict of interest policy • Policy against bribery and corruption The Code of Conduct, while not exhaustive, deals with a set of general principles and ethical guidelines that can be applied at dif­ ferent levels of the Group and within the various Business Units. These include (among others): • Protecting teams and partners • diversity, equal opportunity and non-discrimination • health and safety • respect and freedom from harassment • data privacy • Ethical business conduct (this refers to the rules set out in the specific “Business Integrity Policies” manual described above) • Financial integrity • Themes relating to the environment, sustainability and respect for human rights and communities These various policies respect the International Bill of Human Rights (United Nations), the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (International Labour Organization) and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Respect for the human rights of every individual is essential to CFE and lies at the heart of our fundamental values. We respect and protect human rights and take care not to exploit anyone, wherever we work in the world. Everyone we do business with is held to the same standards. We will never tolerate slavery, child labour, forced or compulsory labour, or trafficking in human beings. We respect the fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our human rights policy is aligned with our Code and is overseen by CFE’s legal and human resources departments. In particular, as part of its human rights policy (https://www.cfe.be/fr/documents-de-la-societe), CFE is committed to respecting the eight fundamental ILO conventions. Specific policies on safety and diversity have also been implemented and communicated to all employees. 4.3. Specific objectives and monitoring of these policies The “code of conduct” and the various “business integrity policies” were completely revised in 2024. These documents are available on the intranet. To ensure knowledge and understanding of the rules contained therein, an online training cycle, which is mandatory for all employees, was rolled out during the last quarter of 2024 concerning the “Code of Conduct”, “Business Integrity Policies” and “Human Rights Policy”. ESRS G1-1 9, ESRS G1-1 10g, ESRS G1-3 20, 21a, 21b, 21c Alongside this training cycle, specific training courses and communication campaigns on cybersecurity, safety and diversity are also organised annually. Each entity regularly undergoes an analysis of risks and procedures by the internal audit unit. Internal audit is an independent func­ tion, and its main task is to support management and help it improve the management of risks. Internal audit reports functionally to the Audit Committee of CFE by submitting the annual audit plan and presenting the main findings of the audits carried out and a follow-up of the action plans. If necessary, additional audit assignments may be carried out at the request of the Audit Committee or of the Executive Committee of CFE. Employees are expected to be vigilant about the risks to which our Group could be exposed in the course of its activities.

The Holdings and Invest­ ment segment, of which CFE does not exercise exclusive control, only takes into account emissions linked to the head office. Emis­ sions come mainly from the fleet (cars, vans and trucks) and energy (gas and fuel oil) used on construction sites and at the Group’s various headquarters. The fleet alone accounts for 74% of these emissions. The emission factors used to calculate Scope 1 direct emissions are taken from the database www.CO2emissiefactoren.be. This database is regularly updated, and the factors taken into account relate to the year 2024. ESRS E1-6 AR39 b The accuracy level is 100% based on primary data. ESRS 2 BP-2 10 c Scope 2 – indirect emissions Scope 2 emissions, as reported according to the GHG protocol, are calculated for all group activities, with the exception of the In­ vestments and Holdings segment, for which CFE does not have operational management. They include indirect GHG emissions mainly arising from the production of electricity purchased and consumed by CFE and its subsidiaries. Scope 2 emissions based on location are calculated by multiplying purchased electricity volumes by the emission factors specific to each country. To calculate Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions using the market-based approach, CFE relies on green electricity contracts as the contractual instruments for the electricity purchased. In total, CFE’s commitment is reflected in the fact that 73% of the kWh purchased and con­ sumed uses green electricity. This percentage of green electricity corresponds fully to combined contractual instruments.

"Annual report 2024 - CFE 119 panies on people and the environment, as well as to evaluate the financial risks and opportunities arising from climate change and other sustainability issues. • DMA (Double Materiality Assessment): assesses both the impact of the company’s activities on the environment and society (from the inside out, impact materiality) and the impact of environmental and social issues on the company’s financial perfor­ mance (from the outside in, financial materiality). • DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion): This concerns the involvement of different points of view and the avoidance of discrimina­ tion, by promoting diversity in various areas, such as gender, religious beliefs and origins, as well as the implementation of a policy of inclusion. • DNSH (Do No Significant Harm): The concept of “Do No Significant Harm” (DNSH) is used in the EU Taxonomy as one of the con­ ditions for classifying an activity as “green”. This means that an economic activity must not only make a substantial contribu­ tion to one or more environmental objectives, but must also not cause significant harm to any of these objectives. • eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score): This is an indicator used to measure the likelihood of your employees recommending your organisation as a place to work. To calculate the eNPS, employees are asked the following question: “On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company as a good place to work?” The responses are then classified into three catego­ ries: • Detractors (scores from 0 to 6): employees who are not very satisfied and would not recommend the company. • Passive (scores of 7 to 8): employees who are satisfied but not enthusiastic, and who would not actively recommend the company. • Promoters (scores of 9 to 10): very satisfied employees who would actively recommend the company. The eNPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters, giving a score between -100 and 100. • EPB (Energy Performance of Buildings): This refers to the efficiency with which buildings use energy. • EPD (Environmental Product Declaration): Standardised document providing detailed information on the environmental im­ pact of a product throughout its life cycle. • ESG ( Environment, Social and Governance): This is a set of criteria used to assess a company’s sustainability and ethical impact • ESG (Policy): Statement setting out the company’s approach to environmental, social and governance issues, as well as the plan for achieving this, and the indicators used to measure progress. • ESRS (European Sustainability Reporting Standards): Companies subject to the CSRD will have to report in accordance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Standards are adapted to EU policies, while drawing on and contribut­ ing to international standardisation initiatives. • EU Taxonomy: regulations that determine which investments can be classified as ‘green’ and which contribute to the realisa­ tion of the EU Green Deal. The classification is based on technical screening criteria (TSC) and minimum criteria to avoid signif­ icant harm (DNSH). • Frequency rate: The frequency rate measures the number of accidents at work resulting in at least one day’s absence from work per million hours worked. It is used to assess the degree to which employees are exposed to occupational risks. • GHG - scope 1: all direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company (e.g. fleet, fuel and natural gas combus­ tion). • GHG - scope 2: all indirect emissions from the production of electricity purchased by the company. Scope 2 emissions occur physically at the facility where the electricity is generated. • GHG - scope 2 location based: This method calculates emissions using the average emission factor of the electricity network where the energy is consumed. It reflects the average emissions intensity of local electricity networks • GHG- scope 2 market based: This method calculates emissions based on the electricity that organisations have chosen to purchase, often specified in contracts or instruments such as renewable energy certificates (RECs). It takes into account the company’s specific energy supply choices. • GHG – scope 3: indirect emissions from a company’s activities, such as emissions from the production of sourced products (upstream) or from products, services or projects sold by the company (downstream). • GHG protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol): A standardised global framework for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. It provides the most widely used standards for GHG emissions accounting, helping companies, countries and cities to track their progress towards climate goals. • Human Rights: Rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. • ILO (International Labour Organization) : This is a specialised agency of the United Nations. Its mandate is to promote social and economic justice by establishing international labour standards • IRO (Impact, Risks and Opportunities); • Impacts: The effects that the company’s activities have on the environment and society. • Risks: The potential threats facing the company, such as climate or financial risks. • Opportunities: Potential opportunities for development and innovation • JV (Joint Venture): This is a commercial partnership in which two or more companies join forces to carry out a joint project.
