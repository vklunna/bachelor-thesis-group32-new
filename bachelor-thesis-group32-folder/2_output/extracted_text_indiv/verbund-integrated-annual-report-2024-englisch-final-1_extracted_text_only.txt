"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 233 the reduction targets provided the applicable actions are implemented. In particular, the planned actions include the ongoing replacement of natural gas-powered compressors, the increased use of recompression systems to avoid methane emissions, and leak detection and repair (LDAR) programmes. VERBUND’s greenhouse gas and energy-intensive plants and products are factored into the Climate Transition Plan and the related plans are explained here. No CapEx amounts related to economic activities in connection with coal and oil were invested in the reporting year. In 2024, a total of €39.9m was invested in economic activities related to gas, of which €4.5m was taxonomy-aligned and €35.4m was taxonomy-eligible. The Climate Transition Plan was developed on the basis of the general Group strategy and is consistent with VERBUND’s financial planning. Performance tracking is integrated into the annual strategy process. This integrated planning was approved by the VERBUND AG’s Group Executive Board, and presented to the Supervisory Board’s Strategy and Sustainability Committee. Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model The following material impacts have been identified in relation to VERBUND’s business activities: VERBUND is contributing to the decarbonisation of the electricity system through its business model and strategic focus on the expansion of renewable energies. This makes it possible to reduce GHG emissions. On the other hand, VERBUND generates GHG emissions through the use of fossil fuels, thereby exacerbating climate change. Material impacts across the value chains result from procurement of goods, electricity sales and natural gas sales. Indirect GHG emissions are emitted across the upstream and downstream value chain, which exacerbates climate change. The following financially material risk drivers, which may be influenced positively and/or negatively by factors directly or indirectly related to climate change, have been identified: electricity price trends (depending on carbon prices, the generation energy mix, etc.), CapEx (depending on rising procurement prices, etc.), regulatory framework conditions, extreme weather events, the volatility of the generation volume and necessary technological adaptations. The impacts, risks and opportunities are taken into account in VERBUND’s strategy and business model. The three strategic focus areas of the VERBUND Strategy 2030 and Mission V strategy focus on a sustainable future in which electricity generation from renewable energy sources plays an even greater role. Details on the resilience of the strategy and business model with respect to climate change as well as further disclosures can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1 and ESRS 2 SBM-3.

"238 by reducing the specific Scope 1 GHG emissions by 90%, and by reducing the intensity of Scope 3 GHG emissions attributable to electricity sales by 98% relative to 2020 as the base year. GHG reduction goal 2050 – net zero: VERBUND is committed to achieving net zero GHG emissions from 2050 onwards (a reduction of at least 90% of greenhouse gas emissions and the elimination of residual emissions) starting in 2020 as the base year with the exclusion of GHG emissions generated by capital goods in order to achieve decarbonisation of the energy system (expansion of renewable energy). The aim is to reduce GHG emissions to an unavoidable minimum level and to use recognised actions to neutralise a maximum of 10% of residual emissions. Indirect GHG emissions in Category 2 are attributable at VERBUND to upstream GHG emissions from capital goods with the aim of decarbonising the energy system. These GHG emissions are reported transparently, but are excluded from the scope of the target, as the capital goods in question are aimed at increasing and diversifying renewable generation capacities, and expanding and modernising the electricity grid (for more information, see the Taxonomy Regulation disclosures in the EU taxonomy section). Therefore, these targets are not consistent with the boundaries of the GHG inventory. These investments make an important contribution to the transition to clean energy, and are not linked to locked-in emissions. Capital expenditure invested in grid expansion also facilitates the integration of new wind farms and photovoltaic installations. The VERBUND 2030 strategy provides for an expansion of renewable generation assets, grids and storage, which will lead to an increase in both the renewables generation capacity and in indirect GHG emissions in Category 2 (Capital goods) in the years these generation assets are brought into operation. Reducing this emissions category is not compatible with VERBUND’s strategy of expanding the renewable energy sector. The expansion of renewable energies contributes to reducing VERBUND’s GHG emissions and those of many other companies and countries. Sector coupling allows electricity generated from renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels in the thermal energy and transport sectors. Targets and actions aimed at expanding renewable energies, increasing energy efficiency and achieving the technological and geographical diversification of generation facilities are defined in order to manage further climate-related risks and opportunities. The levers for reducing GHG emissions by 2030 include reducing the use of fossil fuels, purchasing electricity from renewable energy for grid losses (where approved by the regulator) and distributing electricity from renewables generation to industrial customers. Scope 1 accounts for 4%, Scope 2 for 6%, and Scope 3 for 90% of the total contributions to the target achievement of 74% (see also “GHG emissions table” under E1-6). In terms of net zero, the target for 2050 defined by VERBUND’s Executive Board is to achieve a reduction of at least 90% and remove residual emissions. The contributions to reducing Scope 1 emissions are mainly achieved by replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen, for Scope 2 by purchasing electricity from renewable energy for all energy consumption, and for Scope 3 through further reductions in the supply chain. In the 2020 base year, a total of 6,258 kt CO2e was calculated for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as well as Scope 3 emissions. These emissions are used to calculate the reduction targets with the exclusion of Category 2, with 6,242 kt CO2e thereby serving as the basis for defining the target. The targets for the emissions intensity of electricity generation and electricity sales are based on the absolute targets. The intensity target for electricity generation refers to the ratio of Scope 1 emissions from the electricity generation and electricity transport sector to total generation. The Scope 3 intensity target is determined on the basis of the ratio of Scope 3 emissions from the sale of purchased electricity to the total sales of electricity to consumers. Accordingly, the target includes the emission sources associated"

Recalculations of the CCF are performed and documented in the event of material changes or errors. Regardless of whether they cause the values to rise or fall, they are considered material if they account for more than 5% of the relevant scope in the base year or reporting year. The acquisition of the gas network operator Gas Connect Austria was taken into account in the base year in accordance with the requirements of the GHG Protocol, producing a 13% increase in Scope 1 emissions in 2020. The electricity consumption of Gas Connect Austria for Scope 2 market-based emissions was recalculated, GHG emissions from the grid purchases of power plants were reallocated on the basis of CSRD requirements, and the emission factor for the unknown electricity mix was changed to reflect the EU mix. In total, market-based Scope 2 emissions rose by 11% in 2020. Notably, the target for Scope 3 emissions produced by electricity sales to consumers required a transition from the location- based approach to the market-based approach in order to allow the figure to be controlled through the active and successive transition to renewable energy among industrial customers. This led to an increase in emissions Category 3 in 2020. The inclusion of Category 15 Investments in accordance with the requirements of ESRS standards and their significance, led to a further increase in Scope 3 emissions. In total, Scope 3 emissions then rose by 21% in 2020. All changes in the GHG emissions calculation, such as the inclusion of non-consolidated companies, the transition to a market-based approach for electricity sales to consumers and the inclusion of investments, were taken into account in all Scopes in 2023. This produced a 0% change in Scope 1 emissions, a 4% increase in Scope 2 location-based emissions, and a 6% decrease in Scope 2 market- based emissions, with Scope 3 emissions falling by 1%. Consistent reporting and comparability between the previous year (2023) and the new 2024 reporting period is thereby ensured.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 249 Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing As an energy supplier and electricity producer, carbon pricing is a key cost factor for VERBUND that needs to be included in corporate decisions at every level. The VERBUND business strategy is based on modelled future business scenarios. Carbon pricing is one of the metrics used to develop these scenarios, which include energy market performance in Europe and impacts on VERBUND power plants. Carbon prices also play a key role in assessing future generation technologies and investment decisions. Given that carbon prices are expected to rise substantially over the coming years, the incentive to reduce GHG emissions while increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable energies, and investing in the development of low-carbon technologies will grow. This is in line with VERBUND’s strategic projects and supports the achievement of climate-related goals. The internal carbon price forms part of the assumptions applicable to the internal VERBUND Energy Market Model (VEMM). The results of the VEMM are used for budget planning, investment decisions and impairment testing VERBUND’s power plants. The incorporated internal carbon price is based on the EU ETS price and forms part of VERBUND’s planning assumptions. These planning assumptions must be applied by all parts of VERBUND, both when making investment decisions and reviewing existing plants. As all of the Group’s divisions are located in EU member states, the internal carbon price is applied throughout the Group. Around 479,000 tonnes, or 96% of VERBUND’s Scope 1 emissions, are measured using the internal carbon price. Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions are not included in the internal carbon pricing. All current applications use the carbon price, which corresponds to the current prices listed on the stock exchange (ICE, EEX). The long-term performance of the carbon price is based on assumptions made by international consulting firms. An average price from all available external scenarios is used as the base scenario for determining the long-term performance of carbon prices. Price forecasts are used to measure the value in use, determine fair values and ascertain the impairment of assets. More details are available in the consolidated financial statements. The prices applied in 2024 were in the region of €67/t CO2e. VERBUND expects carbon prices to rise sharply in the long term.

"252 ESRS E3 Water and marine resources ESRS 2 General Disclosures VERBUND is committed to the sustainable and responsible use of water. The strategic focus of the VERBUND Group on renewable generation technologies and the associated decommissioning of thermal power plants powered by hard coal, lignite and crude oil are the factors that had the greatest impact on the conservation of water resources. Since 2020, natural gas has only been used for generation at one site, and the partial recirculation of the cooling water also offers high savings potential at the same site. Generation from hydropower plays only a minor role with regard to the topics covered by this standard, as the hydropower plant operations utilise the potential and kinetic energy of water and convert this energy into electricity. In the process, the water is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively changed and is not consumed. As a result, the water flowing through hydropower plant turbines is returned directly to the body of water concerned without any changes to its biochemical composition. Since all of VERBUND’s storage power plants are annual or daily storage plants, they are not used for long-term water storage over the course of several years. Compared with energetic utilisation, in terms of volume, the withdrawal of cooling water and service water at hydropower plants is of minor significance and these withdrawals are also returned. Effluent is either discharged through the public sewer system, or, at sites that are not connected to the public sewer system, is discharged after it is treated in line with the statutory provisions or official notices from the authority. Potential hydropower-specific impacts on water habitats are described under Biodiversity and ecosystems (see section E4 SBM-3). Wind farms and photovoltaic installations, gas grid systems and power grid installations only withdraw, discharge and consume small quantities of water. The offices and administrative sites at these facilities consume drinking water, and the only water discharged into the water system is of household quality. Once specific activities are planned or initiated, the business activities related to the production, storage or transport of hydrogen set forth in the VERBUND strategy will be analysed in more detail with respect to their impacts, risks and opportunities in connection with the use of water resources.

Disclosure requirement E3-1 – Policies related to water and marine resources VERBUND’s environmental mission statement stipulates the Group-wide commitment to preventing or mitigating environmental impacts. The statement also sets forth action to reduce emissions, make efficient use of resources and preserve and promote biodiversity. Potential negative impacts arising from water withdrawals are avoided to the greatest possible extent at VERBUND. Water withdrawals are only relevant at the Mellach site of VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH, which is committed to continuously improving the environmental situation. In addition to ISO 14001 certification, the Mellach thermal generation facilities are validated according to the EMAS III Regulation. EMAS is therefore the central policy.

"268 expenditure in the region of €400m has been earmarked for the implementation of these environmental actions at rivers by 2027 (see section E4-4). VERBUND has started to conduct feasibility studies for all bodies of water affected by hydropeaking to reduce the impacts of hydropeaking and drops on water habitats. Work on three stretches of water is currently in the report preparation phase following the completion of active adaptions. Residual water studies were initiated at 13 diversion power plants in Styria to assess residual water discharge. Initial preparatory work began in 2024 and the project will be completed in the course of 2025. Rehabilitation measures that have already been implemented and are currently planned in connection with a turbine replacement not only promote the energy yield of existing power plants, but also reduce turbine-related damage to fish through limited clearance measures and improved turbine geometries. Measures are being implemented on the Inn River in partnership with the WWF, the Natopia Association, Naturium Inn, and the Technical University of Munich as part of the INNsieme action plan. The project aims to improve biodiversity and restore a vibrant Inn River through integrated pilot measures and runs from 2023 to 2026. It consists of three modules: species protection measures, restoration of ecological networks and publicity. Three restoration projects are being planned as part of the restoration of ecological networks module. These projects are being executed as part of a participatory planning process in which the public is actively involved. The aim is to reconnect lateral tributaries and improve the continuity of the river network. Gravel spawning grounds and juvenile fish habitats will be created or restored in the process. In detail, the plans already include a flow-through distributary in the tailrace of the Perach power plant. Concepts for optimised bedload management will also be developed and implemented. LIFE projects LIFE projects are often implemented in close coordination with the responsible ministry, the waterway operator viadonau, the National Park Donau-Auen, the offices of the state governments, the state fishing associations, and the landowners. VERBUND is currently involved in five LIFE projects on the rivers Danube, Inn and Enns rivers: LIFE Network Danube+ (2019–2024), LIFE Riverscape Lower Inn (2020– 2028), LIFE Blue Belt Danube Inn (2021–2029), LIFE Wild Island (2021–2027), and LIFE Nature WeNatureEnns (2024–2031). The following measures are being taken as part of these projects: • Fish passes constructed as semi-natural bypasses, where possible, in line with the pursuit of nature- based solutions; • Lateral expansion of rivers to promote dynamic riparian zones; • Desedimentation measures in the foodplains along the river; • Structuring measures in the vicinity of reservoir heads to promote the formation of islands and distributaries; • Forest management measures to promote protected riparian forest habitats; • Ecological upkeep measures, including on river embankments to promote protected dry sites; and • Management of non-native and invasive species. Kilometre stretches of semi-natural rivers have already been created around the power plants in Ottensheim, Abwinden-Asten, Greifenstein, Altenwörth, Ering-Frauenstein and Braunau-Simbach. Over the coming years, semi-natural bypasses will also be built at the power plants in Jochenstein and Egglfing,"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 269 and fish passes at all power plants on the Danube and Inn Rivers will allow fish to migrate to key habitats largely unhindered. Large island distributary systems have already been implemented downstream of the Ottensheim- Wilhering and Ering-Frauenstein power plants and are planned for further sites as part of LIFE projects. Measures for the de-sedimentation of silted-up-foodplains have already been implemented on the Inn and Danube rivers, and will be implemented in many more reservoirs over the coming years, starting at the Aschach and Jochenstein reservoirs. Research Several research projects are conducting scientific studies to explore sustainable, ecologically effective actions in river habitats over the course of several years. The aim is to enhance the value of the aquatic habitat while continuing to meet society’s high expectations when it comes to sustainable, economically viable hydropower generation. In the ÖkoResch project, for example, researchers from the BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences will be scientifically monitoring planned measures to limit hydropeaking and studying the effect of new residual water releases on aquatic habitats in alpine regions. Research will be conducted over the course of six years (2020–2026). The long duration of the project stems primarily from the necessary field work in the high-alpine habitat. These research activities are carried out in bodies of water affected by hydropeaking and semi-natural reference waters. Dotation tests are also being conducted at representative test sites. At VERBUND, the Hundskehlbach catchment is currently being investigated. Based on the analyses, an ecological assessment and monitoring system will be developed by the end of the project. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sediment Research and Management (BOKU) is evaluating ecologically compatible options for sediment remobilisation. In addition, a new sensor method is being studied at the Gries power plant on the Salzach River to record the beginning and end of bedload transport during water lowering processes. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Meta Ecosystem Dynamics in Riverine Landscapes (MERI) (BOKU) is analysing the long-term added value of selected LIFE projects on the Danube. The fish bypass project in partnership with Graz University of Technology and engineering offices that specialise in the environment is dedicated to the effects of transverse structures on the fish population, which are assessed in the laboratory and at the sites themselves. The project results will be published and presented at conferences in Germany and Austria in 2025. In collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, the migration behaviour and habitat use of selected fish species are being closely studied in the Inn River with the use of fish tagging based on PIT tags. PIT tag antennas were installed at a total of 25 sites, 12 of which were equipped with fish passes, to analyse the tagged fish. In collaboration with the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, the impacts of the restoration measures at the Ering-Frauenstein power plant were examined to determine the population dynamics of selected fish species. The project was completed in late 2023 with the findings subsequently presented and published in international publications in 2024. Terrestrial actions In the future, additional measures will be taken to promote biodiversity in the terrestrial ecosystems of green spaces owned by VERBUND. Easy-to-implement measures for the management, procurement and design of green spaces at VERBUND are set forth in an internal VERBUND catalogue of biodiversity"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 271 setting up environmentally optimised dam maintenance at the power plants in Egglfing-Obernberg, Ering-Frauenstein and Braunau-Simbach in Bavaria. To minimise potential negative impacts of wind turbines on populations and habitats, independent environmental agencies and the related authorities have prescribed a range of actions to be taken as part of environmental assessments. For one, many sites require periodic monitoring of bird and bat populations, often in conjunction with related adjustments to operations and temporary plant shutdowns for certain observed species or specified circumstances, such as the harvest period for cornfields. Environmental compensation areas are also being set up for birds of prey, owls, and other birds at certain sites, including Mariengarten and Göttlesbrunn, to provide substitute habitats that are extensively cultivated or planted with forage crops at a suitable distance from wind turbines. Sections of the land may be mowed on a rare or partial basis to ensure cover is maintained for small mammals, deer and ground nesting species. Another area in the green space is kept mown to provide a biotope where birds of prey can hunt. In order to promote biodiversity, (mineral) fertilisers and pesticides are not permitted in these compensation areas. Following the construction phase of new wind farms, temporary access routes and crane parking spaces are reduced to a minimum and restored to their original condition. Other measures related to wind farms include replacement or reforestation of prescribed tree species, as well as the protection and developmental upkeep of trees and shrubs. Action plans have been established for open-field solar installations in Austria and Spain, both for the construction phase and for the operation of the installations. These related measures may be one-off or recurring, and follow the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy. For instance, to prevent negative impacts on biodiversity, construction times and any necessary clearing work are adapted to the breeding behaviour of native species, as is the case at the installations in Mitterkirchen and Ludmannsdorf. Valuable habitats are not touched during construction or, where this is not possible, restored after construction. Permeable fences are also built to facilitate the unhindered passage of wild animals, for example at the La Solana installation in Spain. Restoration measures taken after the construction of installations include replanting native plants affected by the construction work. Compensatory measures can include the establishment of insect hotels, wildflower strips on the edge of the installation, or planting new trees and shrubs on the installation land to create additional habitats. In Austria, care is also taken to ensure extensive land cultivation without fertilisation and with the removal of mowed grass clippings. As part of mowing management, attention is paid to ensuring that animals such as partridges remain protected by visual cover and to the management of non-native and invasive species. An example of this approach can be found at the photovoltaic installation in Güssing, which opened in 2024. Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH also take measures to maintain and promote biodiversity and base their actions on the mitigation hierarchy as a matter of course. This helps to both minimise the environmental impacts in relation to the grid and avoid unnecessary environmental impacts from the outset. In addition to statutory requirements, special consideration is given to species protection in projects undertaken by Gas Connect Austria GmbH. As part of its sustainable habitat management, Austrian Power Grid AG has a long history of implementing environmental and species protection measures in relation to the power grid that go far beyond the stringent legal requirements. The Gas Connect Austria GmbH gas network and the Austrian Power Grid AG electricity grid lead through various landscape areas in Austria. Depending on the region, the climate, the naturally occurring circumstances and the type of use by humans, Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH routes pass through various landscapes, including forests, grasslands and farmland. The route corridors not only contain the power lines and pipelines, but also provide valuable habitats for flora and fauna."
"272 When planning the construction of new gas pipelines and high-voltage power lines, the aim is always to plan the route such that it avoids sensitive areas (nature reserves, bird sanctuaries, biotopes, natural and archaeological monuments, etc.). If this is not possible, nature conservation experts are consulted to determine whether interfering with nature can be avoided to the greatest possible extent. At Gas Connect Austria GmbH, biodiversity measures include ecological site supervision, compliance with guidelines for proper soil recultivation, reforestation, regulatory monitoring, management of non- native and invasive species, relocation of protected species and wildlife corridors. At Austrian Power Grid AG, for example, CEF measures have been introduced to ensure the continuous ecological functionality of the habitats in which the wood grouse is found. In addition, numerous amphibian spawning grounds along with nesting areas and woodpiles have been established to compensate for encroaching on the terrestrial ecosystem. Bird conservation is of particular importance for Austrian Power Grid AG. When constructing overhead line systems, special care is taken to observe the breeding periods of rare species along with other measures. Numerous nesting aids for endangered bird species have been installed on electricity pylons and around lines. For example, if the habitat of gophers is affected during line construction, they are temporarily resettled for the duration of the construction work until their habitat is restored. Nature and species protection experts as well as local residents contribute their experience in resettling the gophers. Compensatory measures and spaces are defined in the planning phase and are legally secured through land purchases or long-term lease agreements. Current biodiversity measures in connection with construction projects are reported for Austrian Power Grid AG in the year during which new installations are put into initial operation. Every year, experts from various specialist fields are invited to participate in the Austrian Power Grid AG nature conservation meeting to share their experiences, engage in scientific debate and talk to stakeholders. VERBUND has been implementing a wide range of decarbonisation measures and is indirectly working to mitigate biodiversity loss by expanding renewable energy generation and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Please consult section E1 Climate change for more information. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E4-4 – Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems VERBUND has set itself the goal of investing around €400m between 2002 and 2027 in environmental measures such as constructing fish passes and restoring stretches of rivers. By the end of 2024, €194m had already been allocated to corresponding measures, as described in the previous section. Of the 92 installations required to ensure fish passage at present, 71 had achieved fish passability by the end of 2024. In base year 2021, upon the launch of the third National River Basin Management Plan in Austria, this figure stood at 66. By 2027, 89 installations are expected to be passable, subject to the timely receipt of the required public permits. Both corporate targets include VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH, Grenzkraftwerke GmbH and VERBUND Innkraftwerke GmbH as well as Ennskraftwerke AG. They primarily address the impacts of hydropower on the river ecosystem, particularly on the historically altered river morphology, the barrier function, and the associated impacts on the development of the fish population. The targets cover the catchment areas of the Danube, Drau, Salzach, Enns, Mur and Inn rivers in Austria and Bavaria. These targets have been allocated to the restoration step of the mitigation hierarchy. Restoring the passability of major rivers is one of the objectives set out in the European Water Framework Directive. This Directive was enshrined in Austrian law by the Third National River Basin"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 273 Management Plan in 2021 and in Germany by the coordinated management plan (2022–2027). Among other things, the plans specify which stretches of river are to be morphologically restored to achieve good ecological condition or good ecological potential of the surface water bodies, and where measures for passability and residual water discharges need to be implemented. The international and national requirements are based on ecological thresholds for river basins. VERBUND uses these findings to improve its knowledge and contributes to the sustainable use and improvement of bodies of water through its targets and actions. In addition, VERBUND targets are linked to the restoration of freshwater ecosystems objective set in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Fish and all organisms found in and around the water habitat benefit from fish passes and the many bypass channels around them. Ecological thresholds for monitoring the functionality of fish passes are set forth by the responsible federal ministry in the form of guidelines. The functionality of fish passes and compliance with the requirements must be verified by VERBUND in the context of monitoring and corresponding reports. In Bavaria, the Technical University of Munich carries out comprehensive functionality monitoring in coordination with the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection. If compensation measures are required in relation to the implementation of semi-natural projects (e.g. for clearing work to reconnect silted distributaries), these are ordered by the authorities and executed alongside project implementation. However, these measures are not subject to any set targets. Sustainability commitments have been developed for wind and photovoltaics, including biodiversity commitments. Through these commitments, VERBUND aims to achieve biodiversity net gains by 2030 for wind and photovoltaic projects. Specific targets for biodiversity net gains in the construction and operation of installations are currently being developed on the basis of these commitments. These targets include the development of comprehensive biodiversity concepts for wind farms and open-field solar installations. The aim is to not only minimise the negative impacts of infrastructure projects on the environment, but also to actively contribute to promoting biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats. For further business areas, compliance with policies and the implementation of measures related to biodiversity will be ensured through environmental management systems, annually updated action plans, monitoring requirements and the schedule of legal provisions, as well as through external certifications. These plans concern one-off, ongoing measures to be implemented at defined intervals. Progress of the measures is documented at least once a year. Disclosure Requirement E4-5 – Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change At VERBUND, 128 sites with a potential negative impact on protected areas are located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas (see table for E4 SBM 3). Of this amount, 6,242 hectares comprise land that is either owned by VERBUND or which is under third-party ownership with easements (servitude) for VERBUND. The number of fish passes completed is used as a metric for determining changes in the passability of rivers. As of the end of 2024, a total of 71 VERBUND power plant sites, including Ennskraftwerke AG, were passable for fish. This corresponds to 76% of the run-of-river power plants. Plans for a further eleven run- of-river power plants are already in the advanced stage, and completion is planned for 2025 and 2026. Construction of the fish passes at the Rosenheim power plant (Inn River), the Laufnitzdorf and Bodendorf power plants (Mur River), as well as the Landl (Enns River) and Sölk power plants (Donnersbach River) is scheduled to begin in 2025. The metric “Number of fish passes” covers both the restoration of the"
"274 structural continuity of ecosystems and the functional connectivity in freshwater bodies. In order to check the functionality of fish passes, fish monitoring is carried out upon completion of newly built passes. Fish passes Base year Comparison (N-1) (N) 2021 2023 2024 Sites Number 66 69 71 More than 80% of VERBUND wind turbines and all open-field solar installations throughout Europe are already accompanied by environmental measures during construction and operation. Compensation, offsetting and substitute measures as well as ensuring environmental continuity are the most common measures. The majority of wind turbines are monitored on an annual basis. While bird and bat populations are usually checked, plant species and native animal species are also frequently monitored. ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy ESRS 2 General Disclosures VERBUND recognises the need to implement a fully functional circular economy at national and international level without delay. Accordingly, VERBUND strives to expand on measures implemented to date on the topics of resource efficiency and circular economy and to identify further relevant topics. VERBUND wants to contribute to a successful circular economy. Measures already implemented include, for example, the utilisation of by-products from thermal energy generation as well as comprehensive maintenance programmes for VERBUND facilities. These initiatives are aimed at extending the service life of VERBUND facilities, reducing the use of raw materials and minimising the generation of waste in the long term. Impact, risk and opportunity management The provision of electricity requires the construction and maintenance of various types of power plants along with the necessary related infrastructure. For this reason, both resource inflows and waste were categorised as material topics. More information on the assessment methodology applied in the double materiality assessment and on how affected communities were involved in the process is described in the section ESRS 2 IRO-1. The following sections discuss the approaches to managing identified opportunities and risks, allocated actions and resources, and related key metrics and targets. Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material resource use and circular economy-related impacts, risks and opportunities Topic-specific disclosures on processes to identify and assess material resource use and circular economy-related impacts, risks and opportunities can be found in the section ESRS 2 IRO-1."
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 275 Disclosure Requirement E5-1 – Policies related to resource use and circular economy At VERBUND, the management of impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy is of importance when it comes to keeping primary resource consumption to a minimum while maximising the circularity of waste streams. A comprehensive Group-wide approach to conserving resources and the circular economy is yet to be established as the related direct impacts on the environment are considered to be low compared to the other environmental topics. However, VERBUND has launched an analysis process to evaluate the aspects of the circular economy relevant to the Group. The aim is to develop a circular economy strategy that generates both environmental and economic benefits for society and for VERBUND. The VERBUND Executive Board has already adopted and regularly updates executive orders that define responsibilities and areas of responsibility in relation to materials management and sustainability management within the Group. The following ecological criteria have been established to support the transition to a circular economy at VERBUND: Responsible use of natural raw materials and resources. VERBUND records the proportion of renewable energy sources in its total energy consumption and monitors the development of energy consumption and materials on an annual basis. Waste management represents another important topic. VERBUND is committed to ensuring the prevention, recovery, reuse, and proper collection and treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. As a result, all waste is handed over for appropriate recovery or disposal. VERBUND is focused on optimising its existing operational processes and efficiently reducing waste streams. Following the coal phase-out, the volume of waste generated has been on the decline. However, greater waste streams are expected in the long term due to recent photovoltaic and wind installations. Waste management at VERBUND follows the principles of the European Union’s five-step waste hierarchy: waste prevention before preparation for reuse, before recycling, before recovery and before disposal. The VERBUND Group Waste Coordinator and their deputy monitor waste management and provide advice based on the VERBUND Waste Management work instruction. The Group waste coordinators are responsible for administration and knowledge management with regard to waste management at VERBUND. They review the appointment of waste officers and their deputies on an annual basis, assist with submitting reports to the authorities, update work instructions, identify training needs, organise trainings and hold coordination meetings. Responsibility for compliance with the legal requirements rests with the respective managers. Procurement takes place in accordance with the specially defined executive order for materials management and the VERBUND procurement guidelines, which stipulate that materials management must be carried out in accordance with the business principles and with due regard to the corporate mission statement, the corporate objectives and sustainability. Accordingly, economic, environmental and social criteria must be taken into account in award decisions, both for procurement and for sales. In addition to the executive orders, a Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has been established for the management of resource inflows to ensure resource-efficient waste and materials management at VERBUND and all subsidiaries. Resource inflows related to procurement are subject to this Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). Among other things, the Group-wide SCoC provides recommendations for VERBUND contractors on resource use and circular economy. The SCoC applies to all suppliers and business partners that supply products or services to the Group, including both domestic and"
