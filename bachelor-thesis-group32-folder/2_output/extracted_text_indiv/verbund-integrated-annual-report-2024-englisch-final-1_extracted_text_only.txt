"230 Environment VERBUND respects the right of present and future generations to an intact and habitable world. For this reason, VERBUND is working to prevent or reduce negative environmental impacts of its entrepreneurial activities, plants, products and services. VERBUND therefore contributes to achieving national and international environmental and climate targets and supports the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. VERBUND’s overarching voluntarily-defined environmental principles are enshrined in its publicly available environmental mission statement. The principles listed here are applicable as the basis for all material environmental topics identified from ESRS E1 to ESRS E5 in accordance with the materiality assessment. In addition, with its Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), VERBUND requires its employees, suppliers and partners to uphold environmentally friendly practices, and it encourages the same from its customers. The Code of Conduct therefore encompasses policies related to the environmental topics of climate change, biodiversity and resource use. At Group level, a dedicated environmental guideline fosters a standardised framework for coordinating, implementing and improving environmental agendas within the VERBUND Group. It accordingly defines the principles and organisation of environmental agendas as well as the roles, responsibilities and tasks of the individuals involved in environmental matters. This ensures the integration of environmentally relevant rules and regulations, structures and processes into the existing organisational structure at all operational levels and the exchange of information regarding topics relevant to the environment. VERBUND’s two independent grid subsidiaries, Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH are not subject to the internal rules and regulations due to the unbundling regulations. Both independent companies implement environmental principles through their externally certified environmental management system. The general organisation of responsibilities is described in ESRS 2 GOV-1. The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) has also been established to address environmental matters. This Group-level committee, comprising the executive management of all subsidiaries and the divisional heads of the VERBUND holding company, is chaired by the Executive Board member responsible for environmental issues, and is concerned with relevant environmental topics. The Group Executive Board approves both the environmental mission statement, the Code of Conduct for sustainable corporate governance and Group-wide strategic environmental goals. The executive management of VERBUND subsidiaries is responsible for the operational implementation of external and internal environmental regulations, the Group’s environmental policy (the environmental mission statement) and the strategic environmental objectives as well as the environmental agendas for the respective company. The aforementioned implementation and externally certification of environmental management systems in accordance with ISO 14001 or the EMAS Regulation ensures that all mandatory commitments are met, environmental impacts documented, environmental data externally verified and targets and actions adopted to improve environmental performance at the companies. When planning, making decisions and taking action, VERBUND always takes the associated environmental impacts into account. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1."
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 231 ESRS E1 Climate change Climate change is an issue of great importance for VERBUND. VERBUND is therefore working on sustainable, diversified solutions for the future of energy in all its business areas. The focus on electricity generation from renewable energy together with the consumption and distribution of renewable energy is a crucial factor in both reducing and avoiding greenhouse gas emissions. The Group’s strategic orientation takes into account requirements such as the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and international climate change treaties. Moreover, it also accounts for the public’s heightened awareness of climate change. VERBUND generates the majority of its electricity from renewable hydropower, wind power and solar power, and uses energy efficiently. In doing so, VERBUND avoids GHG emissions in its generation portfolio and contributes to achieving climate targets at the national and international level, alongside those of its customers and partners. By phasing out electricity and district heat generation from crude oil, hard coal and lignite, VERBUND has already made a significant contribution to decarbonisation. VERBUND also addresses climate change and its consequences. The scientific assessment of climate-related natural hazards and their impacts on VERBUND power plants means that actions can be adopted in good time. VERBUND’s goal is to continue to ensure safe power generation from renewable sources in Austria going forward. Climate change mitigation and climate adaptation are therefore important factors in achieving a sustainable and secure energy future. VERBUND focuses on actively shaping the energy system of the future. VERBUND promotes innovation as well as the development and use of new and environmentally friendly technologies and energy sources to meet challenges such as climate change and its ramifications. By engaging in climate change mitigation and adaptation VERBUND is setting the course for a sustainable and secure energy future. ESRS 2 General Disclosures Governance Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 GOV-3 – Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes The integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes is described in ESRS 2 GOV-3. Strategy Disclosure Requirement E1-1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation Through its past, current and future efforts in relation to climate change mitigation, VERBUND is ensuring that its strategy and business model are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with limiting global warming to 1.5°C in accordance with the Paris Agreement and with the European Union’s objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. With its corporate strategy, VERBUND aims to lead the transition to clean energy. VERBUND supports the European transition to clean energy through the expansion of renewable energy, especially wind and solar energy, achieving flexibility (pumped storage power plants, batteries) across countries as well as"
"232 building the European hydrogen economy through local production and by establishing European import routes. VERBUND continues to report transparently on its remaining activities relating to the transport, consumption and sale of natural gas, its use of fuels, and its targets for reducing this exposure to fossil fuels. In addition, VERBUND no longer uses fossil fuels such as crude oil, coal or lignite. As regards the transition plan for climate change mitigation, an approach was developed in line with Mission V and the strategic objectives, and an action plan containing targets and actions was adopted by VERBUND AG’s Executive Board. For details on GHG emissions reduction targets and pathways, see E1- 4 and the strategy and business model under ESRS 2 SBM-1. The progress made to date in the implementation of the transition plan is described in E1-6. VERBUND’s targets are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. VERBUND’s targets were reviewed as part of an external assessment performed by the ratings agency Moody’s. The results showed that the medium and long-term objectives are consistent with science-based general cross-sector pathways and sector-specific pathways for the main business activities aimed at limiting the temperature rise to 1.5°C. VERBUND is not exempt from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. The biggest decarbonisation levers for VERBUND’s own GHG emissions are the purchase of electricity from renewable generation for industrial customers, the medium to long-term phase-out of generation with natural gas through the use of hydrogen, and phasing out sales of natural gas to consumers. In the regulated area, the purchase of electricity produced from renewable energy for grid losses in the power grid and the installation of an additional electric compressor in the gas network were identified as decarbonisation levers. Building capacity for the generation of renewable energy and expanding the power grid are key indirect levers that impact decarbonisation in Europe in general. The specific GHG emissions reduction targets and information on VERBUND’s climate protection actions are listed under Disclosure Requirement E1-3 and E1-4. The transition plan is based on the corporate strategy and implemented as part of VERBUND’s ongoing business processes. The explanation and quantification of the investments and financial resources (CapEx, CapEx plan, OpEx) that support the plan, as well as revenue, are therefore consistent with the disclosures in the EU Taxonomy Disclosures section in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020/852) and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178. Potentially tied-in GHG emissions (or “locked-in” emissions) could become relevant for VERBUND in the future in connection with its thermal generation plant at the Mellach site, and the Gas Connect Austria gas network. The use of thermal power plants could be necessary to support the grid to a greater extent than currently envisaged to ensure security of supply in Austria in case of a crisis. In particular, this would result in higher than planned emission levels from the upstream direct Scope 1 and upstream Scope 3 GHG emissions due to natural gas requirements. This risk is mitigated through the expansion of renewable energy in Austria and also by the expansion of the Austrian transmission system based on regulatory requirements and national interests. The reduction pathways were developed based on planned use in normal circumstances and with a view to addition of green hydrogen or retrofitting plants for green hydrogen. In the Gas Connect Austria gas network, key GHG emitters include the compressor stations with either natural gas turbine compressors and/or electrically powered compressors installed.

"230 Environment VERBUND respects the right of present and future generations to an intact and habitable world. For this reason, VERBUND is working to prevent or reduce negative environmental impacts of its entrepreneurial activities, plants, products and services. VERBUND therefore contributes to achieving national and international environmental and climate targets and supports the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. VERBUND’s overarching voluntarily-defined environmental principles are enshrined in its publicly available environmental mission statement. The principles listed here are applicable as the basis for all material environmental topics identified from ESRS E1 to ESRS E5 in accordance with the materiality assessment. In addition, with its Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC), VERBUND requires its employees, suppliers and partners to uphold environmentally friendly practices, and it encourages the same from its customers. The Code of Conduct therefore encompasses policies related to the environmental topics of climate change, biodiversity and resource use. At Group level, a dedicated environmental guideline fosters a standardised framework for coordinating, implementing and improving environmental agendas within the VERBUND Group. It accordingly defines the principles and organisation of environmental agendas as well as the roles, responsibilities and tasks of the individuals involved in environmental matters. This ensures the integration of environmentally relevant rules and regulations, structures and processes into the existing organisational structure at all operational levels and the exchange of information regarding topics relevant to the environment. VERBUND’s two independent grid subsidiaries, Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH are not subject to the internal rules and regulations due to the unbundling regulations. Both independent companies implement environmental principles through their externally certified environmental management system. The general organisation of responsibilities is described in ESRS 2 GOV-1. The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) has also been established to address environmental matters. This Group-level committee, comprising the executive management of all subsidiaries and the divisional heads of the VERBUND holding company, is chaired by the Executive Board member responsible for environmental issues, and is concerned with relevant environmental topics. The Group Executive Board approves both the environmental mission statement, the Code of Conduct for sustainable corporate governance and Group-wide strategic environmental goals. The executive management of VERBUND subsidiaries is responsible for the operational implementation of external and internal environmental regulations, the Group’s environmental policy (the environmental mission statement) and the strategic environmental objectives as well as the environmental agendas for the respective company. The aforementioned implementation and externally certification of environmental management systems in accordance with ISO 14001 or the EMAS Regulation ensures that all mandatory commitments are met, environmental impacts documented, environmental data externally verified and targets and actions adopted to improve environmental performance at the companies. When planning, making decisions and taking action, VERBUND always takes the associated environmental impacts into account. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1."

This integrated planning was approved by the VERBUND AG’s Group Executive Board, and presented to the Supervisory Board’s Strategy and Sustainability Committee. Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 SBM-3 – Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model The following material impacts have been identified in relation to VERBUND’s business activities: VERBUND is contributing to the decarbonisation of the electricity system through its business model and strategic focus on the expansion of renewable energies. This makes it possible to reduce GHG emissions. On the other hand, VERBUND generates GHG emissions through the use of fossil fuels, thereby exacerbating climate change. Material impacts across the value chains result from procurement of goods, electricity sales and natural gas sales. Indirect GHG emissions are emitted across the upstream and downstream value chain, which exacerbates climate change. The following financially material risk drivers, which may be influenced positively and/or negatively by factors directly or indirectly related to climate change, have been identified: electricity price trends (depending on carbon prices, the generation energy mix, etc.), CapEx (depending on rising procurement prices, etc.), regulatory framework conditions, extreme weather events, the volatility of the generation volume and necessary technological adaptations. The impacts, risks and opportunities are taken into account in VERBUND’s strategy and business model. The three strategic focus areas of the VERBUND Strategy 2030 and Mission V strategy focus on a sustainable future in which electricity generation from renewable energy sources plays an even greater role.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 235 VERBUND deems it important to consider and prepare for future changes. A three-year project (CLIMPACT4VERBUND) was launched in 2024 to identify the impacts of climate change relevant to VERBUND. Various emission scenarios are taken into consideration, including a worst-case scenario as an extreme variant, and the latest climate models (CMIP6) applied. The project involves looking at expected changes in precipitation, wind, temperature and radiation for all of VERBUND’s sites in order to identify any future changes in energy generation and to be able to optimally plan future plants. In addition to the increase in heavy rainfall events, entailing a higher risk of flooding, and the change in the seasonality of the precipitation, the project also focuses on the increased probability of storms occurring, flooding, thunderstorms, hail events, mudslides and landslides, which could pose a physical climate change risk to VERBUND’s infrastructure. The project further involves a detailed analysis of the affected sites. As in the past, this will provide a basis for the forward-looking planning of necessary adaptations, such as the construction or upgrading of protective structures. The infrastructure of the Austrian Power Grid transmission system is also exposed to extreme weather conditions, affecting its operations and planning processes. At international level, in the future, long-term planning will be based on a climate model containing data from the Pan-European Climatic Database 4.0, which can map the warming of the earth’s surface in various stages. This allows for a more dynamic integration of climate change impacts into the planning processes of transmission system operators. Austrian Power Grid AG is also pursuing projects to prepare existing infrastructure and the planning of new projects for changing climatic conditions. The Climate Check project is a partnership between research institutes to explore and model future scenarios for various factors such as precipitation, temperature and wind. Other projects relate to research into lightning, forest fire prevention and accounting for the growing prevalence of animal species such as bark beetles. The results will be incorporated into the planning process for the existing network and for new construction projects in order to prepare the grid for the challenges presented by climate change. VERBUND ceased using lignite as fuel in 2006, oil in 2015 and hard coal in 2020, making it one of the pioneers of decarbonisation among Austria’s electric utilities. As a result, since 2005 VERBUND has continuously reduced its CO2 emissions from thermal power plants which fall under the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to the minimum level necessary to ensure security of supply in Austria. VERBUND ETS emissions amounted to 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 in 2024. This volume is 87% down on the 2005 figure (3.8 million tonnes of CO2), the year in which the EU ETS was launched. VERBUND is therefore contributing both to the avoidance and reduction of emissions, as well as to the actions described in SDG 13 “Climate action”. VERBUND has also massively reduced its airborne NOx emissions and reduce dust and SO2 emissions to zero, by reducing thermal generation volumes and switching to natural gas as a fuel. VERBUND consistently refers to the 2020 base year when reporting on future GHG reductions. In the period from 2020 to 2024, the Group achieved a reduction of around 19% in total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, excluding Category 2 (Capital goods). For details, see E1-4. The following table shows the key decarbonisation levers (> 50 kt CO2e) and a selection of related actions already implemented, currently in implementation or in planning. The GHG reductions expected as a result of the implementation were estimated relative to the base year of 2020. These refer to actions pending implementation or planned in connection with ongoing business processes, the implementation of which does not require significant additional monetary amounts from CapEx and OpEx. For Scope 3, additional reductions in GHG emissions are anticipated through the creation of a new Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) and the testing and implementation of further decarbonisation potential in the supply chain."

The results will be incorporated into the planning process for the existing network and for new construction projects in order to prepare the grid for the challenges presented by climate change. VERBUND ceased using lignite as fuel in 2006, oil in 2015 and hard coal in 2020, making it one of the pioneers of decarbonisation among Austria’s electric utilities. As a result, since 2005 VERBUND has continuously reduced its CO2 emissions from thermal power plants which fall under the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to the minimum level necessary to ensure security of supply in Austria. VERBUND ETS emissions amounted to 0.5 million tonnes of CO2 in 2024. This volume is 87% down on the 2005 figure (3.8 million tonnes of CO2), the year in which the EU ETS was launched. VERBUND is therefore contributing both to the avoidance and reduction of emissions, as well as to the actions described in SDG 13 “Climate action”. VERBUND has also massively reduced its airborne NOx emissions and reduce dust and SO2 emissions to zero, by reducing thermal generation volumes and switching to natural gas as a fuel. VERBUND consistently refers to the 2020 base year when reporting on future GHG reductions. In the period from 2020 to 2024, the Group achieved a reduction of around 19% in total Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, excluding Category 2 (Capital goods). For details, see E1-4. The following table shows the key decarbonisation levers (> 50 kt CO2e) and a selection of related actions already implemented, currently in implementation or in planning. The GHG reductions expected as a result of the implementation were estimated relative to the base year of 2020. These refer to actions pending implementation or planned in connection with ongoing business processes, the implementation of which does not require significant additional monetary amounts from CapEx and OpEx. For Scope 3, additional reductions in GHG emissions are anticipated through the creation of a new Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) and the testing and implementation of further decarbonisation potential in the supply chain."

With the phasing out of thermal electricity generation reliant on lignite, hard coal, and heating oil, VERBUND has already succeeded in massively reducing its GHG emissions, thereby minimising the impact of its climate change contribution through direct GHG emissions. VERBUND now operates only one state-of-the-art combined cycle gas power plant in Mellach near Graz as well as one back-up power plant, which is also powered by natural gas. These two power plants are necessary for the security of supply in Austria. Due to VERBUND’s equity interest in the gas transport network of Gas Connect Austria, GHG emissions include emissions from the transport of natural gas. VERBUND’s targets related to climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation are based on its strategic defined targets set forth in its corporate strategy. VERBUND seeks to further reduce its contribution to impacting climate change and has set itself ambitious GHG reduction targets in this regard. In the update, 2020 was defined as the base year and the targets were fleshed out. In the period from 2020 to 2024, the Group was able to achieve a reduction of around 19% in total Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, excluding Category 2 (Capital goods). Using the base year 2020 makes it possible to partially present the reduction effects in terms of thermal generation at VERBUND resulting from the phase-out of electricity generation reliant on hard coal. The base year 2020 was also the first year in which the data for Scope 3 emissions was available in the scope of the Corporate Carbon Footprint prepared in 2021. The base year was recalculated to ensure that it was representative and covered all activities. For more information, see the paragraph on “significant changes and their impacts on GHG emissions”. These targets were approved and published by the Group Executive Board. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1. GHG reduction targets for 2030: VERBUND is committed to reducing absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, excluding Category 2, by 74% between 2020 and 2030.

GHG reduction goal 2050 – net zero: VERBUND is committed to achieving net zero GHG emissions from 2050 onwards (a reduction of at least 90% of greenhouse gas emissions and the elimination of residual emissions) starting in 2020 as the base year with the exclusion of GHG emissions generated by capital goods in order to achieve decarbonisation of the energy system (expansion of renewable energy). The aim is to reduce GHG emissions to an unavoidable minimum level and to use recognised actions to neutralise a maximum of 10% of residual emissions. Indirect GHG emissions in Category 2 are attributable at VERBUND to upstream GHG emissions from capital goods with the aim of decarbonising the energy system. These GHG emissions are reported transparently, but are excluded from the scope of the target, as the capital goods in question are aimed at increasing and diversifying renewable generation capacities, and expanding and modernising the electricity grid (for more information, see the Taxonomy Regulation disclosures in the EU taxonomy section). Therefore, these targets are not consistent with the boundaries of the GHG inventory. These investments make an important contribution to the transition to clean energy, and are not linked to locked-in emissions. Capital expenditure invested in grid expansion also facilitates the integration of new wind farms and photovoltaic installations. The VERBUND 2030 strategy provides for an expansion of renewable generation assets, grids and storage, which will lead to an increase in both the renewables generation capacity and in indirect GHG emissions in Category 2 (Capital goods) in the years these generation assets are brought into operation. Reducing this emissions category is not compatible with VERBUND’s strategy of expanding the renewable energy sector. The expansion of renewable energies contributes to reducing VERBUND’s GHG emissions and those of many other companies and countries. Sector coupling allows electricity generated from renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels in the thermal energy and transport sectors. Targets and actions aimed at expanding renewable energies, increasing energy efficiency and achieving the technological and geographical diversification of generation facilities are defined in order to manage further climate-related risks and opportunities. The levers for reducing GHG emissions by 2030 include reducing the use of fossil fuels, purchasing electricity from renewable energy for grid losses (where approved by the regulator) and distributing electricity from renewables generation to industrial customers. Scope 1 accounts for 4%, Scope 2 for 6%, and Scope 3 for 90% of the total contributions to the target achievement of 74% (see also “GHG emissions table” under E1-6). In terms of net zero, the target for 2050 defined by VERBUND’s Executive Board is to achieve a reduction of at least 90% and remove residual emissions. The contributions to reducing Scope 1 emissions are mainly achieved by replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen, for Scope 2 by purchasing electricity from renewable energy for all energy consumption, and for Scope 3 through further reductions in the supply chain. In the 2020 base year, a total of 6,258 kt CO2e was calculated for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as well as Scope 3 emissions. These emissions are used to calculate the reduction targets with the exclusion of Category 2, with 6,242 kt CO2e thereby serving as the basis for defining the target. The targets for the emissions intensity of electricity generation and electricity sales are based on the absolute targets. The intensity target for electricity generation refers to the ratio of Scope 1 emissions from the electricity generation and electricity transport sector to total generation. The Scope 3 intensity target is determined on the basis of the ratio of Scope 3 emissions from the sale of purchased electricity to the total sales of electricity to consumers.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 239 with the primary activities of the integrated energy supplier, namely the generation of electricity for Scope 1 and the sale of electricity to consumers for Scope 3, along with the associated activities. Overall, the share of emissions encompassed here came to around 80% of GHG emissions in the 2020 base year. As a result, the intensity targets cover the majority of Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Further intensity values can only be meaningfully presented with different relative figures for the respective business activities and are not currently planned. In 2020, the Scope 1 emissions intensity of VERBUND’s generation was already well below the reduction pathway for the 1.5-degree scenario. VERBUND’s objective of reducing the GHG emissions intensity of direct emissions from its own generation by 40% between 2020 and 2030, from 20 g CO2e/kWh of total net generation to 12 g CO2e/kWh, is based on a sector-specific 1.5-degree pathway for electricity and gas suppliers. The sector-specific decarbonisation pathway was derived from the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net zero emissions scenario by 2050. In 2024, VERBUND’s specific Scope 1 emissions came to 13 g CO2e/kWh. Further decarbonisation of VERBUND’s generation using natural gas at the combined cycle gas turbine plant in Mellach is not possible in the period up to 2030. This would require replacing natural gas with a low or zero carbon fuel. Green hydrogen would be one way to further reduce these emissions, and tests are already underway. The Mellach site is particularly important for maintaining security of supply in Austria in terms of congestion management, and as a back-up site. VERBUND’s objective of reducing the emission intensity of the electricity purchased for resale by 90% from 324 g CO2e/kWh to 28 g CO2e/kWh between 2020 and 2030 is also in line with the sector-specific decarbonisation pathway, and therefore also with the 1.5 degree target for electricity and gas suppliers based on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) target of net zero emissions by 2050. The majority of Scope 3 emissions – currently over 80% – come from electricity procurement for industrial customers, i.e. the electricity that VERBUND purchases to supply its consumers on the international market, which comprises a mix of various generation technologies or is based on renewable energy, depending on customers’ wishes. The electricity for household customers is sourced entirely from renewable energies. In the future, VERBUND plans to strategically reposition its sales to industrial customers and to gradually shift to unbundled guarantees of origin for electricity from renewable energy sources, or to bundled purchases of renewable electricity and guarantees of origin. The VERBUND GHG emissions reduction targets were derived from a combination of general and sector-specific pathways developed on a scientific basis by the International Energy Agency. Recommendations from the Science Based Targets initiative for electricity utilities were also incorporated. Reference was made to the guidelines for the external assessment performed by the rating agency, Moody’s, in determining compatibility with the 1.5 degree target, and an external review was conducted by this agency. According to this assessment, the targets are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The determination of GHG emissions reduction targets takes into account future developments in strategically relevant areas with regard to capacity and generation on the basis of internal energy modelling as well as analysing changes in demand behaviour among customers. In addition, European strategies, rules and regulations, and targets, both current and those anticipated to be adopted in the near future, were considered when developing the targets. The retrofitting of plants and the use of green hydrogen was factored into target pathways beyond 2030 with a current assessment of target performance."
"240 Planning in terms of the energy market will continue to closely follow future developments, as relevant changes can have both negative and positive impacts on the reduction targets. The emissions targets were compared with sector-specific decarbonisation pathways derived from International Energy Agency (IEA) scenarios. The most ambitious pathway taken into consideration aims to achieve net zero emissions worldwide by 2050 and to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5°C. Based on the emissions reported and the targets set, VERBUND’s GHG emissions were compared against the emission estimates for the target year taken from three trajectories (IEA scenarios: Net Zero Emissions by 2050, Announced Pledges Scenario and Stated Policies Scenario). For VERBUND’s intensity targets in Scope 1 (electricity generated) and Scope 3, Category 3 for electricity purchased for resale to consumers, the global pathway for electricity and gas suppliers was applied, which refers to the carbon intensity of generation in grammes of CO2e/kWh. The absolute targets for all scopes of GHG emissions (excluding Category 2, capital goods) were defined using sector- independent, general global benchmarks that reflect the broad diversity of emissions. Disclosure Requirement E1-5 – Energy consumption and energy mix VERBUND uses fossil fuels as an energy source. In 2024, only the fossil fuel natural gas was used for thermal generation to produce electricity and district heating. Neither hard coal nor sewage sludge (biomass as a substitute fuel) has been used since 2021. Natural gas is also used in the gas compressor stations to operate the Gas Connect Austria gas grid. Fuels are used in the vehicle fleet and for equipment. As an electric utility, VERBUND AG operates in Sector D “Electricity, natural gas, steam and cooling supply”, one of the sectors with high climate impacts. It is therefore necessary to perform a further breakdown of the energy consumption from fossil fuels. VERBUND’s internal electricity consumption consists of electricity from various sources and comprises grid procurement for administrative facilities, power plants, pumping and turbining, as well as grid systems along with self-generated electricity by VERBUND’s own generation plants. The largest volumes of electricity are sourced for hydropower plants for pumping and turbining and to compensate for grid losses in the Austrian Power Grid electricity transmission network. Energy consumption in fully consolidated companies and entities with operational control is reported in line with Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. The disclosures comprise the total energy consumption in MWh within the Group’s own operations, and are broken down in the following table."
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 243 GHG emissions are separately quantified for carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O, nitrogen trifluoride NF3, sulphur hexafluoride SF6 and other GHGs (HFCs, PFCs, NF3, etc.). All ETS emissions are recorded directly in CO2e on the basis of information provided by the respective plant owner (due to the time period limited to January for preparing the report based on preliminary values prior to the annual ETS audit). The uncertainty of the disclosures is already very low by this time. Emissions from the ETS plants are verified with sufficient certainty once a year by an external independent test facility by the end of March. The auditors enter these values in the national emissions trading registry. The indirect GHG emissions for Scope 2 “Imported energy”, i.e. electricity and thermal energy purchased from the grid and consumed internally by the Group, are calculated using carbon emission factors and expressed as CO2e. GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC, SF6 and NF3) are considered by IPCC based on their GWP. The other indirect emissions are included under Scope 3. Factors taken from the DEFRA database, the Austrian Federal Environment Agency, and from ecoinvent were used in the calculations. Scope 3 GHG emissions were largely estimated using inputs from the upstream and downstream value chain associated with these standard emission factors. No emissions are calculated using primary data from suppliers. The DEFRA database version “v12” was used for 2023 and “v13” for 2024. The ecoinvent emission factors are converted each year to the latest available version of ecoinvent. In 2023, this was version 3.8.0 (2021) and in 2024 version 3.10, which is linked to IPCC AR6 and the Global Warming Potential GWP (100 years). However, the database updates did not match the most recent version of the emission factors that had been documented. The analysis revealed changes in the range of approximately 5%. To reduce uncertainty among the selected emission factors, the available emission factors are compared with alternative sources. Whenever necessary corrections are identified, these are implemented and documented in the calculations, and the results of any recalculations are published. In accordance with the best-effort approach, VERBUND will in future endeavour to supplement these calculations with disclosures from suppliers – see also ESRS 2 BP-2. GWP rates from IPCC Until now, use has been made of the Global Warming Potential GWP (100 years) as defined by IPCC AR5. For 2024, the emission factors were updated in accordance with IPCC AR6 Global Warming Potential GWP (100 years)."

The GHG intensity in 2024 was therefore significantly below the specific figure for direct CO2 emissions from the Austrian generation mix in 2023 according to the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB), at 96 g CO2/kWh. VERBUND is therefore even lower than the figure for the European generation mix, i.e. 219 g CO2/kWh in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), but approximately 20% of this came from the generation of nuclear energy, whereas VERBUND achieves its specific emission value entirely without any generation using nuclear energy. These comparisons show how successful VERBUND has been in its drive to achieve nuclear-free decarbonisation of its electricity generation. VERBUND’s strategic focus envisages a further increase in the volume generated using renewable energy. This will further improve the aforementioned figure.

Gross Scope 2 GHG emissions Indirect Scope 2 GHG emissions originate from grid losses, from electricity consumption (grid purchases) and from the purchase of district heating and cooling. Two different figures are reported for these emissions: a location-based figure and a market-based figure. Corresponding upstream emissions are accounted for in Scope 3 in accordance with the life cycle assessment. The location-based figure is calculated using the carbon emission factor for the local power grid. Therefore, this figure will only change if there are modifications in the quantities of electricity purchased and/or changes in the national or European generation landscape. In the 2024 reporting period, the"
"246 emissions factor of Austria’s power grid declined. Electricity consumption for the operation of hydropower plants in pumping/turbining mode fell, whereas it increased for grid losses in the power grid. The market-based figure can be reduced for unregulated business activities through strategic procurement of electricity generated from sources with lower emissions per kWh purchased. For several years now, VERBUND has exclusively used electricity with guarantees of origin from 100% renewable energy (unbundled) to operate pumped storage power plants, which has helped it to substantially reduce its market-based emissions. Smaller quantities are procured partly bundled and partly unbundled. The European electricity mix of fossil, nuclear and renewable generation is currently being used for grid loss energy purchases in the Austrian power grid. For regulatory reasons, the targeted procurement of electricity from renewables is not yet possible, but this is being sought by 2030. Information on the source of the purchased electricity was used to calculate the market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions. In 2024, 64% of electricity volumes were sourced using contractual instruments (power purchase agreements, evidence of cancellation of guarantees of origin) with unbundled guarantees of origin.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 247 The Scope 3 categories that are significant to VERBUND’s GHG balance were analysed as significant according to the criteria: Category 1 (Purchased goods and services), Category 2 (Capital goods), Category 3 (Fuel and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or 2), Category 6 (Business travel), Category 11 (Use of sold products) and Category 15 (Investments, i.e. equity interests) for VERBUND. The analysis was based on the previously conducted Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) calculations in the Sustainability Data Management Tool, the consideration of new business activities and an assessment using ecoinvent factors. Category 6 is included despite its very low share of Scope 3 emissions as it was deemed significant for employee engagement. In the downstream value chain, VERBUND’s equity interests were analysed based on ESRS requirements. Not previously included until 2023, Scope 3 Category 15 was therefore included in the CCF. To ensure comparability between the current and the previous reporting periods, the GHG emissions of equity interests were also added for the 2020 base year, and reported for the previous year 2023. Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 15 were included in VERBUND’s GHG emissions inventory. All GHG emission factors are recorded in the Sustainability Data Management Tool. They are continuously updated and adjusted in line with the latest findings and requirements. This methodology ensures that GHG emissions inventories are mapped consistently and in a comparative manner. Emission factors specific to VERBUND are calculated for upstream and downstream GHG emissions based on the currently available version of the ecoinvent database, and taking into account all types of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC. GHG emissions emitted are measured in CO2 equivalents (CO2e), taking into account national, regional and company-specific emission factors. In Scope 3, fully consolidated as well as non-consolidated companies under the operational control of VERBUND are documented similarly to Scope 1 and 2. See also paragraph Methods, key assumptions and emission factors.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 243 GHG emissions are separately quantified for carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O, nitrogen trifluoride NF3, sulphur hexafluoride SF6 and other GHGs (HFCs, PFCs, NF3, etc.). All ETS emissions are recorded directly in CO2e on the basis of information provided by the respective plant owner (due to the time period limited to January for preparing the report based on preliminary values prior to the annual ETS audit). The uncertainty of the disclosures is already very low by this time. Emissions from the ETS plants are verified with sufficient certainty once a year by an external independent test facility by the end of March. The auditors enter these values in the national emissions trading registry. The indirect GHG emissions for Scope 2 “Imported energy”, i.e. electricity and thermal energy purchased from the grid and consumed internally by the Group, are calculated using carbon emission factors and expressed as CO2e. GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC, SF6 and NF3) are considered by IPCC based on their GWP. The other indirect emissions are included under Scope 3. Factors taken from the DEFRA database, the Austrian Federal Environment Agency, and from ecoinvent were used in the calculations. Scope 3 GHG emissions were largely estimated using inputs from the upstream and downstream value chain associated with these standard emission factors. No emissions are calculated using primary data from suppliers. The DEFRA database version “v12” was used for 2023 and “v13” for 2024. The ecoinvent emission factors are converted each year to the latest available version of ecoinvent. In 2023, this was version 3.8.0 (2021) and in 2024 version 3.10, which is linked to IPCC AR6 and the Global Warming Potential GWP (100 years). However, the database updates did not match the most recent version of the emission factors that had been documented. The analysis revealed changes in the range of approximately 5%. To reduce uncertainty among the selected emission factors, the available emission factors are compared with alternative sources. Whenever necessary corrections are identified, these are implemented and documented in the calculations, and the results of any recalculations are published. In accordance with the best-effort approach, VERBUND will in future endeavour to supplement these calculations with disclosures from suppliers – see also ESRS 2 BP-2. GWP rates from IPCC Until now, use has been made of the Global Warming Potential GWP (100 years) as defined by IPCC AR5. For 2024, the emission factors were updated in accordance with IPCC AR6 Global Warming Potential GWP (100 years)."

The GHG intensity in 2024 was therefore significantly below the specific figure for direct CO2 emissions from the Austrian generation mix in 2023 according to the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB), at 96 g CO2/kWh. VERBUND is therefore even lower than the figure for the European generation mix, i.e. 219 g CO2/kWh in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), but approximately 20% of this came from the generation of nuclear energy, whereas VERBUND achieves its specific emission value entirely without any generation using nuclear energy. These comparisons show how successful VERBUND has been in its drive to achieve nuclear-free decarbonisation of its electricity generation.

"248 occur between the reporting dates of entities in its value chain, and the date of the undertaking's financial statements for general purposes, a corresponding disclosure will be published in the next annual report. Significant changes and their impacts on GHG emissions There were several significant changes that made it necessary to recalculate the 2020 base year of the CCF based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. These changes are designed to permit better future control over target achievement in relation to GHG emissions. Recalculations of the CCF are performed and documented in the event of material changes or errors. Regardless of whether they cause the values to rise or fall, they are considered material if they account for more than 5% of the relevant scope in the base year or reporting year. The acquisition of the gas network operator Gas Connect Austria was taken into account in the base year in accordance with the requirements of the GHG Protocol, producing a 13% increase in Scope 1 emissions in 2020. The electricity consumption of Gas Connect Austria for Scope 2 market-based emissions was recalculated, GHG emissions from the grid purchases of power plants were reallocated on the basis of CSRD requirements, and the emission factor for the unknown electricity mix was changed to reflect the EU mix. In total, market-based Scope 2 emissions rose by 11% in 2020. Notably, the target for Scope 3 emissions produced by electricity sales to consumers required a transition from the location- based approach to the market-based approach in order to allow the figure to be controlled through the active and successive transition to renewable energy among industrial customers. This led to an increase in emissions Category 3 in 2020. The inclusion of Category 15 Investments in accordance with the requirements of ESRS standards and their significance, led to a further increase in Scope 3 emissions. In total, Scope 3 emissions then rose by 21% in 2020. All changes in the GHG emissions calculation, such as the inclusion of non-consolidated companies, the transition to a market-based approach for electricity sales to consumers and the inclusion of investments, were taken into account in all Scopes in 2023.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 247 The Scope 3 categories that are significant to VERBUND’s GHG balance were analysed as significant according to the criteria: Category 1 (Purchased goods and services), Category 2 (Capital goods), Category 3 (Fuel and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or 2), Category 6 (Business travel), Category 11 (Use of sold products) and Category 15 (Investments, i.e. equity interests) for VERBUND. The analysis was based on the previously conducted Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) calculations in the Sustainability Data Management Tool, the consideration of new business activities and an assessment using ecoinvent factors. Category 6 is included despite its very low share of Scope 3 emissions as it was deemed significant for employee engagement. In the downstream value chain, VERBUND’s equity interests were analysed based on ESRS requirements. Not previously included until 2023, Scope 3 Category 15 was therefore included in the CCF. To ensure comparability between the current and the previous reporting periods, the GHG emissions of equity interests were also added for the 2020 base year, and reported for the previous year 2023. Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 15 were included in VERBUND’s GHG emissions inventory. All GHG emission factors are recorded in the Sustainability Data Management Tool. They are continuously updated and adjusted in line with the latest findings and requirements. This methodology ensures that GHG emissions inventories are mapped consistently and in a comparative manner. Emission factors specific to VERBUND are calculated for upstream and downstream GHG emissions based on the currently available version of the ecoinvent database, and taking into account all types of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC. GHG emissions emitted are measured in CO2 equivalents (CO2e), taking into account national, regional and company-specific emission factors. In Scope 3, fully consolidated as well as non-consolidated companies under the operational control of VERBUND are documented similarly to Scope 1 and 2.

Significant changes and their impacts on GHG emissions There were several significant changes that made it necessary to recalculate the 2020 base year of the CCF based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. These changes are designed to permit better future control over target achievement in relation to GHG emissions. Recalculations of the CCF are performed and documented in the event of material changes or errors. Regardless of whether they cause the values to rise or fall, they are considered material if they account for more than 5% of the relevant scope in the base year or reporting year. The acquisition of the gas network operator Gas Connect Austria was taken into account in the base year in accordance with the requirements of the GHG Protocol, producing a 13% increase in Scope 1 emissions in 2020. The electricity consumption of Gas Connect Austria for Scope 2 market-based emissions was recalculated, GHG emissions from the grid purchases of power plants were reallocated on the basis of CSRD requirements, and the emission factor for the unknown electricity mix was changed to reflect the EU mix. In total, market-based Scope 2 emissions rose by 11% in 2020. Notably, the target for Scope 3 emissions produced by electricity sales to consumers required a transition from the location- based approach to the market-based approach in order to allow the figure to be controlled through the active and successive transition to renewable energy among industrial customers. This led to an increase in emissions Category 3 in 2020. The inclusion of Category 15 Investments in accordance with the requirements of ESRS standards and their significance, led to a further increase in Scope 3 emissions. In total, Scope 3 emissions then rose by 21% in 2020. All changes in the GHG emissions calculation, such as the inclusion of non-consolidated companies, the transition to a market-based approach for electricity sales to consumers and the inclusion of investments, were taken into account in all Scopes in 2023. This produced a 0% change in Scope 1 emissions, a 4% increase in Scope 2 location-based emissions, and a 6% decrease in Scope 2 market- based emissions, with Scope 3 emissions falling by 1%.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 249 Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing As an energy supplier and electricity producer, carbon pricing is a key cost factor for VERBUND that needs to be included in corporate decisions at every level. The VERBUND business strategy is based on modelled future business scenarios. Carbon pricing is one of the metrics used to develop these scenarios, which include energy market performance in Europe and impacts on VERBUND power plants. Carbon prices also play a key role in assessing future generation technologies and investment decisions. Given that carbon prices are expected to rise substantially over the coming years, the incentive to reduce GHG emissions while increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable energies, and investing in the development of low-carbon technologies will grow. This is in line with VERBUND’s strategic projects and supports the achievement of climate-related goals. The internal carbon price forms part of the assumptions applicable to the internal VERBUND Energy Market Model (VEMM). The results of the VEMM are used for budget planning, investment decisions and impairment testing VERBUND’s power plants. The incorporated internal carbon price is based on the EU ETS price and forms part of VERBUND’s planning assumptions. These planning assumptions must be applied by all parts of VERBUND, both when making investment decisions and reviewing existing plants. As all of the Group’s divisions are located in EU member states, the internal carbon price is applied throughout the Group. Around 479,000 tonnes, or 96% of VERBUND’s Scope 1 emissions, are measured using the internal carbon price. Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions are not included in the internal carbon pricing. All current applications use the carbon price, which corresponds to the current prices listed on the stock exchange (ICE, EEX). The long-term performance of the carbon price is based on assumptions made by international consulting firms. An average price from all available external scenarios is used as the base scenario for determining the long-term performance of carbon prices. Price forecasts are used to measure the value in use, determine fair values and ascertain the impairment of assets. More details are available in the consolidated financial statements. The prices applied in 2024 were in the region of €67/t CO2e. VERBUND expects carbon prices to rise sharply in the long term.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 247 The Scope 3 categories that are significant to VERBUND’s GHG balance were analysed as significant according to the criteria: Category 1 (Purchased goods and services), Category 2 (Capital goods), Category 3 (Fuel and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or 2), Category 6 (Business travel), Category 11 (Use of sold products) and Category 15 (Investments, i.e. equity interests) for VERBUND. The analysis was based on the previously conducted Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) calculations in the Sustainability Data Management Tool, the consideration of new business activities and an assessment using ecoinvent factors. Category 6 is included despite its very low share of Scope 3 emissions as it was deemed significant for employee engagement. In the downstream value chain, VERBUND’s equity interests were analysed based on ESRS requirements. Not previously included until 2023, Scope 3 Category 15 was therefore included in the CCF. To ensure comparability between the current and the previous reporting periods, the GHG emissions of equity interests were also added for the 2020 base year, and reported for the previous year 2023. Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 15 were included in VERBUND’s GHG emissions inventory. All GHG emission factors are recorded in the Sustainability Data Management Tool. They are continuously updated and adjusted in line with the latest findings and requirements. This methodology ensures that GHG emissions inventories are mapped consistently and in a comparative manner. Emission factors specific to VERBUND are calculated for upstream and downstream GHG emissions based on the currently available version of the ecoinvent database, and taking into account all types of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC. GHG emissions emitted are measured in CO2 equivalents (CO2e), taking into account national, regional and company-specific emission factors.

Significant changes and their impacts on GHG emissions There were several significant changes that made it necessary to recalculate the 2020 base year of the CCF based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. These changes are designed to permit better future control over target achievement in relation to GHG emissions. Recalculations of the CCF are performed and documented in the event of material changes or errors. Regardless of whether they cause the values to rise or fall, they are considered material if they account for more than 5% of the relevant scope in the base year or reporting year. The acquisition of the gas network operator Gas Connect Austria was taken into account in the base year in accordance with the requirements of the GHG Protocol, producing a 13% increase in Scope 1 emissions in 2020. The electricity consumption of Gas Connect Austria for Scope 2 market-based emissions was recalculated, GHG emissions from the grid purchases of power plants were reallocated on the basis of CSRD requirements, and the emission factor for the unknown electricity mix was changed to reflect the EU mix. In total, market-based Scope 2 emissions rose by 11% in 2020. Notably, the target for Scope 3 emissions produced by electricity sales to consumers required a transition from the location- based approach to the market-based approach in order to allow the figure to be controlled through the active and successive transition to renewable energy among industrial customers. This led to an increase in emissions Category 3 in 2020. The inclusion of Category 15 Investments in accordance with the requirements of ESRS standards and their significance, led to a further increase in Scope 3 emissions. In total, Scope 3 emissions then rose by 21% in 2020. All changes in the GHG emissions calculation, such as the inclusion of non-consolidated companies, the transition to a market-based approach for electricity sales to consumers and the inclusion of investments, were taken into account in all Scopes in 2023.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 249 Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing As an energy supplier and electricity producer, carbon pricing is a key cost factor for VERBUND that needs to be included in corporate decisions at every level. The VERBUND business strategy is based on modelled future business scenarios. Carbon pricing is one of the metrics used to develop these scenarios, which include energy market performance in Europe and impacts on VERBUND power plants. Carbon prices also play a key role in assessing future generation technologies and investment decisions. Given that carbon prices are expected to rise substantially over the coming years, the incentive to reduce GHG emissions while increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable energies, and investing in the development of low-carbon technologies will grow. This is in line with VERBUND’s strategic projects and supports the achievement of climate-related goals. The internal carbon price forms part of the assumptions applicable to the internal VERBUND Energy Market Model (VEMM). The results of the VEMM are used for budget planning, investment decisions and impairment testing VERBUND’s power plants. The incorporated internal carbon price is based on the EU ETS price and forms part of VERBUND’s planning assumptions. These planning assumptions must be applied by all parts of VERBUND, both when making investment decisions and reviewing existing plants. As all of the Group’s divisions are located in EU member states, the internal carbon price is applied throughout the Group. Around 479,000 tonnes, or 96% of VERBUND’s Scope 1 emissions, are measured using the internal carbon price. Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions are not included in the internal carbon pricing. All current applications use the carbon price, which corresponds to the current prices listed on the stock exchange (ICE, EEX). The long-term performance of the carbon price is based on assumptions made by international consulting firms. An average price from all available external scenarios is used as the base scenario for determining the long-term performance of carbon prices. Price forecasts are used to measure the value in use, determine fair values and ascertain the impairment of assets. More details are available in the consolidated financial statements. The prices applied in 2024 were in the region of €67/t CO2e. VERBUND expects carbon prices to rise sharply in the long term.

Electricity consumption for the operation of hydropower plants in pumping/turbining mode fell, whereas it increased for grid losses in the power grid. The market-based figure can be reduced for unregulated business activities through strategic procurement of electricity generated from sources with lower emissions per kWh purchased. For several years now, VERBUND has exclusively used electricity with guarantees of origin from 100% renewable energy (unbundled) to operate pumped storage power plants, which has helped it to substantially reduce its market-based emissions. Smaller quantities are procured partly bundled and partly unbundled. The European electricity mix of fossil, nuclear and renewable generation is currently being used for grid loss energy purchases in the Austrian power grid. For regulatory reasons, the targeted procurement of electricity from renewables is not yet possible, but this is being sought by 2030. Information on the source of the purchased electricity was used to calculate the market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions. In 2024, 64% of electricity volumes were sourced using contractual instruments (power purchase agreements, evidence of cancellation of guarantees of origin) with unbundled guarantees of origin.

"250 Disclosure Requirement E2-1 – Policies related to pollution It is crucial for VERBUND to manage material negative impacts in order to avoid and mitigate air pollution. In addition to ensuring compliance with regulatory obligations, VERBUND’s policies also focus on incidents and emergency situations with regard to air pollution. The policies at subsidiary level contain specifications regarding emissions into the air. VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH also has its own environmental policy. The thermal generation plants in Mellach are validated in accordance with the EMAS regulation in addition to ISO 14001. This means that an environmental statement in accordance with the EMAS III Regulation has been issued exclusively for the Mellach power plants site. At Gas Connect Austria GmbH, an integrated management system that meets the requirements of an environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 is externally certified on an annual basis. Air pollutants, among other things, are reported in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (in the future industrial emissions portal) for the Mellach power plants site and for Gas Connect Austria GmbH in accordance with the E-PRTR regulation. The management systems in place at VERBUND ensure that improvement processes are continuously pursued while simultaneously defining areas of application, roles, responsibilities, accounting for context and stakeholder interests, and establishing the assessment of risks and opportunities. Accordingly, the topic of air pollution is continuously addressed and corresponding targets, actions, and a monitoring process are derived on this basis. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1. Disclosure Requirement E2-2 – Actions and resources related to pollution VERBUND continuously introduces actions to avoid and mitigate air pollution, and allocates appropriate funds for this purpose. Notably, these are not one-off measures but instead recurring measures that are implemented as part of ongoing business processes for which it is not possible to make any estimates with regard to financial figures. As part of the implemented management systems, either an environmental programme (in accordance with ISO 14001/EMAS at VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH) or a plan of action (in accordance with ISO 14001/IMS at Gas Connect Austria) is continuously updated and implemented. This also includes the appropriate planning of resources. Technical actions have already substantially reduced emissions that contribute to pollution. The phasing out of hard coal in the generation of electricity and district heating has eliminated SO2 and dust emissions. Furthermore, the transition to hydrogen should prevent future airborne emissions. At the Mellach power plants site, flue gas purification equipment minimises emissions of environmentally harmful substances into the air. As this is already the best available technology, there are currently no improvement options or key actions planned until new technologies become available. Research projects are carried out on an ongoing basis to gain new insights and deepen the understanding on existing issues. To avoid and mitigate potential impacts on people and the natural environment in the event of emergencies and incidents, there are appropriate emergency and crisis plans available for companies and sites. These plans also take into account the risk of air pollution that may occur in the event of incidents. In 2023, additional official environmental inspections along with in-depth reviews pursuant to the Industrial Accident Ordinance were carried out and passed in Mellach. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulation on the Protection of Workers from Explosive Atmospheres (Verordnung explosionsfähige Atmosphären, VEXAT), Gas Connect Austria gas plants are categorised into defined potentially explosive areas, so-called “Ex zones”, and process areas with regard to explosion protection,"

Carbon pricing is one of the metrics used to develop these scenarios, which include energy market performance in Europe and impacts on VERBUND power plants. Carbon prices also play a key role in assessing future generation technologies and investment decisions. Given that carbon prices are expected to rise substantially over the coming years, the incentive to reduce GHG emissions while increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable energies, and investing in the development of low-carbon technologies will grow. This is in line with VERBUND’s strategic projects and supports the achievement of climate-related goals. The internal carbon price forms part of the assumptions applicable to the internal VERBUND Energy Market Model (VEMM). The results of the VEMM are used for budget planning, investment decisions and impairment testing VERBUND’s power plants. The incorporated internal carbon price is based on the EU ETS price and forms part of VERBUND’s planning assumptions. These planning assumptions must be applied by all parts of VERBUND, both when making investment decisions and reviewing existing plants. As all of the Group’s divisions are located in EU member states, the internal carbon price is applied throughout the Group. Around 479,000 tonnes, or 96% of VERBUND’s Scope 1 emissions, are measured using the internal carbon price. Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions are not included in the internal carbon pricing. All current applications use the carbon price, which corresponds to the current prices listed on the stock exchange (ICE, EEX). The long-term performance of the carbon price is based on assumptions made by international consulting firms. An average price from all available external scenarios is used as the base scenario for determining the long-term performance of carbon prices. Price forecasts are used to measure the value in use, determine fair values and ascertain the impairment of assets. More details are available in the consolidated financial statements. The prices applied in 2024 were in the region of €67/t CO2e. VERBUND expects carbon prices to rise sharply in the long term.

"250 Disclosure Requirement E2-1 – Policies related to pollution It is crucial for VERBUND to manage material negative impacts in order to avoid and mitigate air pollution. In addition to ensuring compliance with regulatory obligations, VERBUND’s policies also focus on incidents and emergency situations with regard to air pollution. The policies at subsidiary level contain specifications regarding emissions into the air. VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH also has its own environmental policy. The thermal generation plants in Mellach are validated in accordance with the EMAS regulation in addition to ISO 14001. This means that an environmental statement in accordance with the EMAS III Regulation has been issued exclusively for the Mellach power plants site. At Gas Connect Austria GmbH, an integrated management system that meets the requirements of an environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 is externally certified on an annual basis. Air pollutants, among other things, are reported in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (in the future industrial emissions portal) for the Mellach power plants site and for Gas Connect Austria GmbH in accordance with the E-PRTR regulation. The management systems in place at VERBUND ensure that improvement processes are continuously pursued while simultaneously defining areas of application, roles, responsibilities, accounting for context and stakeholder interests, and establishing the assessment of risks and opportunities. Accordingly, the topic of air pollution is continuously addressed and corresponding targets, actions, and a monitoring process are derived on this basis. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1. Disclosure Requirement E2-2 – Actions and resources related to pollution VERBUND continuously introduces actions to avoid and mitigate air pollution, and allocates appropriate funds for this purpose. Notably, these are not one-off measures but instead recurring measures that are implemented as part of ongoing business processes for which it is not possible to make any estimates with regard to financial figures. As part of the implemented management systems, either an environmental programme (in accordance with ISO 14001/EMAS at VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH) or a plan of action (in accordance with ISO 14001/IMS at Gas Connect Austria) is continuously updated and implemented. This also includes the appropriate planning of resources. Technical actions have already substantially reduced emissions that contribute to pollution. The phasing out of hard coal in the generation of electricity and district heating has eliminated SO2 and dust emissions. Furthermore, the transition to hydrogen should prevent future airborne emissions. At the Mellach power plants site, flue gas purification equipment minimises emissions of environmentally harmful substances into the air. As this is already the best available technology, there are currently no improvement options or key actions planned until new technologies become available. Research projects are carried out on an ongoing basis to gain new insights and deepen the understanding on existing issues. To avoid and mitigate potential impacts on people and the natural environment in the event of emergencies and incidents, there are appropriate emergency and crisis plans available for companies and sites. These plans also take into account the risk of air pollution that may occur in the event of incidents. In 2023, additional official environmental inspections along with in-depth reviews pursuant to the Industrial Accident Ordinance were carried out and passed in Mellach. In accordance with the requirements of the Regulation on the Protection of Workers from Explosive Atmospheres (Verordnung explosionsfähige Atmosphären, VEXAT), Gas Connect Austria gas plants are categorised into defined potentially explosive areas, so-called “Ex zones”, and process areas with regard to explosion protection,"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 247 The Scope 3 categories that are significant to VERBUND’s GHG balance were analysed as significant according to the criteria: Category 1 (Purchased goods and services), Category 2 (Capital goods), Category 3 (Fuel and energy-related activities not included in Scope 1 or 2), Category 6 (Business travel), Category 11 (Use of sold products) and Category 15 (Investments, i.e. equity interests) for VERBUND. The analysis was based on the previously conducted Corporate Carbon Footprint (CCF) calculations in the Sustainability Data Management Tool, the consideration of new business activities and an assessment using ecoinvent factors. Category 6 is included despite its very low share of Scope 3 emissions as it was deemed significant for employee engagement. In the downstream value chain, VERBUND’s equity interests were analysed based on ESRS requirements. Not previously included until 2023, Scope 3 Category 15 was therefore included in the CCF. To ensure comparability between the current and the previous reporting periods, the GHG emissions of equity interests were also added for the 2020 base year, and reported for the previous year 2023. Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 15 were included in VERBUND’s GHG emissions inventory. All GHG emission factors are recorded in the Sustainability Data Management Tool. They are continuously updated and adjusted in line with the latest findings and requirements. This methodology ensures that GHG emissions inventories are mapped consistently and in a comparative manner. Emission factors specific to VERBUND are calculated for upstream and downstream GHG emissions based on the currently available version of the ecoinvent database, and taking into account all types of greenhouse gases in accordance with the IPCC. GHG emissions emitted are measured in CO2 equivalents (CO2e), taking into account national, regional and company-specific emission factors. In Scope 3, fully consolidated as well as non-consolidated companies under the operational control of VERBUND are documented similarly to Scope 1 and 2. See also paragraph Methods, key assumptions and emission factors. Scope 3 – GHG intensity of electricity deliveries to consumers The specific value of indirect GHG emissions from the purchase and supply of electricity to consumers in 2024 was 256 g CO2e/kWh of electricity delivered to consumers. Scope 3 GHG emissions intensity Unit 2020 2023 2024 Gross Scope 3 GHG emissions from electricity sales to consumers per total electricity sales to consumers g CO2e/kWh 324 252 256 Different reporting periods in the value chain In cases where VERBUND has an alternative reporting period or an earlier data consolidation timepoint than some or all of the entities in its value chain with regard to annual reporting, the GHG emissions referred to in paragraph 44 are measured using information for reporting periods that deviate from the VERBUND reporting period. The value chain uses the currently available data from these entities to report the GHG emissions. VERBUND uses annual figures, and accepts data from the entities for reporting periods of equal length. If impacts of significant events and changes in circumstances relevant to VERBUND GHG emissions"
"248 occur between the reporting dates of entities in its value chain, and the date of the undertaking's financial statements for general purposes, a corresponding disclosure will be published in the next annual report. Significant changes and their impacts on GHG emissions There were several significant changes that made it necessary to recalculate the 2020 base year of the CCF based on the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. These changes are designed to permit better future control over target achievement in relation to GHG emissions. Recalculations of the CCF are performed and documented in the event of material changes or errors. Regardless of whether they cause the values to rise or fall, they are considered material if they account for more than 5% of the relevant scope in the base year or reporting year. The acquisition of the gas network operator Gas Connect Austria was taken into account in the base year in accordance with the requirements of the GHG Protocol, producing a 13% increase in Scope 1 emissions in 2020. The electricity consumption of Gas Connect Austria for Scope 2 market-based emissions was recalculated, GHG emissions from the grid purchases of power plants were reallocated on the basis of CSRD requirements, and the emission factor for the unknown electricity mix was changed to reflect the EU mix. In total, market-based Scope 2 emissions rose by 11% in 2020. Notably, the target for Scope 3 emissions produced by electricity sales to consumers required a transition from the location- based approach to the market-based approach in order to allow the figure to be controlled through the active and successive transition to renewable energy among industrial customers. This led to an increase in emissions Category 3 in 2020. The inclusion of Category 15 Investments in accordance with the requirements of ESRS standards and their significance, led to a further increase in Scope 3 emissions. In total, Scope 3 emissions then rose by 21% in 2020. All changes in the GHG emissions calculation, such as the inclusion of non-consolidated companies, the transition to a market-based approach for electricity sales to consumers and the inclusion of investments, were taken into account in all Scopes in 2023. This produced a 0% change in Scope 1 emissions, a 4% increase in Scope 2 location-based emissions, and a 6% decrease in Scope 2 market- based emissions, with Scope 3 emissions falling by 1%. Consistent reporting and comparability between the previous year (2023) and the new 2024 reporting period is thereby ensured.

"252 ESRS E3 Water and marine resources ESRS 2 General Disclosures VERBUND is committed to the sustainable and responsible use of water. The strategic focus of the VERBUND Group on renewable generation technologies and the associated decommissioning of thermal power plants powered by hard coal, lignite and crude oil are the factors that had the greatest impact on the conservation of water resources. Since 2020, natural gas has only been used for generation at one site, and the partial recirculation of the cooling water also offers high savings potential at the same site. Generation from hydropower plays only a minor role with regard to the topics covered by this standard, as the hydropower plant operations utilise the potential and kinetic energy of water and convert this energy into electricity. In the process, the water is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively changed and is not consumed. As a result, the water flowing through hydropower plant turbines is returned directly to the body of water concerned without any changes to its biochemical composition. Since all of VERBUND’s storage power plants are annual or daily storage plants, they are not used for long-term water storage over the course of several years. Compared with energetic utilisation, in terms of volume, the withdrawal of cooling water and service water at hydropower plants is of minor significance and these withdrawals are also returned. Effluent is either discharged through the public sewer system, or, at sites that are not connected to the public sewer system, is discharged after it is treated in line with the statutory provisions or official notices from the authority. Potential hydropower-specific impacts on water habitats are described under Biodiversity and ecosystems (see section E4 SBM-3). Wind farms and photovoltaic installations, gas grid systems and power grid installations only withdraw, discharge and consume small quantities of water. The offices and administrative sites at these facilities consume drinking water, and the only water discharged into the water system is of household quality. Once specific activities are planned or initiated, the business activities related to the production, storage or transport of hydrogen set forth in the VERBUND strategy will be analysed in more detail with respect to their impacts, risks and opportunities in connection with the use of water resources. Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material water and marine resources-related impacts, risks and opportunities Topic-specific disclosures on processes to identify and assess material water and marine resources- related impacts, risks and opportunities can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1. Disclosure requirement E3-1 – Policies related to water and marine resources VERBUND’s environmental mission statement stipulates the Group-wide commitment to preventing or mitigating environmental impacts. The statement also sets forth action to reduce emissions, make efficient use of resources and preserve and promote biodiversity. Potential negative impacts arising from water withdrawals are avoided to the greatest possible extent at VERBUND. Water withdrawals are only relevant at the Mellach site of VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH, which is committed to continuously improving the environmental situation. In addition to ISO 14001 certification, the Mellach thermal generation facilities are validated according to the EMAS III Regulation. EMAS is therefore the central policy.

The acquisition of the gas network operator Gas Connect Austria was taken into account in the base year in accordance with the requirements of the GHG Protocol, producing a 13% increase in Scope 1 emissions in 2020. The electricity consumption of Gas Connect Austria for Scope 2 market-based emissions was recalculated, GHG emissions from the grid purchases of power plants were reallocated on the basis of CSRD requirements, and the emission factor for the unknown electricity mix was changed to reflect the EU mix. In total, market-based Scope 2 emissions rose by 11% in 2020. Notably, the target for Scope 3 emissions produced by electricity sales to consumers required a transition from the location- based approach to the market-based approach in order to allow the figure to be controlled through the active and successive transition to renewable energy among industrial customers. This led to an increase in emissions Category 3 in 2020. The inclusion of Category 15 Investments in accordance with the requirements of ESRS standards and their significance, led to a further increase in Scope 3 emissions. In total, Scope 3 emissions then rose by 21% in 2020. All changes in the GHG emissions calculation, such as the inclusion of non-consolidated companies, the transition to a market-based approach for electricity sales to consumers and the inclusion of investments, were taken into account in all Scopes in 2023. This produced a 0% change in Scope 1 emissions, a 4% increase in Scope 2 location-based emissions, and a 6% decrease in Scope 2 market- based emissions, with Scope 3 emissions falling by 1%. Consistent reporting and comparability between the previous year (2023) and the new 2024 reporting period is thereby ensured.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 249 Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing As an energy supplier and electricity producer, carbon pricing is a key cost factor for VERBUND that needs to be included in corporate decisions at every level. The VERBUND business strategy is based on modelled future business scenarios. Carbon pricing is one of the metrics used to develop these scenarios, which include energy market performance in Europe and impacts on VERBUND power plants. Carbon prices also play a key role in assessing future generation technologies and investment decisions. Given that carbon prices are expected to rise substantially over the coming years, the incentive to reduce GHG emissions while increasing the share of electricity generated from renewable energies, and investing in the development of low-carbon technologies will grow. This is in line with VERBUND’s strategic projects and supports the achievement of climate-related goals. The internal carbon price forms part of the assumptions applicable to the internal VERBUND Energy Market Model (VEMM). The results of the VEMM are used for budget planning, investment decisions and impairment testing VERBUND’s power plants. The incorporated internal carbon price is based on the EU ETS price and forms part of VERBUND’s planning assumptions. These planning assumptions must be applied by all parts of VERBUND, both when making investment decisions and reviewing existing plants. As all of the Group’s divisions are located in EU member states, the internal carbon price is applied throughout the Group. Around 479,000 tonnes, or 96% of VERBUND’s Scope 1 emissions, are measured using the internal carbon price. Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions are not included in the internal carbon pricing. All current applications use the carbon price, which corresponds to the current prices listed on the stock exchange (ICE, EEX). The long-term performance of the carbon price is based on assumptions made by international consulting firms. An average price from all available external scenarios is used as the base scenario for determining the long-term performance of carbon prices. Price forecasts are used to measure the value in use, determine fair values and ascertain the impairment of assets. More details are available in the consolidated financial statements. The prices applied in 2024 were in the region of €67/t CO2e. VERBUND expects carbon prices to rise sharply in the long term.

"250 Disclosure Requirement E2-1 – Policies related to pollution It is crucial for VERBUND to manage material negative impacts in order to avoid and mitigate air pollution. In addition to ensuring compliance with regulatory obligations, VERBUND’s policies also focus on incidents and emergency situations with regard to air pollution. The policies at subsidiary level contain specifications regarding emissions into the air. VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH also has its own environmental policy. The thermal generation plants in Mellach are validated in accordance with the EMAS regulation in addition to ISO 14001. This means that an environmental statement in accordance with the EMAS III Regulation has been issued exclusively for the Mellach power plants site. At Gas Connect Austria GmbH, an integrated management system that meets the requirements of an environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001 is externally certified on an annual basis. Air pollutants, among other things, are reported in the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (in the future industrial emissions portal) for the Mellach power plants site and for Gas Connect Austria GmbH in accordance with the E-PRTR regulation. The management systems in place at VERBUND ensure that improvement processes are continuously pursued while simultaneously defining areas of application, roles, responsibilities, accounting for context and stakeholder interests, and establishing the assessment of risks and opportunities. Accordingly, the topic of air pollution is continuously addressed and corresponding targets, actions, and a monitoring process are derived on this basis. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1. Disclosure Requirement E2-2 – Actions and resources related to pollution VERBUND continuously introduces actions to avoid and mitigate air pollution, and allocates appropriate funds for this purpose. Notably, these are not one-off measures but instead recurring measures that are implemented as part of ongoing business processes for which it is not possible to make any estimates with regard to financial figures. As part of the implemented management systems, either an environmental programme (in accordance with ISO 14001/EMAS at VERBUND Thermal Power GmbH) or a plan of action (in accordance with ISO 14001/IMS at Gas Connect Austria) is continuously updated and implemented. This also includes the appropriate planning of resources. Technical actions have already substantially reduced emissions that contribute to pollution. The phasing out of hard coal in the generation of electricity and district heating has eliminated SO2 and dust emissions. Furthermore, the transition to hydrogen should prevent future airborne emissions. At the Mellach power plants site, flue gas purification equipment minimises emissions of environmentally harmful substances into the air. As this is already the best available technology, there are currently no improvement options or key actions planned until new technologies become available. Research projects are carried out on an ongoing basis to gain new insights and deepen the understanding on existing issues. To avoid and mitigate potential impacts on people and the natural environment in the event of emergencies and incidents, there are appropriate emergency and crisis plans available for companies and sites. These plans also take into account the risk of air pollution that may occur in the event of incidents. In 2023, additional official environmental inspections along with in-depth reviews pursuant to the Industrial Accident Ordinance were carried out and passed in Mellach.

"252 ESRS E3 Water and marine resources ESRS 2 General Disclosures VERBUND is committed to the sustainable and responsible use of water. The strategic focus of the VERBUND Group on renewable generation technologies and the associated decommissioning of thermal power plants powered by hard coal, lignite and crude oil are the factors that had the greatest impact on the conservation of water resources. Since 2020, natural gas has only been used for generation at one site, and the partial recirculation of the cooling water also offers high savings potential at the same site. Generation from hydropower plays only a minor role with regard to the topics covered by this standard, as the hydropower plant operations utilise the potential and kinetic energy of water and convert this energy into electricity. In the process, the water is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively changed and is not consumed. As a result, the water flowing through hydropower plant turbines is returned directly to the body of water concerned without any changes to its biochemical composition. Since all of VERBUND’s storage power plants are annual or daily storage plants, they are not used for long-term water storage over the course of several years. Compared with energetic utilisation, in terms of volume, the withdrawal of cooling water and service water at hydropower plants is of minor significance and these withdrawals are also returned. Effluent is either discharged through the public sewer system, or, at sites that are not connected to the public sewer system, is discharged after it is treated in line with the statutory provisions or official notices from the authority. Potential hydropower-specific impacts on water habitats are described under Biodiversity and ecosystems (see section E4 SBM-3). Wind farms and photovoltaic installations, gas grid systems and power grid installations only withdraw, discharge and consume small quantities of water. The offices and administrative sites at these facilities consume drinking water, and the only water discharged into the water system is of household quality. Once specific activities are planned or initiated, the business activities related to the production, storage or transport of hydrogen set forth in the VERBUND strategy will be analysed in more detail with respect to their impacts, risks and opportunities in connection with the use of water resources.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 253 made publicly available to stakeholders for the Mellach power plant site, which also contains detailed information on water management, namely on the use of water resources in the Group’s own operations (input, output, process water, river water, effluent, treatment). The management systems in place at VERBUND ensure that improvement processes are continuously pursued while simultaneously defining areas of application, roles, responsibilities, the consideration of context and stakeholder interests, and the establishment of a risk and opportunity assessment. This approach guarantees that the topic of water is continuously addressed and corresponding targets, actions and a monitoring process are derived on this basis. In order to determine whether sites with a relevant impact on water resources are located in areas at water risk, the potential impacts and risks of VERBUND segments in connection with water resources were first identified. A particular focus was placed on the thermal generation facility. Mapping the location of this VERBUND operational site against the location of areas with high or very high water stress according to the World Resources Institute’s (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas revealed that the water risk in the selected area is marked as “low”. Certain wind power and photovoltaic installations are located in areas with high water stress, but no significant water withdrawal takes place at these sites. Water is only used to clean the installations on an as-needed basis. As a result, there are currently no policies, actions or targets in place for areas affected by water risks. Similarly, no specific policies or practices are pursued with respect to the design of products and services in relation to water-related issues or marine resources, as these topics are not directly related to VERBUND’s current business activities. Information on stakeholder engagement can be found in ESRS 2 IRO-1. Disclosure Requirement E3-2 – Actions and resources related to water and marine resources Where necessary, guidelines relating to actions to potentially reduce water withdrawals are set by the company concerned. At the Mellach site, cooling water is withdrawn directly from the Mur River (freshwater cooling at Mellach district heating power plant and combined cycle gas turbine plant generator 10) or supplied through cooling tower recirculation (evaporative cooling for combined cycle gas turbine plant generator 20). After being used, the cooling water is returned to the source water body with automated temperature control to ensure compliance with legal thresholds (maximum warming of 3°C and maximum temperature of 25°C). For process water, most of the water is withdrawn from the Mur River and, once the purified effluents have been reintroduced to the source water body, the water is returned to the natural cycle. Measures such as optimising the main cooling circuit and implementing a new central demineralisation plant have already been successfully implemented in Mellach to reduce the use of freshwater. Together with the relevant audit reports and the environmental programme, the EMAS environmental management system at the Mellach site demonstrates the effectiveness of the management system. Specific findings or potential areas of improvement are determined on an annual basis. An environmental programme in place at the Mellach power plant site is continuously updated and implemented. The programme also incorporates adequate resource planning and monitoring implementation progress. Notably, these are not one-off actions but instead recurring actions that form part of ongoing business processes for which it is not possible to make any estimates with regard to financial figures. Since no water withdrawals take place in areas affected by water risks, no corresponding"
"254 actions have been defined. At the Mellach site, no actions have been taken to further reduce water withdrawals. Accordingly there are no related allocated ressources. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E3-3 – Targets related to water and marine resources A target for reducing water withdrawals was defined for the period 2015 to 2021 and surpassed in 2020. Accordingly, since 2020, the volume of water withdrawals has remained within the targeted range or below and is only influenced by operational fluctuations. As the current volume of water withdrawals already meets the minimum technical requirements, no specific targets have been set at present to further reduce water withdrawals. Relevant certificates, audit reports and management assessments are evidence that management systems have been implemented at VERBUND, and that they are also effective. Environmental and management system officers are tasked with identifying specific findings and areas for improvement. The effectiveness of actions is continuously monitored in the respective environmental management system without any specified level to be met. Disclosure requirement E3-4 – Water consumption Although water consumption is not associated with any material impacts, risks or opportunities, water use nevertheless is monitored and reported on in a standardised approach throughout the Group. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the resource flow, the following table “Water input and output” also includes the metrics of total water consumption, water stored, water discharge and water intensity, which are not considered material. The total volume of stored water refers to the usable storage volume of the dams operated by VERBUND Hydropower. Water is stored exclusively for the purpose of postponing the use of the water supply. VERBUND operates short-term storage facilities (daily and weekly storage) and long-term storage facilities (annual storage), which perform essential functions in the power system and will continue to grow in significance as a largely renewable energy system of the future requires flexibility and storage options, such as the flexibility of the power plant portfolio and the use of storage. The change in storage relates to a change in the usable storage capacity and amounted to zero in the 2024 reporting period. There is no water treatment for recycled or reused water at VERBUND. The volume of total water consumption, water withdrawal and water discharge have increased compared to the previous year, mainly due to the particularly low generation volume of thermal power plants in 2023. In 2024, the water metrics generally returned to roughly the same level as in 2022. Reduced thermal generation in 2023 strongly affected the water intensity metric, which is why it was up in 2024. Compared with 2020 (3,458 m3/GWh), an intensity reduction of 51% was achieved in 2024 relative to total electricity generation, bringing the figure to 1,678 m3/GWh."

Endangered species listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List are also found in the areas in which many VERBUND facilities operate. At these sites, VERBUND takes measures to protect and conserve these species, and adheres to all relevant rules, regulations and requirements associated with the protection of species and biodiversity. Likewise, the requirements of protected species and protected habitats are also taken into account in the ongoing operation of facilities and in the management of land. Despite constantly taking all legal requirements into account and pursuing additional efforts and measures, the aforementioned impacts of the individual generation technologies cannot be excluded in biodiversity sensitive areas. Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of processes to identify and assess material biodiversity and ecosystem-related impacts, risks and opportunities Topic-specific disclosures on processes to identify and assess material biodiversity and ecosystem- related impacts, risks and opportunities can be found in sections ESRS 2 IRO-1 and ESRS 2 SBM-3. Disclosure Requirement E4-2 – Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems Biodiversity has been an integral part of the environmental mission statement and the Code of Conduct for Sustainable Business for several years now. In order to highlight the importance of biodiversity at VERBUND, a biodiversity policy was developed in 2024. The policy covers VERBUND and all consolidated companies with their direct activities in all nations in which VERBUND operates, with the exception of Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH. The biodiversity policy sets forth principles and practices already in place and provides them with an internal definition. With these provisions, VERBUND addresses the following impact drivers from the materiality assessment: changes in the use of land and freshwater, direct exploitation, impacts on the condition of"
"266 species and ecosystems. The main requirements of the VERBUND biodiversity policy include alignment with the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy, impact monitoring, the continuous improvement of actions, stakeholder engagement, and collaboration with the fields of science and research. VERBUND regulates the management of biodiversity and ecosystem-related risks and impacts by adhering to the steps of avoidance, minimisation, restoration, and compensation of remaining impacts. Social repercussions of impacts related to biodiversity and ecosystems are taken into account in VERBUND internal policies, as described in the Affected communities section. A consistent approach to the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy implies sustainable land-use practices, sustainable forestry and the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems, in particular of protected areas and biodiversity sensitive areas. However, VERBUND has not implemented any Group-wide policies to specifically address these issues beyond the biodiversity policy. International strategies and targets, such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy, the Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 15 Life on land, the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention, CMS), the Convention on Wetlands (Ramsar Convention) and the International Convention on biodiversity (CBD), also provide a framework for planning ecosystem-related projects and were accounted for during the preparation of the VERBUND biodiversity policy. VERBUND is working to mitigate the root causes of biodiversity loss by expanding renewable energies and transmission capacities to promote climate change mitigation and the efficient use of resources with accompanying environmental measures and sustainable land management concepts. Transmission system operator Austrian Power Grid has developed a comprehensive mission statement for sustainable habitat management. One of the cornerstones of this strategy is ecological route maintenance, which is intended to minimise or completely avoid interference with the landscape and the balance of nature. At Austrian Power Grid, sustainable habitat management is based on the following four guiding principles: • Ensuring operational safety is of the utmost priority. Austrian Power Grid maintenance personnel are responsible for implementing measures that are absolutely necessary to achieve this. Where there are several options for ensuring security of supply, the property owner makes the final decision. • Austrian Power Grid takes a precautionary approach to high-voltage system maintenance by avoiding any encroachment on the local community and their environment to the best of its ability. • Austrian Power Grid gears its upkeep activities towards the natural potential of the site and its surroundings. In so doing, it endeavours to establish harmony between the natural landscape and the man-made elements in the region. Austrian Power Grid maintenance personnel are available to property owners and advocacy groups in an advisory capacity and promote awareness of the advantages of ecological route upkeep. • Austrian Power Grid wants to promote ecologically valuable projects in the region. Pipeline operator Gas Connect Austria GmbH has also enshrined in its mission statement that the impact of its business activities on people and the environment must be taken into account in a sustainable manner. This also includes accounting for biodiversity. Above all, this guiding principle is reflected in the implementation of projects. A large number of measures are being taken as a result of official requirements which focus on protecting biodiversity. As a rule, Gas Connect Austria GmbH is guided by the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy when implementing projects that impact biodiversity and ecosystems."
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 267 Disclosure requirement E4-3 – Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems Environmental measures have been an important part of the construction and operation of VERBUND, Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH plants for many years. Many actions result from binding commitments such as laws and orders, and relate to the material impacts of VERBUND’s activities. In addition, VERBUND voluntarily pursues additional actions to protect, conserve and promote biodiversity. Actions are taken along the project life cycle according to the mitigation hierarchy steps of avoidance, minimisation, restoration, and compensation or offsetting. As early as in the project planning phase, potential negative impacts are avoided to the greatest possible extent through the choice of location, project organisation, scheduling and stakeholder involvement. Actions to ensure continuous environmental functionality (CEF) are implemented before any action is taken in natural habitats. VERBUND also resettles protected animal and plant species as necessary for preventive purposes. During the construction of facilities, impacts on fauna, flora and habitats are monitored and minimised to the greatest possible extent. Before, during or after the completion of projects, seeding and planting take place along with the creation or restoration of habitats. A wide variety of suitable actions are implemented, for example, near-natural structures such as gravel bars, rock piles, deadwood, as well as meadow orchards, hedge structures and extensive grassland. Where compensatory actions or replacement habitats are required, they are implemented or created to the necessary extent. Replacement habitats are designed in such a way as to be able to achieve an additional ecological enhancement of the areas in question. The costs of these actions are taken into account in the project budget and are therefore part of expansion projects. At present, the monetary impacts from the implementation of compensatory actions are not collected or disclosed separately and therefore cannot be reported. In 2024, the European electricity industry association Eurelectric developed a guide entitled “Guidebook to electrify in harmony with nature” on integrating biodiversity into planning and implementing projects related to the expansion of renewable energy under the project title Power Plant 2.0. VERBUND experts contributed to the preparation of the document, allowing them to share their knowledge and benefit from valuable exchanges on biodiversity issues. The biodiversity guide sets forth twelve principles that need to be taken into account in biodiversity-related projects. Specific examples of how VERBUND and other electric utilities in Europe are successfully applying these principles in projects are also included in the guide. Aquatic actions Connecting riverways is of great significance in restoring the natural diversity of revitalised stretches, in genetic exchange and in balancing out population fluctuations. Establishing fish passes enables fish and other organisms to pass through the barrage barriers and continue their migration in the usual way. The fish passes, most of which are designed to blend in with their surroundings, offer additional habitats for flora and fauna. At power plant sites where there is either limited land availability or a large altitude difference to overcome, technical fish passes are erected. Numerous projects are being carried out in cooperation with scientists to examine how fish passes can be optimised, and the findings are being incorporated into future planning at hydropower plant sites. Other measures aimed at promoting biodiversity in the vicinity of hydropower plants include designing riparian zones near bodies of water in accordance with ecological criteria. Such projects entail structural measures and morphological improvements, for example creating shallow water areas and additional side channels. Capital"
"268 expenditure in the region of €400m has been earmarked for the implementation of these environmental actions at rivers by 2027 (see section E4-4). VERBUND has started to conduct feasibility studies for all bodies of water affected by hydropeaking to reduce the impacts of hydropeaking and drops on water habitats. Work on three stretches of water is currently in the report preparation phase following the completion of active adaptions. Residual water studies were initiated at 13 diversion power plants in Styria to assess residual water discharge. Initial preparatory work began in 2024 and the project will be completed in the course of 2025. Rehabilitation measures that have already been implemented and are currently planned in connection with a turbine replacement not only promote the energy yield of existing power plants, but also reduce turbine-related damage to fish through limited clearance measures and improved turbine geometries. Measures are being implemented on the Inn River in partnership with the WWF, the Natopia Association, Naturium Inn, and the Technical University of Munich as part of the INNsieme action plan. The project aims to improve biodiversity and restore a vibrant Inn River through integrated pilot measures and runs from 2023 to 2026. It consists of three modules: species protection measures, restoration of ecological networks and publicity. Three restoration projects are being planned as part of the restoration of ecological networks module. These projects are being executed as part of a participatory planning process in which the public is actively involved. The aim is to reconnect lateral tributaries and improve the continuity of the river network. Gravel spawning grounds and juvenile fish habitats will be created or restored in the process. In detail, the plans already include a flow-through distributary in the tailrace of the Perach power plant. Concepts for optimised bedload management will also be developed and implemented. LIFE projects LIFE projects are often implemented in close coordination with the responsible ministry, the waterway operator viadonau, the National Park Donau-Auen, the offices of the state governments, the state fishing associations, and the landowners. VERBUND is currently involved in five LIFE projects on the rivers Danube, Inn and Enns rivers: LIFE Network Danube+ (2019–2024), LIFE Riverscape Lower Inn (2020– 2028), LIFE Blue Belt Danube Inn (2021–2029), LIFE Wild Island (2021–2027), and LIFE Nature WeNatureEnns (2024–2031). The following measures are being taken as part of these projects: • Fish passes constructed as semi-natural bypasses, where possible, in line with the pursuit of nature- based solutions; • Lateral expansion of rivers to promote dynamic riparian zones; • Desedimentation measures in the foodplains along the river; • Structuring measures in the vicinity of reservoir heads to promote the formation of islands and distributaries; • Forest management measures to promote protected riparian forest habitats; • Ecological upkeep measures, including on river embankments to promote protected dry sites; and • Management of non-native and invasive species. Kilometre stretches of semi-natural rivers have already been created around the power plants in Ottensheim, Abwinden-Asten, Greifenstein, Altenwörth, Ering-Frauenstein and Braunau-Simbach. Over the coming years, semi-natural bypasses will also be built at the power plants in Jochenstein and Egglfing,"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 269 and fish passes at all power plants on the Danube and Inn Rivers will allow fish to migrate to key habitats largely unhindered. Large island distributary systems have already been implemented downstream of the Ottensheim- Wilhering and Ering-Frauenstein power plants and are planned for further sites as part of LIFE projects. Measures for the de-sedimentation of silted-up-foodplains have already been implemented on the Inn and Danube rivers, and will be implemented in many more reservoirs over the coming years, starting at the Aschach and Jochenstein reservoirs. Research Several research projects are conducting scientific studies to explore sustainable, ecologically effective actions in river habitats over the course of several years. The aim is to enhance the value of the aquatic habitat while continuing to meet society’s high expectations when it comes to sustainable, economically viable hydropower generation. In the ÖkoResch project, for example, researchers from the BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences will be scientifically monitoring planned measures to limit hydropeaking and studying the effect of new residual water releases on aquatic habitats in alpine regions. Research will be conducted over the course of six years (2020–2026). The long duration of the project stems primarily from the necessary field work in the high-alpine habitat. These research activities are carried out in bodies of water affected by hydropeaking and semi-natural reference waters. Dotation tests are also being conducted at representative test sites. At VERBUND, the Hundskehlbach catchment is currently being investigated. Based on the analyses, an ecological assessment and monitoring system will be developed by the end of the project. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sediment Research and Management (BOKU) is evaluating ecologically compatible options for sediment remobilisation. In addition, a new sensor method is being studied at the Gries power plant on the Salzach River to record the beginning and end of bedload transport during water lowering processes. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Meta Ecosystem Dynamics in Riverine Landscapes (MERI) (BOKU) is analysing the long-term added value of selected LIFE projects on the Danube. The fish bypass project in partnership with Graz University of Technology and engineering offices that specialise in the environment is dedicated to the effects of transverse structures on the fish population, which are assessed in the laboratory and at the sites themselves. The project results will be published and presented at conferences in Germany and Austria in 2025. In collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, the migration behaviour and habitat use of selected fish species are being closely studied in the Inn River with the use of fish tagging based on PIT tags. PIT tag antennas were installed at a total of 25 sites, 12 of which were equipped with fish passes, to analyse the tagged fish. In collaboration with the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, the impacts of the restoration measures at the Ering-Frauenstein power plant were examined to determine the population dynamics of selected fish species. The project was completed in late 2023 with the findings subsequently presented and published in international publications in 2024. Terrestrial actions In the future, additional measures will be taken to promote biodiversity in the terrestrial ecosystems of green spaces owned by VERBUND. Easy-to-implement measures for the management, procurement and design of green spaces at VERBUND are set forth in an internal VERBUND catalogue of biodiversity"
"270 measures along with resulting areas of potential. Sections in the catalogue include background information, best practices and recommendations for action on topics such as mowing management, creating structures such as rock piles, deadwood elements, or hedges, forest management, commissioning services on VERBUND plots of land, planting and seeding, and the management of non- native and invasive species. The catalogue of measures was published and communicated internally by VERBUND in 2024 and is intended to raise environmental awareness among employees and to serve as a basis for sustainable management plans. The actions listed below with regard to terrestrial ecosystems are often part of larger projects, or recurring or continuous activities related to the upkeep, cultivation or management of land, which is why estimations cannot be provided for financial figures. The following actions have been taken in particular in relation to sustainable land-use practices, including forest management: In 2024, the forest area owned by VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH was certified as active, sustainable and climate-fit in accordance with the quality criteria of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). PEFC Austria develops standards and procedures for the system used to certify the domestic forests and the entire downstream value chain. A tree cadastre was introduced in 2024 to allow trees to be preserved for longer so that the special potential of old trees, as habitat trees and carriers of microhabitats, can be utilised. Such microhabitats provide dedicated habitats for animal, plant, lichen and fungus species. Woodpecker and detritus cavities and hollows in these old trees along with exposed wood and deadwood also provide a diverse range of food and habitat for various species. Road safety assessments in accordance with ÖNORM L1122 in conjunction with ÖNORM L1125 (tree cadastre) are required to maintain these valuable habitat trees in areas frequented by the public or by operating personnel. The Altenwörth and Greifenstein power plants are located in the Tullnerfelder-Donau-Auen Natura 2000 area. VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH and other landowners participated in the project “Development of an inter-company forest biodiversity monitoring and management concept for maintaining and promoting biodiversity in the Tullnerfelder-Donau-Auen Natura 2000 area” (WAMO). All surveys (inventory sampling, mapping of forest biodiversity elements, faunistic surveys, including bird species surveys) were carried out and completed in 2024. The final report will be published in 2025. Timber harvesting has largely been switched to modern felling and extraction techniques where possible in recent years. Particular care is taken when introducing rejuvenation measures to ensure that the trees to be removed are intentionally felled to protect saplings. Felling work is carried out with harvesters where possible only under suitable soil conditions (dry or frozen). When used with care, harvesters can reduce soil contamination and protect fauna and flora. VERBUND leases grasslands to farms as well and often sets out criteria in leases, including bans on fertilising and spraying for semi-natural, biodiversity-enhancing land management. Information on the types of land use and related intensity along with ecological cultivation is obtained from Agrarmarkt Austria and, subject to consent being granted by leaseholders, is transmitted to VERBUND to obtain an overview of the land use. Extensive cultivation is intended not only to avoid the introduction of herbicides and fertilisers along with the associated loss of species, but also to contribute to soil protection through reduced driving on the land and thereby reduce the load placed on the soil by agricultural equipment. In green spaces located close to bodies of water, the biodiversity of plants and animals (such as rare orchids, herbs, wild bees, lizards, grasshoppers, butterflies and spiders) is promoted through responsible meadow management and ecological maintenance measures.

A wide variety of suitable actions are implemented, for example, near-natural structures such as gravel bars, rock piles, deadwood, as well as meadow orchards, hedge structures and extensive grassland. Where compensatory actions or replacement habitats are required, they are implemented or created to the necessary extent. Replacement habitats are designed in such a way as to be able to achieve an additional ecological enhancement of the areas in question. The costs of these actions are taken into account in the project budget and are therefore part of expansion projects. At present, the monetary impacts from the implementation of compensatory actions are not collected or disclosed separately and therefore cannot be reported. In 2024, the European electricity industry association Eurelectric developed a guide entitled “Guidebook to electrify in harmony with nature” on integrating biodiversity into planning and implementing projects related to the expansion of renewable energy under the project title Power Plant 2.0. VERBUND experts contributed to the preparation of the document, allowing them to share their knowledge and benefit from valuable exchanges on biodiversity issues. The biodiversity guide sets forth twelve principles that need to be taken into account in biodiversity-related projects. Specific examples of how VERBUND and other electric utilities in Europe are successfully applying these principles in projects are also included in the guide. Aquatic actions Connecting riverways is of great significance in restoring the natural diversity of revitalised stretches, in genetic exchange and in balancing out population fluctuations. Establishing fish passes enables fish and other organisms to pass through the barrage barriers and continue their migration in the usual way. The fish passes, most of which are designed to blend in with their surroundings, offer additional habitats for flora and fauna. At power plant sites where there is either limited land availability or a large altitude difference to overcome, technical fish passes are erected. Numerous projects are being carried out in cooperation with scientists to examine how fish passes can be optimised, and the findings are being incorporated into future planning at hydropower plant sites. Other measures aimed at promoting biodiversity in the vicinity of hydropower plants include designing riparian zones near bodies of water in accordance with ecological criteria. Such projects entail structural measures and morphological improvements, for example creating shallow water areas and additional side channels. Capital"
"268 expenditure in the region of €400m has been earmarked for the implementation of these environmental actions at rivers by 2027 (see section E4-4). VERBUND has started to conduct feasibility studies for all bodies of water affected by hydropeaking to reduce the impacts of hydropeaking and drops on water habitats. Work on three stretches of water is currently in the report preparation phase following the completion of active adaptions. Residual water studies were initiated at 13 diversion power plants in Styria to assess residual water discharge. Initial preparatory work began in 2024 and the project will be completed in the course of 2025. Rehabilitation measures that have already been implemented and are currently planned in connection with a turbine replacement not only promote the energy yield of existing power plants, but also reduce turbine-related damage to fish through limited clearance measures and improved turbine geometries. Measures are being implemented on the Inn River in partnership with the WWF, the Natopia Association, Naturium Inn, and the Technical University of Munich as part of the INNsieme action plan. The project aims to improve biodiversity and restore a vibrant Inn River through integrated pilot measures and runs from 2023 to 2026. It consists of three modules: species protection measures, restoration of ecological networks and publicity. Three restoration projects are being planned as part of the restoration of ecological networks module. These projects are being executed as part of a participatory planning process in which the public is actively involved. The aim is to reconnect lateral tributaries and improve the continuity of the river network. Gravel spawning grounds and juvenile fish habitats will be created or restored in the process. In detail, the plans already include a flow-through distributary in the tailrace of the Perach power plant. Concepts for optimised bedload management will also be developed and implemented. LIFE projects LIFE projects are often implemented in close coordination with the responsible ministry, the waterway operator viadonau, the National Park Donau-Auen, the offices of the state governments, the state fishing associations, and the landowners. VERBUND is currently involved in five LIFE projects on the rivers Danube, Inn and Enns rivers: LIFE Network Danube+ (2019–2024), LIFE Riverscape Lower Inn (2020– 2028), LIFE Blue Belt Danube Inn (2021–2029), LIFE Wild Island (2021–2027), and LIFE Nature WeNatureEnns (2024–2031). The following measures are being taken as part of these projects: • Fish passes constructed as semi-natural bypasses, where possible, in line with the pursuit of nature- based solutions; • Lateral expansion of rivers to promote dynamic riparian zones; • Desedimentation measures in the foodplains along the river; • Structuring measures in the vicinity of reservoir heads to promote the formation of islands and distributaries; • Forest management measures to promote protected riparian forest habitats; • Ecological upkeep measures, including on river embankments to promote protected dry sites; and • Management of non-native and invasive species. Kilometre stretches of semi-natural rivers have already been created around the power plants in Ottensheim, Abwinden-Asten, Greifenstein, Altenwörth, Ering-Frauenstein and Braunau-Simbach. Over the coming years, semi-natural bypasses will also be built at the power plants in Jochenstein and Egglfing,"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 269 and fish passes at all power plants on the Danube and Inn Rivers will allow fish to migrate to key habitats largely unhindered. Large island distributary systems have already been implemented downstream of the Ottensheim- Wilhering and Ering-Frauenstein power plants and are planned for further sites as part of LIFE projects. Measures for the de-sedimentation of silted-up-foodplains have already been implemented on the Inn and Danube rivers, and will be implemented in many more reservoirs over the coming years, starting at the Aschach and Jochenstein reservoirs. Research Several research projects are conducting scientific studies to explore sustainable, ecologically effective actions in river habitats over the course of several years. The aim is to enhance the value of the aquatic habitat while continuing to meet society’s high expectations when it comes to sustainable, economically viable hydropower generation. In the ÖkoResch project, for example, researchers from the BOKU University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences will be scientifically monitoring planned measures to limit hydropeaking and studying the effect of new residual water releases on aquatic habitats in alpine regions. Research will be conducted over the course of six years (2020–2026). The long duration of the project stems primarily from the necessary field work in the high-alpine habitat. These research activities are carried out in bodies of water affected by hydropeaking and semi-natural reference waters. Dotation tests are also being conducted at representative test sites. At VERBUND, the Hundskehlbach catchment is currently being investigated. Based on the analyses, an ecological assessment and monitoring system will be developed by the end of the project. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Sediment Research and Management (BOKU) is evaluating ecologically compatible options for sediment remobilisation. In addition, a new sensor method is being studied at the Gries power plant on the Salzach River to record the beginning and end of bedload transport during water lowering processes. The Christian Doppler Laboratory for Meta Ecosystem Dynamics in Riverine Landscapes (MERI) (BOKU) is analysing the long-term added value of selected LIFE projects on the Danube. The fish bypass project in partnership with Graz University of Technology and engineering offices that specialise in the environment is dedicated to the effects of transverse structures on the fish population, which are assessed in the laboratory and at the sites themselves. The project results will be published and presented at conferences in Germany and Austria in 2025. In collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, the migration behaviour and habitat use of selected fish species are being closely studied in the Inn River with the use of fish tagging based on PIT tags. PIT tag antennas were installed at a total of 25 sites, 12 of which were equipped with fish passes, to analyse the tagged fish. In collaboration with the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, the impacts of the restoration measures at the Ering-Frauenstein power plant were examined to determine the population dynamics of selected fish species. The project was completed in late 2023 with the findings subsequently presented and published in international publications in 2024. Terrestrial actions In the future, additional measures will be taken to promote biodiversity in the terrestrial ecosystems of green spaces owned by VERBUND.

Sections in the catalogue include background information, best practices and recommendations for action on topics such as mowing management, creating structures such as rock piles, deadwood elements, or hedges, forest management, commissioning services on VERBUND plots of land, planting and seeding, and the management of non- native and invasive species. The catalogue of measures was published and communicated internally by VERBUND in 2024 and is intended to raise environmental awareness among employees and to serve as a basis for sustainable management plans. The actions listed below with regard to terrestrial ecosystems are often part of larger projects, or recurring or continuous activities related to the upkeep, cultivation or management of land, which is why estimations cannot be provided for financial figures. The following actions have been taken in particular in relation to sustainable land-use practices, including forest management: In 2024, the forest area owned by VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH was certified as active, sustainable and climate-fit in accordance with the quality criteria of the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). PEFC Austria develops standards and procedures for the system used to certify the domestic forests and the entire downstream value chain. A tree cadastre was introduced in 2024 to allow trees to be preserved for longer so that the special potential of old trees, as habitat trees and carriers of microhabitats, can be utilised. Such microhabitats provide dedicated habitats for animal, plant, lichen and fungus species. Woodpecker and detritus cavities and hollows in these old trees along with exposed wood and deadwood also provide a diverse range of food and habitat for various species. Road safety assessments in accordance with ÖNORM L1122 in conjunction with ÖNORM L1125 (tree cadastre) are required to maintain these valuable habitat trees in areas frequented by the public or by operating personnel. The Altenwörth and Greifenstein power plants are located in the Tullnerfelder-Donau-Auen Natura 2000 area. VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH and other landowners participated in the project “Development of an inter-company forest biodiversity monitoring and management concept for maintaining and promoting biodiversity in the Tullnerfelder-Donau-Auen Natura 2000 area” (WAMO). All surveys (inventory sampling, mapping of forest biodiversity elements, faunistic surveys, including bird species surveys) were carried out and completed in 2024. The final report will be published in 2025. Timber harvesting has largely been switched to modern felling and extraction techniques where possible in recent years. Particular care is taken when introducing rejuvenation measures to ensure that the trees to be removed are intentionally felled to protect saplings. Felling work is carried out with harvesters where possible only under suitable soil conditions (dry or frozen). When used with care, harvesters can reduce soil contamination and protect fauna and flora. VERBUND leases grasslands to farms as well and often sets out criteria in leases, including bans on fertilising and spraying for semi-natural, biodiversity-enhancing land management. Information on the types of land use and related intensity along with ecological cultivation is obtained from Agrarmarkt Austria and, subject to consent being granted by leaseholders, is transmitted to VERBUND to obtain an overview of the land use. Extensive cultivation is intended not only to avoid the introduction of herbicides and fertilisers along with the associated loss of species, but also to contribute to soil protection through reduced driving on the land and thereby reduce the load placed on the soil by agricultural equipment. In green spaces located close to bodies of water, the biodiversity of plants and animals (such as rare orchids, herbs, wild bees, lizards, grasshoppers, butterflies and spiders) is promoted through responsible meadow management and ecological maintenance measures.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 271 setting up environmentally optimised dam maintenance at the power plants in Egglfing-Obernberg, Ering-Frauenstein and Braunau-Simbach in Bavaria. To minimise potential negative impacts of wind turbines on populations and habitats, independent environmental agencies and the related authorities have prescribed a range of actions to be taken as part of environmental assessments. For one, many sites require periodic monitoring of bird and bat populations, often in conjunction with related adjustments to operations and temporary plant shutdowns for certain observed species or specified circumstances, such as the harvest period for cornfields. Environmental compensation areas are also being set up for birds of prey, owls, and other birds at certain sites, including Mariengarten and Göttlesbrunn, to provide substitute habitats that are extensively cultivated or planted with forage crops at a suitable distance from wind turbines. Sections of the land may be mowed on a rare or partial basis to ensure cover is maintained for small mammals, deer and ground nesting species. Another area in the green space is kept mown to provide a biotope where birds of prey can hunt. In order to promote biodiversity, (mineral) fertilisers and pesticides are not permitted in these compensation areas. Following the construction phase of new wind farms, temporary access routes and crane parking spaces are reduced to a minimum and restored to their original condition. Other measures related to wind farms include replacement or reforestation of prescribed tree species, as well as the protection and developmental upkeep of trees and shrubs. Action plans have been established for open-field solar installations in Austria and Spain, both for the construction phase and for the operation of the installations. These related measures may be one-off or recurring, and follow the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy. For instance, to prevent negative impacts on biodiversity, construction times and any necessary clearing work are adapted to the breeding behaviour of native species, as is the case at the installations in Mitterkirchen and Ludmannsdorf. Valuable habitats are not touched during construction or, where this is not possible, restored after construction. Permeable fences are also built to facilitate the unhindered passage of wild animals, for example at the La Solana installation in Spain. Restoration measures taken after the construction of installations include replanting native plants affected by the construction work. Compensatory measures can include the establishment of insect hotels, wildflower strips on the edge of the installation, or planting new trees and shrubs on the installation land to create additional habitats. In Austria, care is also taken to ensure extensive land cultivation without fertilisation and with the removal of mowed grass clippings. As part of mowing management, attention is paid to ensuring that animals such as partridges remain protected by visual cover and to the management of non-native and invasive species. An example of this approach can be found at the photovoltaic installation in Güssing, which opened in 2024. Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH also take measures to maintain and promote biodiversity and base their actions on the mitigation hierarchy as a matter of course. This helps to both minimise the environmental impacts in relation to the grid and avoid unnecessary environmental impacts from the outset. In addition to statutory requirements, special consideration is given to species protection in projects undertaken by Gas Connect Austria GmbH. As part of its sustainable habitat management, Austrian Power Grid AG has a long history of implementing environmental and species protection measures in relation to the power grid that go far beyond the stringent legal requirements. The Gas Connect Austria GmbH gas network and the Austrian Power Grid AG electricity grid lead through various landscape areas in Austria. Depending on the region, the climate, the naturally occurring circumstances and the type of use by humans, Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH routes pass through various landscapes, including forests, grasslands and farmland. The route corridors not only contain the power lines and pipelines, but also provide valuable habitats for flora and fauna."

"272 When planning the construction of new gas pipelines and high-voltage power lines, the aim is always to plan the route such that it avoids sensitive areas (nature reserves, bird sanctuaries, biotopes, natural and archaeological monuments, etc.). If this is not possible, nature conservation experts are consulted to determine whether interfering with nature can be avoided to the greatest possible extent. At Gas Connect Austria GmbH, biodiversity measures include ecological site supervision, compliance with guidelines for proper soil recultivation, reforestation, regulatory monitoring, management of non- native and invasive species, relocation of protected species and wildlife corridors. At Austrian Power Grid AG, for example, CEF measures have been introduced to ensure the continuous ecological functionality of the habitats in which the wood grouse is found. In addition, numerous amphibian spawning grounds along with nesting areas and woodpiles have been established to compensate for encroaching on the terrestrial ecosystem. Bird conservation is of particular importance for Austrian Power Grid AG. When constructing overhead line systems, special care is taken to observe the breeding periods of rare species along with other measures. Numerous nesting aids for endangered bird species have been installed on electricity pylons and around lines. For example, if the habitat of gophers is affected during line construction, they are temporarily resettled for the duration of the construction work until their habitat is restored. Nature and species protection experts as well as local residents contribute their experience in resettling the gophers. Compensatory measures and spaces are defined in the planning phase and are legally secured through land purchases or long-term lease agreements. Current biodiversity measures in connection with construction projects are reported for Austrian Power Grid AG in the year during which new installations are put into initial operation. Every year, experts from various specialist fields are invited to participate in the Austrian Power Grid AG nature conservation meeting to share their experiences, engage in scientific debate and talk to stakeholders. VERBUND has been implementing a wide range of decarbonisation measures and is indirectly working to mitigate biodiversity loss by expanding renewable energy generation and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Please consult section E1 Climate change for more information. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E4-4 – Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems VERBUND has set itself the goal of investing around €400m between 2002 and 2027 in environmental measures such as constructing fish passes and restoring stretches of rivers. By the end of 2024, €194m had already been allocated to corresponding measures, as described in the previous section. Of the 92 installations required to ensure fish passage at present, 71 had achieved fish passability by the end of 2024. In base year 2021, upon the launch of the third National River Basin Management Plan in Austria, this figure stood at 66. By 2027, 89 installations are expected to be passable, subject to the timely receipt of the required public permits. Both corporate targets include VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH, Grenzkraftwerke GmbH and VERBUND Innkraftwerke GmbH as well as Ennskraftwerke AG. They primarily address the impacts of hydropower on the river ecosystem, particularly on the historically altered river morphology, the barrier function, and the associated impacts on the development of the fish population. The targets cover the catchment areas of the Danube, Drau, Salzach, Enns, Mur and Inn rivers in Austria and Bavaria. These targets have been allocated to the restoration step of the mitigation hierarchy. Restoring the passability of major rivers is one of the objectives set out in the European Water Framework Directive. This Directive was enshrined in Austrian law by the Third National River Basin"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 273 Management Plan in 2021 and in Germany by the coordinated management plan (2022–2027). Among other things, the plans specify which stretches of river are to be morphologically restored to achieve good ecological condition or good ecological potential of the surface water bodies, and where measures for passability and residual water discharges need to be implemented. The international and national requirements are based on ecological thresholds for river basins. VERBUND uses these findings to improve its knowledge and contributes to the sustainable use and improvement of bodies of water through its targets and actions. In addition, VERBUND targets are linked to the restoration of freshwater ecosystems objective set in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Fish and all organisms found in and around the water habitat benefit from fish passes and the many bypass channels around them. Ecological thresholds for monitoring the functionality of fish passes are set forth by the responsible federal ministry in the form of guidelines. The functionality of fish passes and compliance with the requirements must be verified by VERBUND in the context of monitoring and corresponding reports. In Bavaria, the Technical University of Munich carries out comprehensive functionality monitoring in coordination with the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection. If compensation measures are required in relation to the implementation of semi-natural projects (e.g. for clearing work to reconnect silted distributaries), these are ordered by the authorities and executed alongside project implementation. However, these measures are not subject to any set targets. Sustainability commitments have been developed for wind and photovoltaics, including biodiversity commitments. Through these commitments, VERBUND aims to achieve biodiversity net gains by 2030 for wind and photovoltaic projects. Specific targets for biodiversity net gains in the construction and operation of installations are currently being developed on the basis of these commitments. These targets include the development of comprehensive biodiversity concepts for wind farms and open-field solar installations. The aim is to not only minimise the negative impacts of infrastructure projects on the environment, but also to actively contribute to promoting biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats. For further business areas, compliance with policies and the implementation of measures related to biodiversity will be ensured through environmental management systems, annually updated action plans, monitoring requirements and the schedule of legal provisions, as well as through external certifications. These plans concern one-off, ongoing measures to be implemented at defined intervals. Progress of the measures is documented at least once a year. Disclosure Requirement E4-5 – Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change At VERBUND, 128 sites with a potential negative impact on protected areas are located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas (see table for E4 SBM 3). Of this amount, 6,242 hectares comprise land that is either owned by VERBUND or which is under third-party ownership with easements (servitude) for VERBUND. The number of fish passes completed is used as a metric for determining changes in the passability of rivers. As of the end of 2024, a total of 71 VERBUND power plant sites, including Ennskraftwerke AG, were passable for fish. This corresponds to 76% of the run-of-river power plants. Plans for a further eleven run- of-river power plants are already in the advanced stage, and completion is planned for 2025 and 2026. Construction of the fish passes at the Rosenheim power plant (Inn River), the Laufnitzdorf and Bodendorf power plants (Mur River), as well as the Landl (Enns River) and Sölk power plants (Donnersbach River) is scheduled to begin in 2025.

All surveys (inventory sampling, mapping of forest biodiversity elements, faunistic surveys, including bird species surveys) were carried out and completed in 2024. The final report will be published in 2025. Timber harvesting has largely been switched to modern felling and extraction techniques where possible in recent years. Particular care is taken when introducing rejuvenation measures to ensure that the trees to be removed are intentionally felled to protect saplings. Felling work is carried out with harvesters where possible only under suitable soil conditions (dry or frozen). When used with care, harvesters can reduce soil contamination and protect fauna and flora. VERBUND leases grasslands to farms as well and often sets out criteria in leases, including bans on fertilising and spraying for semi-natural, biodiversity-enhancing land management. Information on the types of land use and related intensity along with ecological cultivation is obtained from Agrarmarkt Austria and, subject to consent being granted by leaseholders, is transmitted to VERBUND to obtain an overview of the land use. Extensive cultivation is intended not only to avoid the introduction of herbicides and fertilisers along with the associated loss of species, but also to contribute to soil protection through reduced driving on the land and thereby reduce the load placed on the soil by agricultural equipment. In green spaces located close to bodies of water, the biodiversity of plants and animals (such as rare orchids, herbs, wild bees, lizards, grasshoppers, butterflies and spiders) is promoted through responsible meadow management and ecological maintenance measures. VERBUND is currently in the process of"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 271 setting up environmentally optimised dam maintenance at the power plants in Egglfing-Obernberg, Ering-Frauenstein and Braunau-Simbach in Bavaria. To minimise potential negative impacts of wind turbines on populations and habitats, independent environmental agencies and the related authorities have prescribed a range of actions to be taken as part of environmental assessments. For one, many sites require periodic monitoring of bird and bat populations, often in conjunction with related adjustments to operations and temporary plant shutdowns for certain observed species or specified circumstances, such as the harvest period for cornfields. Environmental compensation areas are also being set up for birds of prey, owls, and other birds at certain sites, including Mariengarten and Göttlesbrunn, to provide substitute habitats that are extensively cultivated or planted with forage crops at a suitable distance from wind turbines. Sections of the land may be mowed on a rare or partial basis to ensure cover is maintained for small mammals, deer and ground nesting species. Another area in the green space is kept mown to provide a biotope where birds of prey can hunt. In order to promote biodiversity, (mineral) fertilisers and pesticides are not permitted in these compensation areas. Following the construction phase of new wind farms, temporary access routes and crane parking spaces are reduced to a minimum and restored to their original condition. Other measures related to wind farms include replacement or reforestation of prescribed tree species, as well as the protection and developmental upkeep of trees and shrubs. Action plans have been established for open-field solar installations in Austria and Spain, both for the construction phase and for the operation of the installations. These related measures may be one-off or recurring, and follow the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy. For instance, to prevent negative impacts on biodiversity, construction times and any necessary clearing work are adapted to the breeding behaviour of native species, as is the case at the installations in Mitterkirchen and Ludmannsdorf. Valuable habitats are not touched during construction or, where this is not possible, restored after construction. Permeable fences are also built to facilitate the unhindered passage of wild animals, for example at the La Solana installation in Spain. Restoration measures taken after the construction of installations include replanting native plants affected by the construction work. Compensatory measures can include the establishment of insect hotels, wildflower strips on the edge of the installation, or planting new trees and shrubs on the installation land to create additional habitats. In Austria, care is also taken to ensure extensive land cultivation without fertilisation and with the removal of mowed grass clippings. As part of mowing management, attention is paid to ensuring that animals such as partridges remain protected by visual cover and to the management of non-native and invasive species. An example of this approach can be found at the photovoltaic installation in Güssing, which opened in 2024. Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH also take measures to maintain and promote biodiversity and base their actions on the mitigation hierarchy as a matter of course. This helps to both minimise the environmental impacts in relation to the grid and avoid unnecessary environmental impacts from the outset. In addition to statutory requirements, special consideration is given to species protection in projects undertaken by Gas Connect Austria GmbH. As part of its sustainable habitat management, Austrian Power Grid AG has a long history of implementing environmental and species protection measures in relation to the power grid that go far beyond the stringent legal requirements. The Gas Connect Austria GmbH gas network and the Austrian Power Grid AG electricity grid lead through various landscape areas in Austria. Depending on the region, the climate, the naturally occurring circumstances and the type of use by humans, Austrian Power Grid AG and Gas Connect Austria GmbH routes pass through various landscapes, including forests, grasslands and farmland. The route corridors not only contain the power lines and pipelines, but also provide valuable habitats for flora and fauna."
"272 When planning the construction of new gas pipelines and high-voltage power lines, the aim is always to plan the route such that it avoids sensitive areas (nature reserves, bird sanctuaries, biotopes, natural and archaeological monuments, etc.). If this is not possible, nature conservation experts are consulted to determine whether interfering with nature can be avoided to the greatest possible extent. At Gas Connect Austria GmbH, biodiversity measures include ecological site supervision, compliance with guidelines for proper soil recultivation, reforestation, regulatory monitoring, management of non- native and invasive species, relocation of protected species and wildlife corridors. At Austrian Power Grid AG, for example, CEF measures have been introduced to ensure the continuous ecological functionality of the habitats in which the wood grouse is found. In addition, numerous amphibian spawning grounds along with nesting areas and woodpiles have been established to compensate for encroaching on the terrestrial ecosystem. Bird conservation is of particular importance for Austrian Power Grid AG. When constructing overhead line systems, special care is taken to observe the breeding periods of rare species along with other measures. Numerous nesting aids for endangered bird species have been installed on electricity pylons and around lines. For example, if the habitat of gophers is affected during line construction, they are temporarily resettled for the duration of the construction work until their habitat is restored. Nature and species protection experts as well as local residents contribute their experience in resettling the gophers. Compensatory measures and spaces are defined in the planning phase and are legally secured through land purchases or long-term lease agreements. Current biodiversity measures in connection with construction projects are reported for Austrian Power Grid AG in the year during which new installations are put into initial operation. Every year, experts from various specialist fields are invited to participate in the Austrian Power Grid AG nature conservation meeting to share their experiences, engage in scientific debate and talk to stakeholders. VERBUND has been implementing a wide range of decarbonisation measures and is indirectly working to mitigate biodiversity loss by expanding renewable energy generation and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. Please consult section E1 Climate change for more information. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E4-4 – Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems VERBUND has set itself the goal of investing around €400m between 2002 and 2027 in environmental measures such as constructing fish passes and restoring stretches of rivers. By the end of 2024, €194m had already been allocated to corresponding measures, as described in the previous section. Of the 92 installations required to ensure fish passage at present, 71 had achieved fish passability by the end of 2024. In base year 2021, upon the launch of the third National River Basin Management Plan in Austria, this figure stood at 66. By 2027, 89 installations are expected to be passable, subject to the timely receipt of the required public permits. Both corporate targets include VERBUND Hydro Power GmbH, Grenzkraftwerke GmbH and VERBUND Innkraftwerke GmbH as well as Ennskraftwerke AG. They primarily address the impacts of hydropower on the river ecosystem, particularly on the historically altered river morphology, the barrier function, and the associated impacts on the development of the fish population. The targets cover the catchment areas of the Danube, Drau, Salzach, Enns, Mur and Inn rivers in Austria and Bavaria. These targets have been allocated to the restoration step of the mitigation hierarchy.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 273 Management Plan in 2021 and in Germany by the coordinated management plan (2022–2027). Among other things, the plans specify which stretches of river are to be morphologically restored to achieve good ecological condition or good ecological potential of the surface water bodies, and where measures for passability and residual water discharges need to be implemented. The international and national requirements are based on ecological thresholds for river basins. VERBUND uses these findings to improve its knowledge and contributes to the sustainable use and improvement of bodies of water through its targets and actions. In addition, VERBUND targets are linked to the restoration of freshwater ecosystems objective set in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Fish and all organisms found in and around the water habitat benefit from fish passes and the many bypass channels around them. Ecological thresholds for monitoring the functionality of fish passes are set forth by the responsible federal ministry in the form of guidelines. The functionality of fish passes and compliance with the requirements must be verified by VERBUND in the context of monitoring and corresponding reports. In Bavaria, the Technical University of Munich carries out comprehensive functionality monitoring in coordination with the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection. If compensation measures are required in relation to the implementation of semi-natural projects (e.g. for clearing work to reconnect silted distributaries), these are ordered by the authorities and executed alongside project implementation. However, these measures are not subject to any set targets. Sustainability commitments have been developed for wind and photovoltaics, including biodiversity commitments. Through these commitments, VERBUND aims to achieve biodiversity net gains by 2030 for wind and photovoltaic projects. Specific targets for biodiversity net gains in the construction and operation of installations are currently being developed on the basis of these commitments. These targets include the development of comprehensive biodiversity concepts for wind farms and open-field solar installations. The aim is to not only minimise the negative impacts of infrastructure projects on the environment, but also to actively contribute to promoting biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats. For further business areas, compliance with policies and the implementation of measures related to biodiversity will be ensured through environmental management systems, annually updated action plans, monitoring requirements and the schedule of legal provisions, as well as through external certifications. These plans concern one-off, ongoing measures to be implemented at defined intervals. Progress of the measures is documented at least once a year. Disclosure Requirement E4-5 – Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change At VERBUND, 128 sites with a potential negative impact on protected areas are located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas (see table for E4 SBM 3). Of this amount, 6,242 hectares comprise land that is either owned by VERBUND or which is under third-party ownership with easements (servitude) for VERBUND. The number of fish passes completed is used as a metric for determining changes in the passability of rivers. As of the end of 2024, a total of 71 VERBUND power plant sites, including Ennskraftwerke AG, were passable for fish. This corresponds to 76% of the run-of-river power plants. Plans for a further eleven run- of-river power plants are already in the advanced stage, and completion is planned for 2025 and 2026. Construction of the fish passes at the Rosenheim power plant (Inn River), the Laufnitzdorf and Bodendorf power plants (Mur River), as well as the Landl (Enns River) and Sölk power plants (Donnersbach River) is scheduled to begin in 2025.

Compensation, offsetting and substitute measures as well as ensuring environmental continuity are the most common measures. The majority of wind turbines are monitored on an annual basis. While bird and bat populations are usually checked, plant species and native animal species are also frequently monitored. ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy ESRS 2 General Disclosures VERBUND recognises the need to implement a fully functional circular economy at national and international level without delay. Accordingly, VERBUND strives to expand on measures implemented to date on the topics of resource efficiency and circular economy and to identify further relevant topics. VERBUND wants to contribute to a successful circular economy. Measures already implemented include, for example, the utilisation of by-products from thermal energy generation as well as comprehensive maintenance programmes for VERBUND facilities. These initiatives are aimed at extending the service life of VERBUND facilities, reducing the use of raw materials and minimising the generation of waste in the long term. Impact, risk and opportunity management The provision of electricity requires the construction and maintenance of various types of power plants along with the necessary related infrastructure. For this reason, both resource inflows and waste were categorised as material topics. More information on the assessment methodology applied in the double materiality assessment and on how affected communities were involved in the process is described in the section ESRS 2 IRO-1.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 275 Disclosure Requirement E5-1 – Policies related to resource use and circular economy At VERBUND, the management of impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy is of importance when it comes to keeping primary resource consumption to a minimum while maximising the circularity of waste streams. A comprehensive Group-wide approach to conserving resources and the circular economy is yet to be established as the related direct impacts on the environment are considered to be low compared to the other environmental topics. However, VERBUND has launched an analysis process to evaluate the aspects of the circular economy relevant to the Group. The aim is to develop a circular economy strategy that generates both environmental and economic benefits for society and for VERBUND. The VERBUND Executive Board has already adopted and regularly updates executive orders that define responsibilities and areas of responsibility in relation to materials management and sustainability management within the Group. The following ecological criteria have been established to support the transition to a circular economy at VERBUND: Responsible use of natural raw materials and resources. VERBUND records the proportion of renewable energy sources in its total energy consumption and monitors the development of energy consumption and materials on an annual basis. Waste management represents another important topic. VERBUND is committed to ensuring the prevention, recovery, reuse, and proper collection and treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. As a result, all waste is handed over for appropriate recovery or disposal. VERBUND is focused on optimising its existing operational processes and efficiently reducing waste streams. Following the coal phase-out, the volume of waste generated has been on the decline. However, greater waste streams are expected in the long term due to recent photovoltaic and wind installations. Waste management at VERBUND follows the principles of the European Union’s five-step waste hierarchy: waste prevention before preparation for reuse, before recycling, before recovery and before disposal. The VERBUND Group Waste Coordinator and their deputy monitor waste management and provide advice based on the VERBUND Waste Management work instruction. The Group waste coordinators are responsible for administration and knowledge management with regard to waste management at VERBUND. They review the appointment of waste officers and their deputies on an annual basis, assist with submitting reports to the authorities, update work instructions, identify training needs, organise trainings and hold coordination meetings. Responsibility for compliance with the legal requirements rests with the respective managers. Procurement takes place in accordance with the specially defined executive order for materials management and the VERBUND procurement guidelines, which stipulate that materials management must be carried out in accordance with the business principles and with due regard to the corporate mission statement, the corporate objectives and sustainability. Accordingly, economic, environmental and social criteria must be taken into account in award decisions, both for procurement and for sales. In addition to the executive orders, a Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has been established for the management of resource inflows to ensure resource-efficient waste and materials management at VERBUND and all subsidiaries. Resource inflows related to procurement are subject to this Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). Among other things, the Group-wide SCoC provides recommendations for VERBUND contractors on resource use and circular economy.

These targets include the development of comprehensive biodiversity concepts for wind farms and open-field solar installations. The aim is to not only minimise the negative impacts of infrastructure projects on the environment, but also to actively contribute to promoting biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats. For further business areas, compliance with policies and the implementation of measures related to biodiversity will be ensured through environmental management systems, annually updated action plans, monitoring requirements and the schedule of legal provisions, as well as through external certifications. These plans concern one-off, ongoing measures to be implemented at defined intervals. Progress of the measures is documented at least once a year. Disclosure Requirement E4-5 – Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change At VERBUND, 128 sites with a potential negative impact on protected areas are located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas (see table for E4 SBM 3). Of this amount, 6,242 hectares comprise land that is either owned by VERBUND or which is under third-party ownership with easements (servitude) for VERBUND. The number of fish passes completed is used as a metric for determining changes in the passability of rivers. As of the end of 2024, a total of 71 VERBUND power plant sites, including Ennskraftwerke AG, were passable for fish. This corresponds to 76% of the run-of-river power plants. Plans for a further eleven run- of-river power plants are already in the advanced stage, and completion is planned for 2025 and 2026. Construction of the fish passes at the Rosenheim power plant (Inn River), the Laufnitzdorf and Bodendorf power plants (Mur River), as well as the Landl (Enns River) and Sölk power plants (Donnersbach River) is scheduled to begin in 2025. The metric “Number of fish passes” covers both the restoration of the"

In order to check the functionality of fish passes, fish monitoring is carried out upon completion of newly built passes. Fish passes Base year Comparison (N-1) (N) 2021 2023 2024 Sites Number 66 69 71 More than 80% of VERBUND wind turbines and all open-field solar installations throughout Europe are already accompanied by environmental measures during construction and operation. Compensation, offsetting and substitute measures as well as ensuring environmental continuity are the most common measures. The majority of wind turbines are monitored on an annual basis. While bird and bat populations are usually checked, plant species and native animal species are also frequently monitored. ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy ESRS 2 General Disclosures VERBUND recognises the need to implement a fully functional circular economy at national and international level without delay. Accordingly, VERBUND strives to expand on measures implemented to date on the topics of resource efficiency and circular economy and to identify further relevant topics. VERBUND wants to contribute to a successful circular economy. Measures already implemented include, for example, the utilisation of by-products from thermal energy generation as well as comprehensive maintenance programmes for VERBUND facilities. These initiatives are aimed at extending the service life of VERBUND facilities, reducing the use of raw materials and minimising the generation of waste in the long term. Impact, risk and opportunity management The provision of electricity requires the construction and maintenance of various types of power plants along with the necessary related infrastructure. For this reason, both resource inflows and waste were categorised as material topics. More information on the assessment methodology applied in the double materiality assessment and on how affected communities were involved in the process is described in the section ESRS 2 IRO-1. The following sections discuss the approaches to managing identified opportunities and risks, allocated actions and resources, and related key metrics and targets. Disclosure Requirement related to ESRS 2 IRO-1 – Description of the processes to identify and assess material resource use and circular economy-related impacts, risks and opportunities Topic-specific disclosures on processes to identify and assess material resource use and circular economy-related impacts, risks and opportunities can be found in the section ESRS 2 IRO-1."
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 275 Disclosure Requirement E5-1 – Policies related to resource use and circular economy At VERBUND, the management of impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy is of importance when it comes to keeping primary resource consumption to a minimum while maximising the circularity of waste streams. A comprehensive Group-wide approach to conserving resources and the circular economy is yet to be established as the related direct impacts on the environment are considered to be low compared to the other environmental topics. However, VERBUND has launched an analysis process to evaluate the aspects of the circular economy relevant to the Group. The aim is to develop a circular economy strategy that generates both environmental and economic benefits for society and for VERBUND. The VERBUND Executive Board has already adopted and regularly updates executive orders that define responsibilities and areas of responsibility in relation to materials management and sustainability management within the Group. The following ecological criteria have been established to support the transition to a circular economy at VERBUND: Responsible use of natural raw materials and resources. VERBUND records the proportion of renewable energy sources in its total energy consumption and monitors the development of energy consumption and materials on an annual basis. Waste management represents another important topic. VERBUND is committed to ensuring the prevention, recovery, reuse, and proper collection and treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. As a result, all waste is handed over for appropriate recovery or disposal. VERBUND is focused on optimising its existing operational processes and efficiently reducing waste streams. Following the coal phase-out, the volume of waste generated has been on the decline. However, greater waste streams are expected in the long term due to recent photovoltaic and wind installations. Waste management at VERBUND follows the principles of the European Union’s five-step waste hierarchy: waste prevention before preparation for reuse, before recycling, before recovery and before disposal. The VERBUND Group Waste Coordinator and their deputy monitor waste management and provide advice based on the VERBUND Waste Management work instruction. The Group waste coordinators are responsible for administration and knowledge management with regard to waste management at VERBUND. They review the appointment of waste officers and their deputies on an annual basis, assist with submitting reports to the authorities, update work instructions, identify training needs, organise trainings and hold coordination meetings. Responsibility for compliance with the legal requirements rests with the respective managers. Procurement takes place in accordance with the specially defined executive order for materials management and the VERBUND procurement guidelines, which stipulate that materials management must be carried out in accordance with the business principles and with due regard to the corporate mission statement, the corporate objectives and sustainability. Accordingly, economic, environmental and social criteria must be taken into account in award decisions, both for procurement and for sales. In addition to the executive orders, a Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC) has been established for the management of resource inflows to ensure resource-efficient waste and materials management at VERBUND and all subsidiaries. Resource inflows related to procurement are subject to this Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). Among other things, the Group-wide SCoC provides recommendations for VERBUND contractors on resource use and circular economy. The SCoC applies to all suppliers and business partners that supply products or services to the Group, including both domestic and"
"276 international suppliers. Suppliers in business relationships with VERBUND must adhere to the standards and expectations set out therein. In order to improve energy and resource efficiency, VERBUND suppliers are advised to implement measures that significantly reduce the use thereof. These recommendations are listed in the SCoC, are available to all suppliers, and form part of VERBUND’s general terms and conditions for orders. VERBUND also encourages its suppliers to minimise and continuously reduce the production and use of microplastics. Furthermore, VERBUND recommends the active promotion of a circular economy in order to support the reuse and recycling of materials. The waste hierarchy of prevent, reuse, recycle, recover, dispose must be upheld with regard to waste management. In this way, it can be ensured that any waste generated is properly disposed of. With these recommendations for action, VERBUND aims to help create the conditions for resource- efficient and sustainable management. The full SCoC is available online and a more detailed description can be found in the ESRS G1 section of this report. Stakeholders were accounted for when the above policies were drawn up through various dialogue platforms, as described in more detail in ESRS 2 SBM-2. Disclosure Requirement E5-2 – Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy The topic of resource flows related to resource use and circular economy (ESRS E5) was categorised as material in the double materiality assessment. VERBUND is working on identifying measures to improve resource use and circular economy. This involves a comprehensive analysis of existing practices and obtaining feedback from various departments and companies throughout the Group. By incorporating the perspectives of its employees and partners, VERBUND hopes to gain valuable insights that will enable it to expand and optimise its measures in a targeted manner. The measures listed below are not one-off measures but instead recurring measures that form part of ongoing business processes for which it is not possible to make any estimates with regard to financial figures. VERBUND is committed to reducing waste and to preventing waste wherever possible. The Group consistently separates waste. In addition, the valid “Occupational safety and environmental guideline on the provision of services by contractors at VERBUND sites and/or construction sites in Austria” and the “Occupational safety and environmental guideline on the provision of services by contractors at VERBUND sites and/or construction sites in Germany”, require contractors in Austria and Germany to diligently implement the applicable provisions relating to the dismantling and separation of waste. Through these ongoing measures, VERBUND actively contributes to the conservation of resources and environmental compatibility of its construction and demolition projects. This directive is part of VERBUND’s General Terms and Conditions. At VERBUND, activities related to waste management are structured according to the EU waste hierarchy: waste prevention, followed by preparation for reuse, recycling, and energy or material recovery. Any remaining non-hazardous as well as hazardous waste is sent exclusively to authorised waste collection and treatment firms. By consistently implementing this hierarchy, VERBUND ensures that waste is prevented at the earliest possible stage and, where this is not possible, is considered a valuable"
"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 273 Management Plan in 2021 and in Germany by the coordinated management plan (2022–2027). Among other things, the plans specify which stretches of river are to be morphologically restored to achieve good ecological condition or good ecological potential of the surface water bodies, and where measures for passability and residual water discharges need to be implemented. The international and national requirements are based on ecological thresholds for river basins. VERBUND uses these findings to improve its knowledge and contributes to the sustainable use and improvement of bodies of water through its targets and actions. In addition, VERBUND targets are linked to the restoration of freshwater ecosystems objective set in the EU Biodiversity Strategy. Fish and all organisms found in and around the water habitat benefit from fish passes and the many bypass channels around them. Ecological thresholds for monitoring the functionality of fish passes are set forth by the responsible federal ministry in the form of guidelines. The functionality of fish passes and compliance with the requirements must be verified by VERBUND in the context of monitoring and corresponding reports. In Bavaria, the Technical University of Munich carries out comprehensive functionality monitoring in coordination with the Bavarian State Ministry of the Environment and Consumer Protection. If compensation measures are required in relation to the implementation of semi-natural projects (e.g. for clearing work to reconnect silted distributaries), these are ordered by the authorities and executed alongside project implementation. However, these measures are not subject to any set targets. Sustainability commitments have been developed for wind and photovoltaics, including biodiversity commitments. Through these commitments, VERBUND aims to achieve biodiversity net gains by 2030 for wind and photovoltaic projects. Specific targets for biodiversity net gains in the construction and operation of installations are currently being developed on the basis of these commitments.

"INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Group management report 277 resource through reuse or recycling. This not only reduces the volume of waste, but also promotes environmentally friendly and resource-efficient operations management. Waste prevention is a key pillar of VERBUND’s operating practices. Annual waste generation from demolition work is kept low through the use of durable building materials, the long-term use of installations in operation, and repair policies designed to maximise the useful life of installations. Due to the phase-out of thermal power generation using coal products in 2020, annual volumes of lime sludge material flows as by-products of thermal generation are on the decline. The remaining quantities are used as additives in the cement industry. The aim of elongating the useful life of operated facilities and thereby saving materials for new construction is pursued through ongoing maintenance measures and optimised service intervals for wind farms and photovoltaic installations. One measure that has already been implemented is the utilisation of the press filter cake from the cooling tower makeup water treatment system at the Mellach gas power plant. The by-product, namely sludge from the cooling tower makeup water treatment system, was converted into raw meal as part of the cement production process. Recovery measures such as these help to preserve natural resources. The resulting material flow accounts for only a fraction of the material streams of coarse ash, fly ash and gypsum generated prior to 2020. The phase-out of coal-fired power generation completely eliminated these material streams. A waste recovery project was launched at the end of 2023. At a former power plant site, soda ash, which was previously generated as a result of coal combustion with subsequent flue gas desulphurisation and temporarily stored on a landfill belonging to the site, is now treated and used as an additive at a cement plant. Thanks to this ongoing measure, the material properties of the soda ash are being put to good use while simultaneously saving natural raw materials in the cement industry. Waste generated on an annual basis is collected and treated by several service providers, and the waste streams can be roughly divided into different categories. In light of the current legislative environment and lack of transparency on the part of waste collection and treatment firms, it is not possible to provide information on the final recovery of waste broken down into thermal and material recovery. Figures are being recorded on the total amount of waste sent for recovery and the amount of waste that is disposed of. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E5-3 – Targets related to resource use and circular economy At this point in time, VERBUND does not yet have any quantifiable targets in relation to resource use and circular economy as the Group is currently undertaking a comprehensive analysis and strategic planning on these topics. VERBUND is examining the possibility of formulating measurable and quantifiable targets in the course of developing its circular economy strategy. In order to measure the effectiveness of the policies and actions listed, VERBUND reviews the development of resource inflow volumes on an annual basis, broken down according to the most important technical materials and raw materials, and records the generated waste volumes with the help of its central sustainability data management tool. The evaluation of the resource inflows for the financial year 2024 will be carried out for the first time using the structure outlined in this report and subsequently used as a base year for future comparisons. Since 2018, year-on-year comparisons for data on waste have been recorded and analysed electronically. This approach helps VERBUND to adhere to the legally required waste documentation in accordance with, for example, Section 17 of the 2002 Austrian Waste"
