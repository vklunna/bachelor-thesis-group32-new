The baseline year for these targets is 2020 and the baseline value is indicated in the table above. Each year, annual emission targets are set and tracked on a monthly basis. Annual targets are aligned with the reduction pathway validated by SBTi. The decarbonisation programme at Żabka Polska has set governance processes, including monthly meetings. Oversight of the programme as well as decision making is entrusted to the Steering Committee. The operational teams carry out decarbonisation projects and initiatives and the Operational Committee provides monthly feedback from the field. A monthly system to monitor, report and validate GHG emissions data has also been developed, led by the ESG Reporting Lead and a team of controllers.

The data is reported in Mega-Watt-hours (MWh), and calculated based on energy metres and invoices received from suppliers that have been issued in the nominal units for each type of energy. To convert them into MWh, the calorific value rates provided by DEFRA for a given year were used. We followed the calculation guidance in the ESRS (Disclosure Requirement E1-5). In particular, we report here energy consumed from processes owned or controlled by us, applying the same perimeter applied for reporting GHG scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. All quantitative energy-related information is reported as final energy consumption, referring to the amount of energy that we actually consumed. Also in line with ESRS, we avoided double counting fuel consumption when disclosing self-generated energy consumption (when we generated electricity from either a non-renewable or renewable fuel source and then consumed the electricity generated, the energy consumption was counted only once under fuel consumption). 95 2024 Annual Report C.1. 2024 ESG highlights C.2.

In addition, Żabka Group has conducted its first carbon footprint calculation for the other entities. The GHG emissions for them are estimated to be 410,599 tCO2e. We are committed to continuously improving our calculation methods to ensure accuracy and completeness. Scope 1 GHG emissions are direct emissions from fuel combustion in distribution centres and emissions related to the fleet and refrigerants. When calculating GHG emissions for fuels, the emission factors used were obtained from the DEFRA database (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, UK). For GHG emissions related to refrigerants, the GWP coefficients were derived from the DEFRA database or data sheets for specific refrigerants. Scope 2 GHG emissions are indirect emissions from electricity and heat consumption by distribution centres and company headquarters. For the calculation of GHG emissions for electricity, data from The National Centre for Emissions Management (KOBiZE) modified by DEFRA were used for both location- and market-based methods. For the GHG emissions related to purchased grid heat, the emission factors were obtained from the DEFRA database. The difference between location-based and market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions is driven by the consideration of certification of origins. Scope 3 GHG emissions (which include upstream and downstream GHG emissions):: Scope 3 (upstream): GHG emissions related to purchased services, capital goods, fuel-related activities and transportation to stores. Purchased services and capital goods emissions are calculated using emission factors derived from an environmentally extended multi- regional input-output model based on 2022 EXIOBASE v3.8.2 data. Emission factors used to calculate emissions for fuel-related activities and upstream transport and distribution are sourced from the DESNZ & DEFRA UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (2024). Purchased goods emissions, from energy and industry (E/I) and forestry, land use and agricultural (FLAG) sources, are calculated separately using emissions factors from the Waste and Resources Action Plan (WRAP) v1.2 FLAG Emissions database (2023) and other scientific, publicly available sources. In the energy and industry (E/I) category, packaging-related emissions are calculated using DEFRA factors. Scope 3 (downstream): GHG emissions resulting from the consumption of electricity and refrigerants in stores. For GHG emissions related to refrigerants, the GWP coefficients were derived from the DEFRA database or data sheets for specific refrigerants. When calculating GHG emissions for electricity, with the location-based and market-based methods, data from the National Centre for Emissions Management (KOBiZE), the National Centre for Emission Balancing and Management and modified by DEFRA were used. The difference between location-based and market-based Scope 3 GHG emissions is driven by the consideration of certification of origins. Scope 3 GHG emissions categories that were considered material are: category 1) Purchased goods and services, category 2) Capital goods, category 3) Fuel- and energy-related activities, category 4) Upstream transportation and distribution and category 14) Franchisees. The remaining categories 5-13 and 15 were excluded from calculation as they are not relevant or not material for the Żabka Polska. Calculations related to approximately 80% of stores are based on real data (gathered from energy meters). Approximately 20% is estimated. 96 2024 Annual Report C.1. 2024 ESG highlights C.2.

Biological materials from sustainable sources are packaging that have either FSC or PEFC certifications. The total weight of materials used in 2024 is the denominator for those indicators expressed in percentages. [E5-5] Resource outflows - products and materials Data Point Unit 2024 The rates of recyclable content in products packaging % 51.9 Contextual information Resource outflows are materials and products that come out of an organisation’s production processes and that are then put on the market (including packaging). Group entities don’t have production processes per se, except for Maczfit (for the manufacture of meals). As a Group, we introduce materials such as glass, plastic, paper, wood and metal to the market, which are used in packaging forms such as trays, bowls, cups, bottles, cans, soft films for sandwich packaging, top films, labels and more. Żabka Polska introduces such materials to the market from the upstream value chain under its own brands, such as Foodini, Wycisk, Dobra Karma, S! etc., which are designed along circular principles. (See section C.3.3. Circularity under ‘Optimised product packaging, including reduced use of virgin plastic’ for more details.) When compiling the rate of recyclable content in product packaging, we used as denominator the overall total weight of the materials (packaging) used during the reporting period. Data on these includes own brand packaging, imported materials introduced to the market and logistics materials used for transport. The numerator is recyclable content in products packaging.
