This supports the trajectory towards the 2030 target, that integrates expected upcoming aircraft production ramp-up. Airbus SE/ Report of the Board of Directors 2024 167"
"6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)”). Financial resources for mitigation actions The Company estimates that a couple of hundred million euros per year (combined OpEx and CapEx) may be necessary to complete its Scopes 1 & 2 decarbonisation plan. This estimate is indicative and may be revised pending evolution and progress of the project portfolio. ADAPTATION Leveraging the preliminary outcomes of its resilience analysis, including at site level, the Company is starting to identify and plan adaptation measures that need to be undertaken locally. They are being prioritised, taking into account the estimated time of horizons and / or speed of onset of respective risks. Actions have already been engaged, corresponding to the risks deemed more imminent such as extreme heat and floods. For instance, in Airbus Toulouse a heatwave preparation plan was implemented, and a study on the arduousness and dangerousness of working in high heat was carried out by the occupational health service and the occupational physician. This study focused on the feedback from experiences conducted during the 2023 heatwave, during which 150 workers tested ""Heat stroke alert"" bracelets and cooling clothing. These experiences continued in 2024, and personal protective equipment related to heat will be tested and used again in the coming years. In Airbus Illescas in Spain, following the 2022 heatwave, forced ventilation was installed in all the technical rooms. Green areas have also been adapted, with Japanese gardens combining local plants requiring less water, and a drop irrigation system. Good practices such as free cooling, the use of heat and humidity sensors in technical rooms (connected to a Building Maintenance System) and the use of UV sheets to cover windows are also being implemented by several sites, for instance in Premium Aerotec Varel (PAI Varel). Some measures were also put in place to prevent the impact of flooding events. Flood barriers were installed in Airbus Atlantic Nantes after the site was impacted by an intense flooding event in recent years. In PAI Varel, a weather station is used to control the smoke exhaust closures during rain or strong wind events, and all gutters and water drains are systematically checked and cleaned after each stormy episode. In addition, the design and building of new facilities take into consideration applicable standards aimed at reducing their vulnerability to climate related hazards. The Company will continuously complement, sequence and refine its approach as additional information becomes available, including from its on-going resilience analysis. Certain actions may imply engaging with local authorities and/or communities. Additional actions related to water stress risk are presented in “– 6.2.4 ESRS E3 - Water and marine resources”.

"6.2.2.3 Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)”, includes the risk that the Company or its suppliers may fail to mitigate the acute or chronic impacts of future climate change on their industrial sites. Additionally, failure to adapt products to perform effectively under future atmospheric conditions in a timely manner, relative to the speed of these risks' onset or time horizon could lead to production disruptions or a product offering that no longer meets customer expectations. This could negatively affect financial performance. Climate mitigation: Climate mitigation risk, detailed in “– 6.2.2.3 Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)”, includes the risk that the Company or its suppliers may not meet their decarbonisation ambitions or the late availability of low emissions technology could lead to, respectively, investor mistrust or products failing to meet customer expectations. This could negatively affect financial performance. Energy: Climate-related energy risk, detailed in “– 6.2.2.3 Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)”, includes the risk that renewable and low carbon energy (e.g. SAF, hydrogen) may not be available in sufficient quantities in the necessary time frames. This could lead to less air travel and lower demand for aircraft or for future aircraft programmes if not suited to available energy sources, which could negatively affect financial performance. E2 - Pollution Impact: Pollution of air: Aircraft and aircraft parts painting and cleaning within certain facilities of the Company lead to volatile organic compound emissions, potentially resulting in air pollution if adequate mitigation measures are not used. Pollution of water and living organisms and food resources: Production of aviation fuel in the downstream value chain may lead to emissions into water, which may contribute to water pollution and to pollution of living organisms and food resources if adequate mitigation measures are not used. Risk: Substances of (very high) concern: There is a risk that the Company or its suppliers may not be in a position to substitute substances of concern or of very high concern in due time in accordance with regulatory requirements. This could lead to business disruption across the value chain and to the Company not being able to deliver aircraft to its customers, which could negatively affect financial performance and damage its reputation. E3 - Water Impact: Water - Habitat degradation: See Pollution of water and living organisms and food resources above. Risk: Water consumption and withdrawal: There is a risk that the Company or its suppliers may fail to mitigate the potential impact of water stress—related to climate change—on water consumption, usage and withdrawal in their industrial operations, within a timely manner relative to the onset of such risks. This could lead to production disruptions, which could negatively affect financial performance. E4 - Biodiversity Impact: Direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss and impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems: the air transport sector's use of aircraft in operation leads to GHG emissions that may indirectly impact biodiversity. Pollution: Production of aviation fuel in the downstream value chain may lead to water pollution, which may contribute to biodiversity loss if adequate mitigation measures are not used.

"6.2.2.2 ​Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1) In line with the Company’s purpose, “pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world”, and its aim to lead the transition of the air transport sector towards the goal set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to reach ‘net zero carbon emissions by 2050’, the Company’s foremost ambition is to play a leading role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. This includes developing technologies for the next generations of commercial aircraft, and the ambition to bring a commercially viable, fully electric, hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft into service. Based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) remaining global carbon budget and the share it allocates to air transport, air transport can grow at up to a certain level and meet the Paris Agreement objectives. This relies in part on technological developments to improve the fuel efficiency of air transport, in which the Company and its suppliers have a role to play. This approach also echoes “net-zero carbon emissions by 2050” ambitions from international sectoral bodies such as the ATAG, as well as the UN specialised civil aviation body, ICAO. This is consistent with the Company’s near-term target setting, covering all three scopes of emissions, and with its core product policy that focuses on developing and delivering more efficient aircraft while engaging with the energy ecosystem. The Company has set combined near-term targets to reduce its GHG emissions (please refer to “– 6.2.2.6 Targets (E1-4)” for a detailed description) that are validated by the SBTi as being science-based and aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C for Scopes 1 and 2 and with well-below 2°C for Scope 3 relating to the use of its commercial aircraft in service (Scope 3 Use of Sold Products (Cat 11)). This is in accordance with SBTi's criteria and recommendations for near-term targets. Share of Company's Commercial business segment Scope 3 Use of Sold Products emissions Unit In overall Commercial business segment emissions (all scopes) % >95% In overall Company emissions (all scopes) % >90% The Company's Scope 3 Use of Sold Products CO2 intensity projections (CO2/RPK) are related to the Company's delivered commercial aircraft in a given year (2015/2035) over the entire life of service. To achieve its GHG emission targets, the Company has developed a transition plan of climate mitigation actions. The plan is structured into decarbonisation levers and sub-levers, which cover innovation in the Company’s product and service portfolio, its own operations, and in the Company’s value chain. A diverse range of factors of different climate scenarios have been considered to detect relevant environmental, societal, technology, market and policy-related developments and determine decarbonisation levers. For more details on the usage of scenarios, please refer to the “– 6.2.2.3 Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)” hereafter. Key actions within each decarbonisation lever are detailed in the section “– 6.2.2.5 Actions (E1-3)”. The integration of the decarbonisation levers across all of the Company’s business activities, coupled with the focus on enhancing efficiency in its products, translates the objectives of the transition plan into the Company’s business model and strategy. The potential of technological levers to support the compatibility of the Company's business model with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 are based on its experience and expertise in the field of commercial aviation in collaboration with industrial partners such as engine manufacturers. Energy and SAF related levers are informed by the sector's work on the topic as well as elements drawn from IEA scenarios and regulatory frameworks around the world. The transition plan has been approved by the Company’s Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. Regular updates on the progress of this plan are presented to the Board’s ECSC.

"6.2.2.5 Actions (E1-3)”): Decarbonisation lever #1 - Energy efficiency (Scopes 1&2). This decarbonisation lever focuses on increasing building (stationary) energy efficiency and mobile energy efficiency. Decarbonisation lever #2 - Renewable energy (Scopes 1&2). This decarbonisation lever focuses on switching to renewable energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) (stationary), developing local site renewable energy generation (stationary), and uptake of SAF in its internal operations - logistics and flight tests - (mobile). Decarbonisation lever #3 - Technology improvement introduction (Scope 3). This decarbonisation lever focuses on the continuous improvement of the latest generation aircraft as well as developing next generation aircraft that are more fuel efficient than current models. Decarbonisation lever #4 - SAF uptake (Scope 3). This decarbonisation lever focuses on fostering the development of the SAF ecosystem, contributing to the setting of industry standards for fuels, and developing aircraft that are 100% SAF capable. Decarbonisation lever #5 - Operations improvement (Scope 3). This decarbonisation lever focuses on developing the Commercial Aircraft portfolio of services aimed at supporting customers in reducing emissions arising from the usage of commercial aircraft, in collaboration with relevant actors in the air transport sector (e.g. Air Traffic Management). The last three decarbonisation levers refer to the Company’s Scope 3 use of sold products. They imply a close collaboration with many players in the aviation and energy sectors and are consistent with the aviation sector's long-term aspirational decarbonisation goal of reaching “net-zero carbon emissions” by 2050, as illustrated on the following chart. In October 2022, the aspirational objective of “net zero carbon emissions” in 2050 for international civil aviation operations was adopted by a vast majority of ICAO member states. This political commitment paves the way for the transformation of the aviation sector, ensuring a level playing field at international level and it will accelerate the development of mitigation measures such as fleet renewal, aircraft and engine technologies, alternative energy carriers such as SAF or green hydrogen, and the enhancements of the operational practices and air traffic management. The Company fully supports this international long-term aspirational goal. The Company's activities are not excluded by the EU’s Paris-aligned benchmark framework. Investing in the future The Company’s total Research and Development budget (see table below) is mainly split between - but not limited to - investments in incremental developments of the Company’s current product portfolio which is required to maintain its competitiveness, including from a fuel / CO2 efficiency perspective, as well as investment in the development of breakthrough technologies (e.g. hydrogen based systems, electric machines, energy storage and distribution) that are required for future products.

"6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)”. Locked-in GHG emissions - Assets. Emissions from all key assets are tracked by the Company's environmental reporting. Future emissions are calculated based on local energy network assumptions and taking into account the decarbonisation levers (as described above) and the impact of industrial production evolution. Locked-in GHG emissions for these assets are calculated as the sum of yearly residual emissions until 2030, with further efforts being required for evaluating the locked-in GHG emissions until 2050. Locked-in emissions were taken into account when GHG emission reduction targets were set. For more details on how the Company plans to manage its GHG-intensive and energy intensive assets and products, refer to the “– 6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)” and “– 6.2.2.5 Actions (E1-3)”.

This supports the trajectory towards the 2030 target, that integrates expected upcoming aircraft production ramp-up. Airbus SE/ Report of the Board of Directors 2024 167"
"6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)” Since 2015, the improvement of commercial aircraft Scope 3 efficiency - measured through this metric - was largely supported by significant investments into new aircraft technology and designs, as well as by projected SAF uptake impact to a lower extent. Given the variable time horizons of each of the five decarbonisation pathways presented above, it is expected that the forecasted increase of SAF used by airlines in the coming decades will have a decisive impact for achieving this target by 2035. In order to be able to check how actual global penetration of SAF is consistent with its target related assumptions, the Company is developing the means to monitor actual availability and use of SAF and the resulting impact on aircraft emissions. The Company's initial approach to develop a tool that has proven insufficient and the Company is now considering alternative options. One such option is to rely on aviation industry recognised metrics being developed. For instance, IATA is maturing its analytical capability to monitor SAF consumption through direct reporting from airlines. Key figure Unit 2024 Est. annual SAF production, as per IATA report * tonnes 1 million * “Fact Sheet - Sustainable Aviation Fuels” dated Dec 9th 2024 available on IATA website For more information on the progress in implementing the transition plan, refer to section “– 6.2.2.5 Actions (E1-3)”. 6.2.2.3 ​Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3) Following the TCFD recommendations, the Company has defined a range of temperature scenarios (1.5°C, well-below 2°C and >3°C) to represent different climate realities based upon the global scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (""IPCC"" - Assessment Report 6 (""AR6"")) and the International Energy Agency (""IEA""). The scenario analysis is used to identify financial and operational risks and opportunities related to climate change that may begin to impact the Company in the short-term, medium-term and long-term so that the Company can work to increase the resilience of its assets and Airbus SE/ Report of the Board of Directors 2024 168"
"6.2.2.3 Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)”. The resilience analysis includes a review of the Company’s own business activities and extends to both upstream and downstream segments of the value chain, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and strengths in the Company's strategy and business model concerning climate-related physical and transition risks. With the 1.5°C scenario for transition risk and the >3°C scenario for the physical risk analysis, the Company covers both extremes of climate risks, thus covering a broad spectrum of risks. As detailed above, the scope of the resilience analysis is the same as the climate risk assessment; it includes an assessment of operations, supply chain dependencies, and customer interactions to ensure a holistic understanding of potential impacts for all of the Company’s business activities. For each remaining identified material physical and transition risks, the existing and potential adaptation measures that contribute to climate resilience are reviewed, resulting in an overall risk picture, including those residual risks where mitigation measures are insufficient to eliminate the risks entirely. The conducted analysis has identified activities related to the transition of the air transport sector as high-risk business activities, with uncertainties including the pace of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market acceptance of low-carbon solutions. This assessment of physical risks for the upstream value chain is still being conducted and therefore is not yet included in these results. The outcomes to date of the physical and transition risk assessments are summarised in the hereafter tables, as well as how these risks are managed to ensure the resilience of the Company's assets and activities. As mentioned previously, the resilience analysis is still ongoing and is expected to be completed in 2027. Climate-related risks The results of the Company’s climate scenario analysis has led to the identification of the following main risks: ●​ Transition - Technology: Emergence of disruptive technologies from competition Delivering on existing commitments and potential future requirements to mitigate climate impacts will require significant investments in new technologies for the commercial aircraft sector, making the delivery of low-emission technologies a significant marker of future competitiveness. A competitor or new market participant could have access to technological developments unavailable to the Company that offer significantly lower emissions at a faster pace than the Company and its partners, resulting in a loss of market share and competitiveness with resulting reduced revenue. The imperative for the Company and its partners to develop new technologies faster than other actors in the market will require substantial research and technology (R&T) and research and development investments.

"6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)” and to the above mentioned risk management mitigation measures provide a first understanding of the Company's ability to adapt its strategy and business model to climate change. Additionally, the section “– 6.2.2.5 Actions (E1-3)” provides further information on the adaptation actions taken by the Company to reinforce its resilience. More precisely, with regards to product resilience in the context of climate change, aircraft products are sensitive to weather phenomena during their operation phase. While the certified flight envelopes of the Company’s products offer some margin compared to relevant bad atmospheric conditions defined by certification authorities, the adaptation of aircraft design and operation to the changing climate is an important activity to be anticipated, in particular given the long lead time associated with aircraft development and operation. With regards to its defence product portfolio, the Company is collaborating with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) and other defence industry players and organisations (in the so-called NATO Study Group 291) with the objective of developing recommendations on ensuring allied capabilities adaptation in the context of climate change. This is supported by inputs from the NATO Climate and Defence Task Force led by the Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD) the Company is also part of, together with the allied governments and other defence industry players. This collaboration aims at assessing, elaborating and deploying solutions to ensure technical capabilities still enable operational effectiveness in facing changing climatic conditions.

For further detail on the content of the Environmental Policy, its scope, accountability, relevant third party standards and initiatives as well as the availability to and stakeholders and the considerations of their interests, please refer to the transversal section “– 6.2.1 Policies”. 6.2.2.5 ​Actions and resources (E1-3) Climate mitigation and adaptation-related actions are coordinated by the Sustainability Organisation under the leadership of the Chief Sustainability Officer, which includes multifunctional and cross-divisional teams on CO2 and Energy, as well as a dedicated organisation for SAF. Annual sustainability budgets are allocated to each function to implement said actions. The emissions reduction estimates presented in the tables below are indicative and represent the Company’s best view on how it intends to reach its targets, based on current assumptions, modelling (including effects of increasing production output) and portfolio of projects reducing CO2 emissions and offsetting business growth. They may be refined over time as forecast techniques may improve and the portfolio of decarbonisation projects may be revised or re-prioritised to capture new opportunities or adapt to changes in market conditions. The Company has not identified any dependencies on the availability and allocation of resources for the implementation of the below actions unless otherwise stipulated. MITIGATION The actions listed below support the achievement of the related target, which applies to the Company’s own operations and operationally controlled entities. They have so far been implemented in priority on sites for which measured data is available, covering a large proportion of the concerned impact (see methodology in “– 6.2.2.6 Energy consumption and Mix (E1-5)” and “– 6.2.2.7 GHG Emissions (E1-6)”). Decarbonisation lever #1 - Scopes 1 & 2 - Energy efficiency The Company is committed to enhancing energy efficiency for its buildings and industrial processes as part of its climate change action plan. This initiative, which encompasses improvements in lighting, insulation, and combined heat and power (CHP) optimisation, is on-going and planned to be further implemented company-wide by 2030.

"6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)”). Financial resources for mitigation actions The Company estimates that a couple of hundred million euros per year (combined OpEx and CapEx) may be necessary to complete its Scopes 1 & 2 decarbonisation plan. This estimate is indicative and may be revised pending evolution and progress of the project portfolio. ADAPTATION Leveraging the preliminary outcomes of its resilience analysis, including at site level, the Company is starting to identify and plan adaptation measures that need to be undertaken locally. They are being prioritised, taking into account the estimated time of horizons and / or speed of onset of respective risks. Actions have already been engaged, corresponding to the risks deemed more imminent such as extreme heat and floods. For instance, in Airbus Toulouse a heatwave preparation plan was implemented, and a study on the arduousness and dangerousness of working in high heat was carried out by the occupational health service and the occupational physician. This study focused on the feedback from experiences conducted during the 2023 heatwave, during which 150 workers tested ""Heat stroke alert"" bracelets and cooling clothing. These experiences continued in 2024, and personal protective equipment related to heat will be tested and used again in the coming years. In Airbus Illescas in Spain, following the 2022 heatwave, forced ventilation was installed in all the technical rooms. Green areas have also been adapted, with Japanese gardens combining local plants requiring less water, and a drop irrigation system. Good practices such as free cooling, the use of heat and humidity sensors in technical rooms (connected to a Building Maintenance System) and the use of UV sheets to cover windows are also being implemented by several sites, for instance in Premium Aerotec Varel (PAI Varel). Some measures were also put in place to prevent the impact of flooding events. Flood barriers were installed in Airbus Atlantic Nantes after the site was impacted by an intense flooding event in recent years. In PAI Varel, a weather station is used to control the smoke exhaust closures during rain or strong wind events, and all gutters and water drains are systematically checked and cleaned after each stormy episode. In addition, the design and building of new facilities take into consideration applicable standards aimed at reducing their vulnerability to climate related hazards. The Company will continuously complement, sequence and refine its approach as additional information becomes available, including from its on-going resilience analysis. Certain actions may imply engaging with local authorities and/or communities. Additional actions related to water stress risk are presented in “– 6.2.4 ESRS E3 - Water and marine resources”.

While the plan defined to reach this target includes actions differentiated for Scope 1 and Scope 2, no additional sub-targets were formalised for Scope 1 and Scope 2 separately. The Scopes 1 and 2 target is validated by SBTi as being science-based and aligned with a 1.5°C scenario. The 2015 baseline has been set Company-wide as per SBTi requirements. The Company is considering future developments and their impacts on its Scopes 1 and 2 target, in line with requirements of applicable SBTi guidance and as outlined in the Transition Plan (see section “– 6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)”). The SBTI Guidance 4.2 methodology was used to set the target and the Company sets-out to update the target at least every five years, in accordance with applicable SBTi guidance. A 2050 target has not yet been defined. This Company-wide target covers the Company’s own operations and operationally controlled entities Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (market-based for Scope 2) and target boundaries were defined in accordance with SBTi guidance 4.2. To operationalise the 2030 target, it is broken down in annual reduction targets and reductions are allocated across sites: they refer to a material sub-perimeter of its operations, referred to as Top Company Objectives (“TCO”) scope, on which the Company can have a more direct control and influence, and used by the Company to steer its annual progress (see “Scope of reporting and methodology” in “– 6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)”). The target is a combined target for Scopes 1 and 2 which has been defined along guidelines set-out by SBTi guidance 4.2, including its baseline value. No intensity target has been set. For Scope 2 emissions, the target is based on the market-based GHG accounting method. The Company involved a wide range of internal stakeholders, incl. Facility Management, Industrial Operations, Finance, and Procurement, as well as the Board, during the target-setting process. No changes were made to the target during the reporting period. Target achievement is monitored through the Company’s environmental reporting process, which includes yearly and monthly reporting. Currently, the performance is in line with expectations - see “– 6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)” for more details on achievements. The target is aligned with the vision set out in the Environmental Policy to continually improve manufacturing and site operations to reduce emissions in line with the ambition of the Paris Agreement.

"6.2.2.10 ​ Internal carbon pricing (E1-8) Key figure Unit Internal carbon price EUR / tCO2 150 Transition plan CapEx and OpEx The Company has established CO2 reduction targets for Scopes 1, 2, and Scope 3 Use of Sold Products emissions, which have been validated by SBTi (see section “– 6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1))”. Over the years, progress has been made in reducing emissions and towards achieving these targets. This progress is largely attributable to the Company’s strategic focus on investments (e.g. industrial assets), and operational measures (e.g. SAF purchase) aimed at decarbonising energy usage and improving energy efficiency, among other initiatives, which are centrally managed and prioritised by the Company. CO2 savings are inherently the primary decision criterion for this category of investments, and the use of a shadow carbon price - as described in the following paragraphs - had therefore a limited influence on these CapEx investment decisions. Details on investments and measures are disclosed in section “– 6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1)”. CapEx investments (Scopes 1 & 2) The Company has started to apply a shadow carbon price in its broader decision-making process to assess the financial impact of carbon emissions and influence decisions accordingly. This fixed price (see table above) was established considering benchmarks, carbon price projections from various relevant sources such as those of the IPCC 2018, IEA and IRENA 2017 and French authorities, as well as the Company's intention to make it an influential factor. The price aims to signal to project leaders the importance of CO2 footprint reduction and to support consistency of investment decision making with the Company’s commitments to decarbonisation. The integrated internal pricing mechanism factors the internal carbon price into net present value and internal rate of return calculations as part of business case evaluations. By incorporating the cost of carbon, the Company seeks a more holistic financial analysis of its CapEx projects. The financial component in decision making therefore strives to integrate internal carbon price, and favour those investments with a better CO2 footprint. As per the governance established on that matter, internal carbon price is applied in the business cases of CapEx dossiers for operations for Commercial Aircraft. While the actual use is still partial, the Company intends to continue deploying it in the coming years. Challenges to progress result from certain projects inherently having a minimal direct carbon footprint, or the associated CO2 emissions may be difficult to quantify or assign accurately, especially in complex supply chains or shared infrastructure. Product incremental development (Scope 3 Use of Sold Products) From November 2023, the use of the shadow carbon price was extended to current aircraft programmes’ product related major incremental developments in Airbus commercial aircraft business segment, supporting its Scope 3 emission reduction ambition. The internal carbon price is used when the Company introduces modifications to existing aircraft programmes, many of which could reduce drag or save weight in its aircraft design to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, while accuracy could still be materially improved with further standardised methodologies to assign a CO2 emissions to specific modifications. Of note, the use of this internal carbon pricing mechanism is not deemed appropriate in business cases related to any future programmes, to the extent that the energy dimension is embedded in related modelling and projections.

For more information, please refer to section “– 6.2.2.6 Targets (E1-4)”. 6.2.6 ​ ESRS E5 - Resource use and circular economy While aerospace represents a small fraction of the global volumes for most materials, it is among the main users for some highly specialised materials (e.g. titanium). Key Figure Unit Proportion of Company’s aluminium consumption in the global market % About 0.1% The use of these materials, and the impacts associated with their production or end-of-life, are justified by their contribution to the efficiency of the end product, as they enable lighter structures and more efficient design. As the major portion of a typical aircraft’s life cycle impact comes from its operational use phase, using lighter materials (which are sometimes more impactful in their production processes) is particularly effective in regards to achieving significant reductions in energy consumption and emissions overall. Key figure Unit Typical aircraft’s GHG life cycle impact coming from its operational use phase % 90% Product weight optimisation is largely linked to product performance in terms of range and fuel consumption, and therefore has a benefit for customers. Optimising the use of such high-value materials is directly linked to the Company’s competitiveness, while securing their supply, as they become scarcer, is necessary to ensure business continuity. Accordingly, the Company's circularity approach, that includes in-sourcing and waste management dimensions, relies on several complementary levers that include and can be illustrated as follows: ●​ “Avoid” or material use optimisation - Weight reduction through material use optimisation has always been a priority in aerospace, as this is directly linked to aircraft performance. More optimised design and manufacturing processes for metallic and composite components can improve the buy-to-fly ratios, as well as reduce weight, material consumption, energy consumption and production costs. For instance, forming technology has led to an aluminium material reduction of 80% for some parts compared to machining from a plate. ●​ “Reduce” industrial waste - The Company focuses on the waste generated by its sites in the manufacturing process, which is embedded in a waste target.

To achieve its GHG emission targets, the Company has developed a transition plan of climate mitigation actions. The plan is structured into decarbonisation levers and sub-levers, which cover innovation in the Company’s product and service portfolio, its own operations, and in the Company’s value chain. A diverse range of factors of different climate scenarios have been considered to detect relevant environmental, societal, technology, market and policy-related developments and determine decarbonisation levers. For more details on the usage of scenarios, please refer to the “– 6.2.2.3 Description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)” hereafter. Key actions within each decarbonisation lever are detailed in the section “– 6.2.2.5 Actions (E1-3)”. The integration of the decarbonisation levers across all of the Company’s business activities, coupled with the focus on enhancing efficiency in its products, translates the objectives of the transition plan into the Company’s business model and strategy. The potential of technological levers to support the compatibility of the Company's business model with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 are based on its experience and expertise in the field of commercial aviation in collaboration with industrial partners such as engine manufacturers. Energy and SAF related levers are informed by the sector's work on the topic as well as elements drawn from IEA scenarios and regulatory frameworks around the world. The transition plan has been approved by the Company’s Executive Committee and the Board of Directors. Regular updates on the progress of this plan are presented to the Board’s ECSC.

"6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)” Since 2015, the improvement of commercial aircraft Scope 3 efficiency - measured through this metric - was largely supported by significant investments into new aircraft technology and designs, as well as by projected SAF uptake impact to a lower extent. Given the variable time horizons of each of the five decarbonisation pathways presented above, it is expected that the forecasted increase of SAF used by airlines in the coming decades will have a decisive impact for achieving this target by 2035. In order to be able to check how actual global penetration of SAF is consistent with its target related assumptions, the Company is developing the means to monitor actual availability and use of SAF and the resulting impact on aircraft emissions. The Company's initial approach to develop a tool that has proven insufficient and the Company is now considering alternative options. One such option is to rely on aviation industry recognised metrics being developed. For instance, IATA is maturing its analytical capability to monitor SAF consumption through direct reporting from airlines.

"6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)” The target is set on the aggregate of Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based. While the plan defined to reach this target includes actions differentiated for Scope 1 and Scope 2, no additional sub-targets were formalised for Scope 1 and Scope 2 separately. The Scopes 1 and 2 target is validated by SBTi as being science-based and aligned with a 1.5°C scenario. The 2015 baseline has been set Company-wide as per SBTi requirements. The Company is considering future developments and their impacts on its Scopes 1 and 2 target, in line with requirements of applicable SBTi guidance and as outlined in the Transition Plan (see section “– 6.2.2.2 Transition plan for climate mitigation (E1-1)”). The SBTI Guidance 4.2 methodology was used to set the target and the Company sets-out to update the target at least every five years, in accordance with applicable SBTi guidance. A 2050 target has not yet been defined. This Company-wide target covers the Company’s own operations and operationally controlled entities Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (market-based for Scope 2) and target boundaries were defined in accordance with SBTi guidance 4.2. To operationalise the 2030 target, it is broken down in annual reduction targets and reductions are allocated across sites: they refer to a material sub-perimeter of its operations, referred to as Top Company Objectives (“TCO”) scope, on which the Company can have a more direct control and influence, and used by the Company to steer its annual progress (see “Scope of reporting and methodology” in “– 6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)”). The target is a combined target for Scopes 1 and 2 which has been defined along guidelines set-out by SBTi guidance 4.2, including its baseline value. No intensity target has been set. For Scope 2 emissions, the target is based on the market-based GHG accounting method. The Company involved a wide range of internal stakeholders, incl. Facility Management, Industrial Operations, Finance, and Procurement, as well as the Board, during the target-setting process. No changes were made to the target during the reporting period. Target achievement is monitored through the Company’s environmental reporting process, which includes yearly and monthly reporting. Currently, the performance is in line with expectations - see “– 6.2.2.8 GHG Emissions (E1-6)” for more details on achievements. The target is aligned with the vision set out in the Environmental Policy to continually improve manufacturing and site operations to reduce emissions in line with the ambition of the Paris Agreement.

This supports the trajectory towards the 2030 target, that integrates expected upcoming aircraft production ramp-up. 6.2.4.5 ​Metrics (E3-4) Scope of reporting and methodology: Reported data covers Company’s own operations. In addition and to the extent the Company related target applies to its own operations and operationally controlled entities, it reports a second figure on this extended perimeter. Most data was reported by entities (see table below): while generally measured or communicated by water suppliers, certain specific information from sites may be estimated based on past performance when not available. Information related to the rest of the consolidation perimeter was estimated, following a documented methodology, which is based on modelling: employed-based, activity-based extrapolation as deemed relevant for the concerned metrics. By exception to the consolidation perimeter described above, some small non-controlled entities have been included in the reported figures due to their co-location with consolidated entities (see table below). Water consumption is defined as the difference between water withdrawal volumes and water discharge volumes. All volumes of water withdrawal per source and volumes of water discharges by destination are reported by each entity.

Metering and monitoring The Company undertakes improvement of water metering and monitoring to better understand water usage and identify deviations and abnormalities. Notable implementations in 2024 include the deployment of digitised and automated real-time water withdrawal monitoring at Company’s sites in Spain and France. Leak management The Company strives to detect, repair and prevent water leakages in order to minimise unnecessary water withdrawal. This continuous initiative received particular focus in 2024 and has led to the identification and repair of several leaks in a number of the Company’s sites in France and the UK. Water reduction and reuse The Company develops water recycling and water reuse systems. For example, in 2024, Company sites have adapted processes and equipment to establish closed-loop systems where water is being reused, such as in the press cooling systems in Bremen, Germany. In addition, the Company aims to reduce its water usage by reviewing its industrial processes and equipment. 2024 examples include upgrade of cooling systems and non-destructive testing processes at locations such as Illescas, Spain and Nantes, France. Rainwater harvesting The Company implements rainwater harvesting in order to replace the use of drinking water in industrial and sanitary equipment. As of the end of 2024, this system has been deployed at several Company sites, including Airbus in Toulouse, France; Broughton, UK; and Airbus Helicopters in Paris-Le Bourget, France. Employee engagement The Company also acts on employee engagement in order to raise awareness on water management challenges. In 2024, this included deploying awareness campaigns, such as communications on the World Water Day via the Company’s intranet as well as onsite awareness-raising activities. Sites assessments In 2023, the Company undertook studies supported by external expertise across several Company sites to evaluate the water management maturity level of these sites and identify relevant opportunities to further reduce water withdrawal. Additionally, other sites have conducted self-assessments using the same methodology. In 2024, this approach was extended to additional sites Airbus SE/ Report of the Board of Directors 2024 192"

In addition and to the extent the Company related target applies to its own operations and operationally controlled entities, it reports a second figure on this extended perimeter. Most data was reported by entities (see table below): while generally measured or communicated by water suppliers, certain specific information from sites may be estimated based on past performance when not available. Information related to the rest of the consolidation perimeter was estimated, following a documented methodology, which is based on modelling: employed-based, activity-based extrapolation as deemed relevant for the concerned metrics. By exception to the consolidation perimeter described above, some small non-controlled entities have been included in the reported figures due to their co-location with consolidated entities (see table below). Water consumption is defined as the difference between water withdrawal volumes and water discharge volumes. All volumes of water withdrawal per source and volumes of water discharges by destination are reported by each entity.

"6.2.1 Policies”, emphasises the importance of addressing substances of concern by driving the development of solutions aimed at substituting and reducing the use of regulated substances throughout the product life cycle. This approach supports compliance with applicable regulations, protection of human health and the environment and mitigates obsolescence risks for the Company in relation to substances of concern. Incidents avoidance and emergency situations are covered in Airbus Environmental Management System. For further detail on the key contents of the Environmental Policy, its scope, accountability, relevant third party standards and initiatives as well as the availability to stakeholders and the consideration of their interests, please refer to the transversal section on Environmental Policy (see section “– 6.2.1 Policies”). The use and management of chemical substances are subject to specific requirements, with the main regulations covering the Company’s activities and products being EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals (REACH); Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP). 6.2.3.2.2 ​ Actions and resources (E2-2) Some substances used in the global aerospace industry to meet the stringent technical performance standards required for certification and airworthiness are subject to regulations. These regulations impact key industrial processes and products, such as surface treatments, primers and fire protection. The Company works with suppliers and the wider industry with the aim of developing suitable alternatives to the Company’s uses of such substances and actively promotes the development and use of suitable alternatives, across product life-cycles.

"6.2.1 Policies”, outlines its environmental management and is designed to manage various environmental aspects, such as Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOC”) emissions. In the context of this Policy, the Company is committed to continually reducing its environmental footprint through its industrial operations by implementing innovative technologies and solutions, including to reduce air emissions. For further detail on the content of the Environmental Policy, its scope, accountability, relevant third party standards and initiatives as well as the availability to and stakeholders and the considerations of their interests, please refer to the transversal section on Environmental Policy (see section “– 6.2.1 Policies”). The Company is subject to pollution-related regulatory requirements, some of which being embedded into the permits granted by local authorities to its sites. In addition, the Company’s ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System notably applies the standard recommendations for pollution control audits, training, risk assessment and identification, implementation of risk prevention procedures (e.g. emergency plans, simulation exercises). For example, sites shall conduct an analysis of environmental aspects and impacts at least every three years, as well as each time a material change in operations occurs, also in connection with the Company’s ERM process. The Airbus Environmental Management System is intended to cover incidents avoidance and emergency situations. 6.2.3.3.2 ​ Actions and resources (E2-2) Monitoring The Company monitors Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) emissions to identify the main emitters of VOC within its industrial processes. The VOC emissions are directly measured where required by regulation or calculated through a mass-balance approach. The scope of these continuous actions includes the Company's own operations. These efforts fall under the ""avoid pollution"" and “reduce pollution” steps of the pollution mitigation hierarchy. This action enables the Company to quantify the VOC emissions and focus actions on priority areas. Storage and handling of raw materials In order to prevent or reduce fugitive VOC emissions during storage and handling of solvent-containing materials, the Company applies various practices, including covering of containers in storage and minimisation of storage in production Airbus SE/ Report of the Board of Directors 2024 189"

"6.3.2.6 Characteristics of the undertaking’s employees (S1-6)”) Scope 1. Calculation includes contractual instruments (Biomethane Guarantees of Origines) as part of Scope 1 emissions, calculated based on biomethane emission factors instead of natural gas. This approach will be refined as further related guidance is issued by the GHG protocol. Emissions factors used are based on national references for the Companies’ core countries (France, Germany, Spain, UK) and on international references such as the IPCC for other countries. Key figure Unit 2024 Scope 1 Savings related to contractual instruments (Biomethane GoO) ktCO2eq 17 Scope 2. Contractual instruments used to calculate Scope 2 market based GHG emissions are -1- Power Purchase Agreements (direct wire or sleeved PPAs), -2- energy attributes certificates (e.g. REC, GoO, IREC, ETC), -3- other renewable electricity contracts. The share energy bundled with attributes or unbundled has been taken into account for all contractual instruments. All three above categories are used by the Company. So far energy attributes certificates have been the vast majority. Their respective shares in total use vary over time. Emission factors were determined following the hierarchy recommended by the GHG protocol, prioritising contractual instruments or supplier emission factors when available over national or residual emission factors (from IEA and AIB databases).

Emissions Metrics - Pollution of Air Unit 2024 VOC tons 155 VOC on Target perimeter ⚐ tons 1,230 6.2.3.4 ​Pollution of water and pollution of living organisms and food The Company has identified that its environmental impacts, risks, and opportunities related to pollution of water and pollution of living organisms and food are found exclusively within the up- and downstream value chain as a potential impact of the kerosene production processes. An overview of all IROs related to pollution can be found in section “– 6.2.3.1 IROs Pollution”. While LCA leads to identifying such a potential impact, the Company has limited ability to influence the operations of oil & gas companies and does not have any relevant information. 6.2.4 ​ ESRS E3 - Water and marine resources 6.2.4.1 ​Water IROs The following IROs were identified for water: ESRS (sub-)topic Impact, risk or opportunity Description Time horizon Location in the value chain ESRS E-3 - Water Water: > Water consumption > Water withdrawals Risk There is a risk that the Company or its suppliers may fail to mitigate the potential impact of water stress - related to climate change - on water consumption, usage and withdrawal in their industrial operations, within a timely manner relative to the onset of such risks. This could lead to production disruptions, which could negatively affect financial performance. / Own Operations Upstream ESRS E-3 - Water Water - Habitat degradation: Impact See Pollution of water and living organisms and food resources in ESRS E2 Pollution The Company’s water usage is mostly linked to non-industrial uses, including sanitary, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, canteens and fire extinguishing. Around one third of the water withdrawn is used for industrial uses such as climate control of industrial facilities (e.g. clean rooms for satellite assembly, paint-shops), surface treatment, machining and non-destructive testing. Procuring the required water does not currently represent a material cost for the Company as overall withdrawn volumes are relatively limited, especially for its industrial operations. However, securing water availability to operate the industrial processes requiring water is critical for the Company to ensure business continuity. Environmental risks and opportunities are managed following the Company’s ERM system, as described in the section “– 6.1.1.4.1 IRO-1: Description of the processes to identify and assess material IROs”. This covers among other risks related to water accessibility in areas of high and extremely high water stress. Airbus SE/ Report of the Board of Directors 2024 191"
