"4.1.2.1.7 Metrics). Transition plan - Key policy principles on climate change mitigation Veolia is committed to addressing the climate challenge, by acting to decarbonize Group companies and help them adapt to the changes already in place. This commitment is fully in line with its Purpose: acting to reconcile human progress and environmental protection. As a result, in 2024, the Group published its emissions reduction ambition, the result of work integrated into the preparation of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program: to achieve Net Zero by 2050 by reducing its direct and indirect emissions and without the use of offset mechanisms (i.e. -90% direct and indirect emissions reduction in 2050 vs. 2021). This plan and these emissions reduction targets are the result of a long assessment of emission reduction drivers carried out thanks to the mobilization of the Group’s technical experts in all its businesses and in all its regions. It shall consider account sectoral realities, the degree of mastery of decarbonization techniques and local specificities in the countries where the Group operates. This plan is intended to be managed and enhanced beyond the GreenUp strategic program in future strategic plans that will follow after 2027. In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged.

"4.1.2.2.1 Introduction The topic of pollution is essential for the planet and the existence of all living beings. It takes various forms, such as air, water, or soil pollution. Beyond the conventional pollutants, the development of human activities and the increasing vigilance with regard to pollution have raised awareness of the existence of new pollutants, which have only started to be analyzed and measured recently, such as microplastics, endocrine disruptors or PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The topic of pollution is therefore diverse and concerns a high number of substances, the list of which continues to grow as studies are conducted. Hazardous waste occupies a special place among the potential sources of pollution, and the Veolia group is particularly involved in its treatment. This type of waste is subject to numerous regulations, in an increasingly strict framework to regulate its handling and treatment: ■in all areas of the world where Veolia operates, a local regulatory framework defines the qualification of hazardous waste as well as the methods of traceability, transportation, treatment and disposal; ■these national regulations are supplemented in particular by the international conventions of Basel (1989), Rotterdam (1998), Stockholm (2001), Minamata (2013), and Montreal (1987); SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 204 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
