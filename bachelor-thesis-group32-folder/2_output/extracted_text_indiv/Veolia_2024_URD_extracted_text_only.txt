It involves physical risks to which Veolia and its customers must adapt. The necessary transition to a low-carbon economy generates risks, particularly financial risks linked to project costs, but also opportunities by allowing the Group to stand out from its competitors. These dynamics also bring commercial opportunities for the Group, particularly in the decarbonization of its customers. Climate change occupies an important place in Veolia’s material issues and the materiality analysis set out in section 4.1.1.7 above led to the identification of no fewer than eight material IRO concerning the ESRS E1 standard. This section addresses the issues of climate change in terms of its mitigation as well as adaptation to this change: Climate change mitigation Group GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target and § 4.1.2.1.3 Focus on coal phase-out and methane recovery plans Third Party GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.4 Helping customers decarbonize Climate change adaptation § 4.1.2.1.5 Climate change adaptation SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 192 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target Decarbonization to limit climate change In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged. Typology of greenhouse gases taken into account in Veolia’s carbon footprint Veolia mainly emits three greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are a counterpart of the essential services provided by the Group for human activities; for reference year 2021: carbon dioxide - CO2 (73% of the GHG balance), methane - CH4 (26%) and nitrous oxide - N2O (1%). Only CO2 of fossil origin is counted in the Group’s carbon balance (e.g. incinerated non-recyclable plastics), unlike CO2 of so-called “biogenic” organic origin (e.g. food residues), which is counted separately. Biogenic carbon emissions are derived from organic elements that initially captured CO2 in the atmosphere, for example through photosynthesis. They are part of a short cycle (less than 100 years) considered to be carbon neutral. On the other hand, biogenic methane is counted because of its warming potential 28 times that of CO2. In 2024, the Group emitted 5.8 of million metric tons of scope 1 biogenic CO2 and 0.2 million metric tons of scope 2 biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion, biogas, organic waste treated in incineration, and wastewater treatment. These biogenic emissions are not included in the Group’s scope 1,2 and 3 emissions. Group activities emitting greenhouse gases (GHG) Veolia decided to follow a materiality approach in terms of GHG emitting activities. Veolia only accounts for emissions related to the highest emitting activities. Thus, emissions related to office activities (for example, emissions from headquarters or those related to certain departments such as customer service) are not taken into account by Veolia, as they are considered non-significant. The issuing activities taken into account are as follows: ■District heating network management: The urban heating networks operated by the Group distribute heat to individual and industrial customers. They allow the introduction of more “decarbonable” heating overall due to concentrated energy consumption on a few installations; ■non-hazardous waste treatment: ▪waste-to-energy recovery plays a key environmental role by reducing the volume of waste to be stored, treating certain highly toxic pollutants and also treating organic waste that would produce methane, if sent directly to landfill sites. In many countries, the most recent environmental regulations tend to favor incineration over landfill. Despite these environmental benefits, incineration continues to generate significant GHG emissions, ▪storing waste in landfill sites prevents the waste from contaminating groundwater. The positive environmental, health and social impact of these installations is crucial. However, in some countries, the lack of sorting, incinerators and composting channels means that large volumes of organic waste are stored in landfills and emit large amounts of methane. ■Hazardous waste treatment: Some waste demonstrates toxicity or danger to human health or the environment. Strict regulations and traceability apply to this waste. For waste that cannot be stored or undergo physicochemical or biological treatment (hazardous waste), high-temperature incineration is a reliable and effective solution for the destruction of pollutants; ■Water treatment: By treating water to make it drinkable or by decontaminating it before it returns to the environment, Veolia provides an essential service to human activities while preserving biodiversity. Some of these treatments, especially for wastewater, are based on the replication of natural biological processes and can emit N2O or CO2. Methodology used for the classification of emissions between scopes 1, 2 and 3 Historically, the GHG emission reporting carried out by the Group presented all the emissions from the sites owned or operated by the Group in scope 1 and 2, in application of the GHG Protocol, but without making a precise distinction for operationally controlled sites in the absence of clear criteria on the concept of operational control in the available texts. As part of the implementation of the ESRS E1 standard, Veolia carried out a detailed analysis of its CO2-emitting installations, in order to present, in accordance with paragraph 46 of ESRS E1, a clear allocation of GHG emissions according to the nature of the operational control exercised. This analysis, which is consistent with the procedure principles described in Note 4.1.1.1, was led by a multidisciplinary team of operational, legal and financial staff,and was also part of the monitoring of the Group’s decarbonization plan. It relied on the regulatory reference text: the GHG Protocol, but also on specific guides such as the additional directives on operational control under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER Act) and the Methodological Guide for the Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From the Household Waste Management Service and Similar published by ADEME (2024). It also considered connectivity with the accounting analyses carried out by the Group in order to draw up its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The objective of the analysis was to address a relevant definition of the concept of operational control for Veolia’s activities. Indeed, the definition of operational control in the CSRD (in a similar way to the GHG) specifies that it exists in situations where “the company has the capacity to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation or asset”. Regarding Veolia, this definition appeared insufficient because it did not make it possible to take into account the particular nature of activities carried out in regulated environments, such as concession arrangements, or pursuant to operator contracts (“Operation and Maintenance contract”) for example. The result was the development of an operational control analysis grid, applicable to the Group’s business models specifying the elements of operational control analysis and respecting existing texts (see below). The application of this grid led to the conclusion, by type of high-emitting assets, that the emissions of: ■Merchant Plant assets (recognized as property, plant and equipment according to IAS 16) were to be classified as scope 1 and 2, with Veolia having full powers to choose policies to exploit the asset; ■Concession assets/contracts (recognized according to IFRIC 12 interpretation as either intangible assets or financial assets) were to be classified under scope 3.8 “Upstream leased assets”, with final decisions on the operating and environmental policies belonging to the licensor; ■Pure operation and maintenance contracts (recognized as service contracts) were to be classified under 3.11 as “Use of sold products”, with Veolia responding to the request of a treatment service for waste, water, etc. on the basis of a set of obligations defined and monitored by the public or private client; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 193"
"■Entities not included in the consolidation scope had to be classified under scope 3.15 “Investments”, since Veolia does not make the final decisions on operational and environmental policies. As a result, in 2023, Veolia reallocated scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-operationally controlled assets, representing 11.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2), i.e. 35% of the Group’s scope 1 and 2, to Scope 3. In addition, Veolia updated the 2021 baseline following this change in methodology, leading to a reallocation to scope 3 representing 10.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2). This methodology change does not call into question Veolia’s commitments under its GreenUp strategic program, validated by the SBTi and Moody’s: the Group is still pursuing its objective of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by -18% by 2027 and by -50% by 2032, compared with 2021, as well as a -30% reduction across at least 67% of scope 3 emissions by 2032, and finally Net Zero (-90% for scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Alongside SBTi, Veolia is preparing an update of the waypoints on its trajectory to take account of these changes in scope This new trajectory will be submitted before the summer of 2025.

It therefore depends on the energy mix of the countries in which Veolia operates. In particular, it includes emissions linked to electricity purchased for water treatment and heat losses from heating networks. When presenting its carbon footprint, Veolia uses the market-based method. Scope 2 emissions are also calculated using the so-called location-based method. For scope 2 calculations, the emission factors of the IEA (International Energy Agency) were used.

Thus, emissions related to office activities (for example, emissions from headquarters or those related to certain departments such as customer service) are not taken into account by Veolia, as they are considered non-significant. The issuing activities taken into account are as follows: ■District heating network management: The urban heating networks operated by the Group distribute heat to individual and industrial customers. They allow the introduction of more “decarbonable” heating overall due to concentrated energy consumption on a few installations; ■non-hazardous waste treatment: ▪waste-to-energy recovery plays a key environmental role by reducing the volume of waste to be stored, treating certain highly toxic pollutants and also treating organic waste that would produce methane, if sent directly to landfill sites. In many countries, the most recent environmental regulations tend to favor incineration over landfill. Despite these environmental benefits, incineration continues to generate significant GHG emissions, ▪storing waste in landfill sites prevents the waste from contaminating groundwater. The positive environmental, health and social impact of these installations is crucial. However, in some countries, the lack of sorting, incinerators and composting channels means that large volumes of organic waste are stored in landfills and emit large amounts of methane. ■Hazardous waste treatment: Some waste demonstrates toxicity or danger to human health or the environment. Strict regulations and traceability apply to this waste. For waste that cannot be stored or undergo physicochemical or biological treatment (hazardous waste), high-temperature incineration is a reliable and effective solution for the destruction of pollutants; ■Water treatment: By treating water to make it drinkable or by decontaminating it before it returns to the environment, Veolia provides an essential service to human activities while preserving biodiversity. Some of these treatments, especially for wastewater, are based on the replication of natural biological processes and can emit N2O or CO2. Methodology used for the classification of emissions between scopes 1, 2 and 3 Historically, the GHG emission reporting carried out by the Group presented all the emissions from the sites owned or operated by the Group in scope 1 and 2, in application of the GHG Protocol, but without making a precise distinction for operationally controlled sites in the absence of clear criteria on the concept of operational control in the available texts. As part of the implementation of the ESRS E1 standard, Veolia carried out a detailed analysis of its CO2-emitting installations, in order to present, in accordance with paragraph 46 of ESRS E1, a clear allocation of GHG emissions according to the nature of the operational control exercised. This analysis, which is consistent with the procedure principles described in Note 4.1.1.1, was led by a multidisciplinary team of operational, legal and financial staff,and was also part of the monitoring of the Group’s decarbonization plan. It relied on the regulatory reference text: the GHG Protocol, but also on specific guides such as the additional directives on operational control under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER Act) and the Methodological Guide for the Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From the Household Waste Management Service and Similar published by ADEME (2024). It also considered connectivity with the accounting analyses carried out by the Group in order to draw up its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The objective of the analysis was to address a relevant definition of the concept of operational control for Veolia’s activities. Indeed, the definition of operational control in the CSRD (in a similar way to the GHG) specifies that it exists in situations where “the company has the capacity to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation or asset”. Regarding Veolia, this definition appeared insufficient because it did not make it possible to take into account the particular nature of activities carried out in regulated environments, such as concession arrangements, or pursuant to operator contracts (“Operation and Maintenance contract”) for example. The result was the development of an operational control analysis grid, applicable to the Group’s business models specifying the elements of operational control analysis and respecting existing texts (see below). The application of this grid led to the conclusion, by type of high-emitting assets, that the emissions of: ■Merchant Plant assets (recognized as property, plant and equipment according to IAS 16) were to be classified as scope 1 and 2, with Veolia having full powers to choose policies to exploit the asset; ■Concession assets/contracts (recognized according to IFRIC 12 interpretation as either intangible assets or financial assets) were to be classified under scope 3.8 “Upstream leased assets”, with final decisions on the operating and environmental policies belonging to the licensor; ■Pure operation and maintenance contracts (recognized as service contracts) were to be classified under 3.11 as “Use of sold products”, with Veolia responding to the request of a treatment service for waste, water, etc. on the basis of a set of obligations defined and monitored by the public or private client; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 193"
"■Entities not included in the consolidation scope had to be classified under scope 3.15 “Investments”, since Veolia does not make the final decisions on operational and environmental policies. As a result, in 2023, Veolia reallocated scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-operationally controlled assets, representing 11.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2), i.e. 35% of the Group’s scope 1 and 2, to Scope 3. In addition, Veolia updated the 2021 baseline following this change in methodology, leading to a reallocation to scope 3 representing 10.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2). This methodology change does not call into question Veolia’s commitments under its GreenUp strategic program, validated by the SBTi and Moody’s: the Group is still pursuing its objective of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by -18% by 2027 and by -50% by 2032, compared with 2021, as well as a -30% reduction across at least 67% of scope 3 emissions by 2032, and finally Net Zero (-90% for scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Alongside SBTi, Veolia is preparing an update of the waypoints on its trajectory to take account of these changes in scope This new trajectory will be submitted before the summer of 2025.

It therefore depends on the energy mix of the countries in which Veolia operates. In particular, it includes emissions linked to electricity purchased for water treatment and heat losses from heating networks. When presenting its carbon footprint, Veolia uses the market-based method. Scope 2 emissions are also calculated using the so-called location-based method. For scope 2 calculations, the emission factors of the IEA (International Energy Agency) were used.

"4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target Decarbonization to limit climate change In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged. Typology of greenhouse gases taken into account in Veolia’s carbon footprint Veolia mainly emits three greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are a counterpart of the essential services provided by the Group for human activities; for reference year 2021: carbon dioxide - CO2 (73% of the GHG balance), methane - CH4 (26%) and nitrous oxide - N2O (1%). Only CO2 of fossil origin is counted in the Group’s carbon balance (e.g. incinerated non-recyclable plastics), unlike CO2 of so-called “biogenic” organic origin (e.g. food residues), which is counted separately. Biogenic carbon emissions are derived from organic elements that initially captured CO2 in the atmosphere, for example through photosynthesis. They are part of a short cycle (less than 100 years) considered to be carbon neutral. On the other hand, biogenic methane is counted because of its warming potential 28 times that of CO2. In 2024, the Group emitted 5.8 of million metric tons of scope 1 biogenic CO2 and 0.2 million metric tons of scope 2 biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion, biogas, organic waste treated in incineration, and wastewater treatment. These biogenic emissions are not included in the Group’s scope 1,2 and 3 emissions.

It is divided into two parts: ▪Scope 3 upstream encompasses issues related to Veolia’s purchases. For example, chemical products purchased for water treatment and fuels used for heat production. Emissions linked to assets under concession over which the Group has no operational control are also counted in scope 3 upstream (cat. 3.8). ▪Scope 3 downstream encompasses emissions related to the processing, use and end-of-life of products sold by the Group: sorted or recycled secondary materials and distributed gas. They also include emissions from operation and maintenance contracts, including those of the Hong Kong landfill sites counted in 3.11, as well as emissions related to joint ventures in 3.15. For most scope 3 elements (83%), calculations are made from business data (internal or supplier) using physical emission factors. The residual share (17%), based on expenditure data and applying monetary emission factors, should be reduced thanks to Veolia’s supplier engagement program, one focus of which is to refine the calculation of their emissions (see details of scope 3 emissions by category in section 4.1.2.1.7 Metrics). Transition plan - Key policy principles on climate change mitigation Veolia is committed to addressing the climate challenge, by acting to decarbonize Group companies and help them adapt to the changes already in place. This commitment is fully in line with its Purpose: acting to reconcile human progress and environmental protection. As a result, in 2024, the Group published its emissions reduction ambition, the result of work integrated into the preparation of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program: to achieve Net Zero by 2050 by reducing its direct and indirect emissions and without the use of offset mechanisms (i.e. -90% direct and indirect emissions reduction in 2050 vs. 2021). This plan and these emissions reduction targets are the result of a long assessment of emission reduction drivers carried out thanks to the mobilization of the Group’s technical experts in all its businesses and in all its regions. It shall consider account sectoral realities, the degree of mastery of decarbonization techniques and local specificities in the countries where the Group operates. This plan is intended to be managed and enhanced beyond the GreenUp strategic program in future strategic plans that will follow after 2027. In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario).

"The Group’s action plan to reduce direct and indirect emissions in practice For nearly 10 years, the Group has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Today, Veolia is intensifying its efforts by implementing a Net Zero strategy that involves all its businesses and regions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The material IRO concerned by this issue are listed below: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-1 Significant GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3 ) requiring the implementation of a transition plan Veolia’s climate change mitigation plan is described below. This plan impacts our value chain both upstream (purchases, etc.), in operations (modification of production tools, etc.), and downstream (provision of less carbon-intensive products: energy, drinking water, etc.). These impacts will be felt in the short term during the GreenUp plan (2024-2027) and in the medium and long term as the Group embarks on major transformations of its value chain until it achieves Net Zero in 2050. Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-3 Attractiveness for financial players due to decarbonization Veolia’s decarbonization strategy, both at its own sites and those of its customers, is an attractive factor for investors looking for players with a positive impact on the climate. Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-4 Additional costs resulting from increased regulatory requirements for GHG emissions Increasing regulatory requirements for decarbonization means strengthening investments which may struggle to make a return on the basis of the activities concerned. Depending on the nature of the obligations, the financial risk may materialize in the medium or long term. Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-5 Reduction of OpEx by increasing the energy efficiency of our installations One of the decarbonization strategies implemented at sites belonging to Veolia and its customers aim to improve the profitability of the installations through the improvement of energy efficiency and the reduction of fuel or energy consumption. The associated cost reductions have a direct impact on OpEx. Scopes 1 & 2: first reduction programs started The Group is committed to achieving Net Zero by 2050 (-90% vs. 2021). To ensure the credibility of companies committing to a carbon neutrality target by 2050, the SBTi sets an intermediate milestone of 10 years from the base year (2021 for the Veolia Group). This 10-year milestone is used by the SBTi to verify the strength of commitments made by undertakings aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. The Group has therefore built its reduction strategy within this framework with a milestone of -50% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2032 compared to 2021(1). The first reduction programs launched are aimed at reaching these targets and are scheduled to run until 2032. An acceleration of the effects of the decarbonization levers is foreseeable within the framework of the next strategic plans, which will continue to reinforce the Group’s ambition in this area. This is why the trajectory for reducing scopes 1 and 2 emissions is expected to be non-linear, with the following points of transition: ■-18% in 2027 (end of the GreenUp plan) on scopes 1 and 2 vs. 2021 - Commitment made before the validation of targets to 2032 by the SBTi; ■-33% (estimated) in 2030 on scopes 1 and 2 vs. 2021, milestone set by the CSRD. This point is calculated on the basis of the 2021-2032 trend; ■-50% in 2032 for scopes 1&2 vs. 2021, intermediate milestone toward Net Zero recorded by the SBTi. To achieve its objectives, the Group is acting on several decarbonization levers listed below in order of importance to reach the target by 2032: ■Conversion of coal-fired power stations to supply heating networks in Europe with other lower-emissions energy sources (gas, biomass, SRF, waste heat and geothermal). Veolia controls the design, construction and operation of cogeneration infrastructures using alternative fuels to coal with increased efficiencies thanks to the Group’s technologies, particularly heat pump technologies. Cogeneration allows us to make the most of primary energy consumption by simultaneously producing heat and electricity in an optimized way. Cogeneration units therefore have much higher yields than conventional installations, where heat and electricity are supplied by separate units. This results in significant primary energy savings: 15% to 30%, with a reduction in CO2 emissions of 14%, 24% and 28%, respectively, compared to installations powered by gas, fuel oil or coal. Cogeneration thus guarantees better use of the fossil and non-fossil fuels used. It is a lever for energy efficiency and decarbonization. Finally, since the production of electricity from heating network plants can be controlled, it contributes to balancing the supply and demand for electricity, particularly in countries where a significant portion of production relies on intermittent renewable energy (solar and wind). ■Increased methane capture rate in non-recyclable waste landfills; ■Improved energy efficiency, enabling a reduction in fuel, heat and electricity consumption thanks to the transformation of installations and the improvement of production processes; ■Decarbonization of the energy mix of heating networks and electricity supplying the installations that Veolia operates; ■Increase in the sorting and removal of plastic before incineration for the Waste business; ■Use of vehicles with lower greenhouse gas emissions thanks to electric or hybrid engines and less carbon-intensive fuels. A large part of the financing for the Group’s decarbonization plan is already outlined in the GreenUp 2024-2027 plan, and over the following years: ■€1.6 billion accumulated by 2030 for the coal phase-out plan; ■€85 million by 2027 for the landfill methane capture plan. In addition to these large multi-year Group budgets dedicated to types of joint actions in several countries, there are also dedicated annual budget lines to finance the deployment of other levers, and in particular to reduce the carbon footprint linked to the energy consumption of the sites, thanks to: SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 196 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 (1) The 2021 baseline of the Group’s emissions is calculated pro forma by combining Veolia’s and Suez’s integrated emissions at the time of the 2021 merger. It is representative of the Group’s activities today."
"■the reduction in consumption (energy savings, energy efficiency gains, optimization of operations); ■the supply of less carbon-intensive energy through the production of renewable energy on Veolia’s sites, as well as the overall decarbonization of national electricity production networks. Thus, between 2023 and 2024, numerous additional projects for the phasing out of coal and methane capture were approved for a total amount of €120 million, thus contributing to the reduction of the Group’s carbon footprint. To select decarbonization projects, the Group relies on an in-depth multidimensional analysis involving the technical and financial services of the project-leading subsidiary and those of headquarters. In evaluating these projects, the Group requests a quantification of CO2 emissions and an associated reduction plan. For some projects, the analysis takes into account an external cost of CO2 (if it exists in the area of the project in question), but this criterion is not used systematically for all investment projects. The Group therefore does not use an internal CO2 price to decide between its various projects.

Coal exit) • Energy efficiency WASTE • Methane capture • Removal of plastics before incineration • Vehicles with lower GHG emissions • CO2 capture 12.2 million metric tons of CO2 WATER • Decarbonization of the electricity mix (a) The 2021 pro forma emissions presented here are the sum of Veolia scope emissions published in 2021 and 2021 emissions from the Suez scope acquired and retained as of the date of publication of this document. In addition, the 2021 emissions have been updated with the new method of accounting for emissions introduced in 2024 to better reflect Veolia’s operational control over GHG emissions from operated assets. The reductions in emissions by leverage are presented net of the growth of the Group’s activities. 4.1.2.1.3 Focus on coal phase-out and methane recovery plans This section refers in particular to the material IRO below: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-2 Gradual exclusion by the financial sphere if not exiting coal-based energy production Some investors are turning away from companies using coal as fuel. Veolia has made commitments to transform its coal-fired assets in Europe in order to change fuel. The challenge of reducing GHG emissions as quickly as possible pushes governments to strengthen financial measures to encourage their sharp decrease. For about fifteen years, Veolia has been involved in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) market for its heat production plants in Europe. In addition, for several years, the financial market has gradually strengthened its policy of excluding investment and financing of assets involving coal-based energy production. The Veolia assets affected by this are largely heat production plants in Europe (Germany, Poland, Czech Republic), plus Harbin’s heating network in China. Rather than getting rid of them, the Group has chosen to adopt a responsible policy for transforming these assets. In 2018, Veolia launched a coal phase-out plan, which will enable it to fully exit this fuel in Europe by the end of 2030 and which consists of an extensive program to modify its district heating installations so as to no longer use coal as fuel. There are planned investments of €1.6 billion to exit coal in Eastern Europe between 2018 and 2030. These investments concern nine plants, three of which have already completed their transition: Braunschweig (Germany), Přerov and Kolín (Czech Republic). They will reduce the Group’s carbon footprint by 3.5 million metric tons of CO2 eq. by replacing coal with a less carbon-intensive mix including gas, biomass and heat pumps. As regards China’s heating networks, decarbonization is a real challenge given China’s dependence on coal and Veolia is continuing its discussions with Chinese authorities to find solutions. Without waiting for this obstacle to be lifted, Veolia is actively working to activate all available decarbonization levers through optimization and performance action plans. Thus, on its main heating network in Harbin, the Group has already achieved significant results with a 30% reduction in carbon intensity between 2012 and 2024. The program implemented aims for a 25% GHG emissions reduction by 2032. Progress of the coal phase-out plan in Europe The investment budget by 2030 is €1.6 billion, of which €656 million had already been invested at the end of 2024. The expected emissions reduction is as follows: ■200 kt CO2 in Germany, in relation to the already completed Braunschweig project; ■880 kt CO2 in the Czech Republic: Přerov, and Kolín which started in 2023-2024; ■2,435 kt CO2 in Poland. 2024 saw the completion of the major Poznań project, which is scheduled to start up in 2025. Progress of the GreenUp methane plan In 2024, €7 million were invested and the Group’s average capture rate increased from 58.5% in 2023 to 59.8% in 2024. Methane capture improvement is being deployed by the Group throughout its zones and in particular in Latin America, France and Australia. 2021 2024 Target 2032 CH4: Average methane capture rate (in %) (current scope) 56.3 % 59.8 % 80.0 % SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 197"
"In addition to these initiatives and in a more systemic approach, the work to assess operational risks (direct and across the entire value chain) related to climate change is structured, at all levels of the organization, around: ■analysis of operating asset exposure; ■understanding activity vulnerabilities; ■identification and deployment of adaptation actions. ANALYSE THE EXPOSURE OF OPERATIONAL ASSETS How will weather conditions evolve according to the available projections? UNDERSTAND ASSET VULNERABILITIES What impacts can climate change have on the industrial processes of activities? ASSESSMENT PROCESS ROLL OUT ADAPTATION MEASURES BASED ON VEOLIA TEAM'S EXPERTISE AND KNOW-HOW What actions can Veolia implement over the duration of the contract and beyond? In 2022 and 2023, the Group carried out an analysis of exposure to physical climate risks at more than 2,000 operational sites(1). This analysis, based on the RCP 8.5(2) scenario by 2030 and 2050, covered 7 types of potentially impactful climate hazards(3): heatwaves and cold spells, drought, heavy rains, changes in the water cycle, rising average temperatures and rising sea level. The criteria of data availability and reliability were also considered in the choice of metrics studied. This work, carried out jointly by the internal audit, risk and insurance, and sustainable development departments, has made it possible to identify the geographical areas of priority operations for adaptation efforts: Australia/New Zealand, United States, Colombia/Panama, Chile/Peru, France, Czech Republic, Spain, Morocco, and countries in the Near and Middle East. In addition, vulnerability studies are conducted on site to strengthen understanding of operational risks related to climate change (direct and across the entire value chain). Based on the Operational Climate Adaptation & Resilience Assessment (OCARA) framework developed by Carbone 4, these studies contribute to the identification and deployment of targeted adaptation actions. They include local climate projection data (e.g. Data from DRIAS and Météo France, in France). The hazards, time- frames and projection scenarios (at least the RCP8.5 scenario) studied are adapted to the challenges of the site (e.g. taking into account specific hazards such as high winds, shrinkage/swelling of clays, forest fires, etc. or time-frames defined in line with the duration of contracts or the lifetime of the installations). Since 2022, more than 20 on-site studies have been carried out (including 10 in 2024), mainly in regions with priority operations (United States, Australia, Taiwan, France, Spain), and on the Water and Waste businesses. The aim is to extend these studies to all of the Group’s activities and regions. A study lasts on average between two and six months. Capitalization on the work carried out since 2022 and the expertise of Veolia’s teams contribute to the development of tools or benchmarks such as vulnerability profiles and adaptation solution catalogs, by activity. Currently, these benchmarks cover: ■drinking water production and distribution; ■wastewater collection and treatment; ■as well as the management of non-hazardous waste (sorting, incineration and landfill). In 2025, the scope of these benchmarks will be expanded to include energy production and distribution, waste collection and hazardous waste treatment. These tools are resources for local entities (Business Units and operating sites) which will be able to identify adaptation measures and launch action plans to strengthen their resilience and that of their customers. The effective deployment of the Group’s action plans faces two main challenges: ■the availability of the necessary resources and means from its clients for their implementation; ■and the time lag between long-term climate scenarios (2050, 2100) and shorter-term investment cycles. Highlighting the concrete benefits of adaptation in terms of finance, personnel health and industrial safety remains key to facilitating decision- making and engaging all stakeholders. In 2025, the Group plans to launch work on the methodology for assessing the financial consequences of climate change. They will build on the study of the phenomena already observed and the vulnerability of the installations by integrating short, medium and long-term climate projections.

"The table below provides a frame of reference for translating the impacts of climate change into operational impacts for the Drinking Water business. Climate Risk Examples of operational vulnerabilities identified Examples of adaptation measures for the water business Heatwaves • Maintaining indoor and outdoor working conditions (productivity, health, and safety risks); • Damage to sensitive equipment (electronic and electrical); • Delays to work schedules; • Degradation of water quality due to proliferation of algae; • Water demand pressures and worsening conflicts over use; • Rising costs of energy to maintain operating temperatures; • Increased risk of fires and explosions. • Reorganize work schedules; • Improve insulation against cold/heat in buildings; • Systematically build redundancy into cooling equipment for critical applications; • Provide personal protective equipment (PPE) suitable for high temperatures; • Improve hydrogen sulfide monitoring. Heavy rains • Damage to sensitive equipment (electronic and electrical); • Pollution thresholds exceeded; • Disruption to supply chains and transportation services (preventing response to callouts); • Turbidity degrading water quality; • Facilities for treating wastewater and rainwater overwhelmed. • Raise the height of equipment based on extremes; • Prioritize emergency warning systems; • Build redundancy into electrical supply equipment; • Improved waterproofing of critical equipment; • Work with sanitation services before heavy rains occur to clear traffic lanes. Drought • Scarcity of water resources impacting the production and distribution of drinking water, and cooling requirements; • Degradation of water quality creating the need for additional treatment and/or larger facilities; • Clay shrinkage and swelling causing infrastructure damage in clay soil areas. • Ensure adequate reagent storage; • Install water reuse solutions; • Resize facilities to accommodate the additional treatments; • Prioritize redundancy in local resources and networking in collaboration with local stakeholders. Management of transition risks Combating climate change requires the transition to a low-carbon economy. While generating significant business opportunities for the Group, this transition may also give rise to a number of risks. These transition risks can take many forms: regulatory, technological, market, reputation. In 2020, the Group conducted a study on the resilience of its business model and its associated strategy, including two low-carbon transition scenarios (<2°C) by 2030. This has made it possible to target the risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy (e.g. carbon markets, withdrawal from thermal coal, reduction in landfill, heat production, electrification, reduction in certain activities). The Group is particularly exposed to the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) introduced by the European Union in 2005, due to the quantity of free allowances granted and the cost of carbon on this market. Veolia therefore adopted an active strategy to manage its GHG emissions and allowances, by implementing an appropriate structure and creating a special-purpose legal entity to purchase, sell and price different types of greenhouse gas allowances. In 2025, the Group plans to deepen its identification and analysis of transition risks, taking into account the most appropriate scenarios, in particular the IEA NZE 2050 scenario (1).

"4.1.2.1.6 Governance of the climate commitment Governance (mitigation and adaptation) The policy for combating climate change is coordinated at the highest Group level (see section 4.1.1.4.1 above). The Board of Directors approves the Group’s strategy and makes decisions that commit the Group, such as the transition plan. It monitors the Company’s performance through the “Combating climate change” multifaceted performance indicators. Thus the emissions reduction plan targeting Net Zero with the intermediate milestone of -50% for scopes 1&2 emissions and -30% for 67% of scope 3 by 2032 was validated by the Board of Directors in December 2023. The order of deployment of the levers and the associated CapEx are validated by the Executive Management and monitored by the Finance Department. The results of climate commitments to reduce Group GHG emissions are presented annually to its Research, Innovation and Sustainable Development Committee. It is also regularly informed of Veolia’s climate change adaptation initiatives. Regarding the management of the associated climate risks, the Group’s risk map in which they are incorporated is reviewed annually by the Accounts and Audit Committee. At the Executive Committee level, two sponsors are appointed: ■Emmanuelle Menning, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance and Purchasing, sponsor of the Climate Change Mitigation commitment; ■Sébastien Daziano, Director of Strategy, Innovation and Development, sponsor of the Climate Change Adaptation approach. The Finance Department is responsible for coordinating actions linked to Group commitments to climate change mitigation. The corresponding environmental performance metrics are included in the Group’s Environmental and Industrial Management System. The Climate Change Adaptation team in the Multifaceted Performance and Sustainable Development Department coordinates, with the Risk and Insurance Department, work related to climate change adaptation and climate risk management. Progress is presented and validated by the avoidance committee, in charge of monitoring such risks and the related action plans. It comprises two Executive Committee members, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Finance and Procurement and the General Counsel as well as the Chief Risk and Insurance Officer, the Director of the Business Support & Performance department and the manager of Health and Safety Prevention for the Group. At an operational level, each Business Unit Director is responsible for breaking down the Group strategy into business opportunities and risks inherent to their business lines and region. Climate risk is identified as one of the Group’s main risks and in the Non-Financial Performance Statement. Integration of climate change performance into incentive mechanisms, as indicated in section 4.1.1.4.3 above The pay of the Group’s executives, including that of the Chief Executive Officer, is partly indexed to climate performance: ■the pay of the Chief Executive Officer, as well as that of other senior executives – in particular geographic zone executives – is indexed to climate performance. For the 2024 financial year, the variable portion related to climate performance represented 9.5% of the Chief Executive Officer’s total remuneration. ■performance shares for the Group’s executives and key contributors are also awarded based on climate performance; ■the criteria used to determine “climate performance” are: the reduction of emissions from Veolia scopes 1 and 2; the achievement of erased emissions1 targets; the progress rate of investments planned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore directly impacted by the speed of implementation of the 2030 coal exit plan. 4.1.2.1.7 Metrics Energy consumption Information on the details of the energy mix consumed and its breakdown between renewable and non-renewable energy is unavailable for this fiscal year as of the date of publication of this document.

It takes various forms, such as air, water, or soil pollution. Beyond the conventional pollutants, the development of human activities and the increasing vigilance with regard to pollution have raised awareness of the existence of new pollutants, which have only started to be analyzed and measured recently, such as microplastics, endocrine disruptors or PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The topic of pollution is therefore diverse and concerns a high number of substances, the list of which continues to grow as studies are conducted. Hazardous waste occupies a special place among the potential sources of pollution, and the Veolia group is particularly involved in its treatment. This type of waste is subject to numerous regulations, in an increasingly strict framework to regulate its handling and treatment: ■in all areas of the world where Veolia operates, a local regulatory framework defines the qualification of hazardous waste as well as the methods of traceability, transportation, treatment and disposal; ■these national regulations are supplemented in particular by the international conventions of Basel (1989), Rotterdam (1998), Stockholm (2001), Minamata (2013), and Montreal (1987); SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 204 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"■at European level, there are numerous texts governing hazardous waste: Commission Decision of May 3, 2000 establishing a list of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, Directive 2008/98/EU on hazardous waste treatment, Regulation n°2024/1157/EC for shipment, directives on electrical and electronic waste 2012/19/EU and batteries and accumulators 2006/66/EC, Directive 2012/18/EU, known as ""Seveso"", for the control of major-incident hazards, etc. More than 90% of the hazardous waste generated worldwide comes from industrial activities and Veolia contributes to treating a significant part of this volume, in particular: ■chemical industries including pharmaceutical and agrochemical: acidic or basic cleaning products, halogenated solvents, contaminated sludge, contaminated packaging, etc.; ■mechanical manufacturing, automotive industry, metal industry: waste contaminated with heavy metals, solvents, paint residues, etc.; ■oil industry: tank sludge, used catalysts, etc. In this context, Veolia has a dual role: 1. as an operator of industrial installations, Veolia is itself likely to generate pollution of air (e.g. energy production plants, incinerators, etc.), water and soil (e.g. discharge of industrial effluents, etc.); 2. at the same time, a significant part of Veolia’s activities is to reduce the impact of pollution emitted by third parties, for example: ▪Wastewater treatment, which avoids discharging pollutants released into soil, groundwater, or rivers. Veolia contributes to this activity both as a treatment plant operator and as a designer and marketer of treatment solutions, ▪or hazardous waste treatment, mainly through its role in the collection of such waste as well as its treatment in specialized installations. Point 1, above, is a central element of the ESRS E2 standard on the subject of pollution. It is addressed by IRO E2-ST-1 which is detailed in section 4.1.2.2.2 below. Point 2, above, is not one of the predetermined subjects in ESRS E2. Its particularly material nature at Veolia makes it an entity-specific subject of additional disclosure. Two IROs illustrate this point: E2-ES-2 and E2- ES-3. They are detailed in sections 4.1.2.2.3.2 and 4.1.2.2.3.3 below, respectively. Note that point 1 covers all Veolia’s operating activities, including those that contribute to depollution, such as the wastewater treatment plants or hazardous waste treatment installations mentioned above. Such installations are therefore analyzed from two complementary points of view. Other pollution-related topics are covered elsewhere in the sustainability statement: ■Emissions of pollutants in the form of GHG (carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O) are dealt with in § 4.1.2.1 Climate change, above; ■IRO E4-ES-1 and E4-ST-2 concern the interactions of pollution and depollution with biodiversity and ecosystems and are therefore detailed in section 4.1.2.4 below; ■IRO E5-ST-3 addresses the place of hazardous waste treatment in the circular economy and thus contributes to reducing the volume of pollution. It is detailed in section 4.1.2.5 below. 4.1.2.2.2 Pollution emitted by Veolia IRO E2-ST-1 is a negative impact, in assessing the gross risk represented by the installations operated by Veolia, and before taking into consideration the measures intended to ensure its control: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E2-ST-1 Pollution generated by our own activities (air, water, soil, hazardous waste, etc.) Veolia’s value chain is involved at various levels: Key stakeholders involved Value chain Upstream value chain: • Regulatory authorities: Definition of the general framework of conditions to be respected; • Administrative authorities: Limits imposed on each Installation regarding the pollution emitted; • Where applicable, the third party (e.g. municipality) responsible for the installation at which Veolia is an operating service provider: definition of the type of treatment performed and performance objectives. Downstream value chain: • The planet; • Affected communities. Business Model This IRO contributes essentially to Veolia’s business model through its environmental performance. The time frame of this IRO is twofold: ■local regulations to be strictly enforced at all times: Pollution emitted by industrial installations is subject to strict local regulations by the authorities. Veolia complies with these regulations, which concern both the maximum pollution emission thresholds and the methods of control and information. For each operating permit, these subjects require daily mobilization of all operational teams to ensure operational control; ■regulations with regularly upgraded requirements: it is necessary to adapt to new and ever more stringent requirements worldwide, typically annually (regulatory changes and new customer demands). These aspects play an even more significant role since very many sites operated by the Group are regulatory classified facilities, including at ""Seveso"" level in Europe or at equivalent level outside Europe.

"4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target Decarbonization to limit climate change In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged. Typology of greenhouse gases taken into account in Veolia’s carbon footprint Veolia mainly emits three greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are a counterpart of the essential services provided by the Group for human activities; for reference year 2021: carbon dioxide - CO2 (73% of the GHG balance), methane - CH4 (26%) and nitrous oxide - N2O (1%). Only CO2 of fossil origin is counted in the Group’s carbon balance (e.g. incinerated non-recyclable plastics), unlike CO2 of so-called “biogenic” organic origin (e.g. food residues), which is counted separately. Biogenic carbon emissions are derived from organic elements that initially captured CO2 in the atmosphere, for example through photosynthesis. They are part of a short cycle (less than 100 years) considered to be carbon neutral. On the other hand, biogenic methane is counted because of its warming potential 28 times that of CO2. In 2024, the Group emitted 5.8 of million metric tons of scope 1 biogenic CO2 and 0.2 million metric tons of scope 2 biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion, biogas, organic waste treated in incineration, and wastewater treatment. These biogenic emissions are not included in the Group’s scope 1,2 and 3 emissions. Group activities emitting greenhouse gases (GHG) Veolia decided to follow a materiality approach in terms of GHG emitting activities. Veolia only accounts for emissions related to the highest emitting activities. Thus, emissions related to office activities (for example, emissions from headquarters or those related to certain departments such as customer service) are not taken into account by Veolia, as they are considered non-significant. The issuing activities taken into account are as follows: ■District heating network management: The urban heating networks operated by the Group distribute heat to individual and industrial customers. They allow the introduction of more “decarbonable” heating overall due to concentrated energy consumption on a few installations; ■non-hazardous waste treatment: ▪waste-to-energy recovery plays a key environmental role by reducing the volume of waste to be stored, treating certain highly toxic pollutants and also treating organic waste that would produce methane, if sent directly to landfill sites. In many countries, the most recent environmental regulations tend to favor incineration over landfill. Despite these environmental benefits, incineration continues to generate significant GHG emissions, ▪storing waste in landfill sites prevents the waste from contaminating groundwater. The positive environmental, health and social impact of these installations is crucial. However, in some countries, the lack of sorting, incinerators and composting channels means that large volumes of organic waste are stored in landfills and emit large amounts of methane. ■Hazardous waste treatment: Some waste demonstrates toxicity or danger to human health or the environment. Strict regulations and traceability apply to this waste. For waste that cannot be stored or undergo physicochemical or biological treatment (hazardous waste), high-temperature incineration is a reliable and effective solution for the destruction of pollutants; ■Water treatment: By treating water to make it drinkable or by decontaminating it before it returns to the environment, Veolia provides an essential service to human activities while preserving biodiversity. Some of these treatments, especially for wastewater, are based on the replication of natural biological processes and can emit N2O or CO2. Methodology used for the classification of emissions between scopes 1, 2 and 3 Historically, the GHG emission reporting carried out by the Group presented all the emissions from the sites owned or operated by the Group in scope 1 and 2, in application of the GHG Protocol, but without making a precise distinction for operationally controlled sites in the absence of clear criteria on the concept of operational control in the available texts. As part of the implementation of the ESRS E1 standard, Veolia carried out a detailed analysis of its CO2-emitting installations, in order to present, in accordance with paragraph 46 of ESRS E1, a clear allocation of GHG emissions according to the nature of the operational control exercised. This analysis, which is consistent with the procedure principles described in Note 4.1.1.1, was led by a multidisciplinary team of operational, legal and financial staff,and was also part of the monitoring of the Group’s decarbonization plan. It relied on the regulatory reference text: the GHG Protocol, but also on specific guides such as the additional directives on operational control under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER Act) and the Methodological Guide for the Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From the Household Waste Management Service and Similar published by ADEME (2024). It also considered connectivity with the accounting analyses carried out by the Group in order to draw up its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The objective of the analysis was to address a relevant definition of the concept of operational control for Veolia’s activities. Indeed, the definition of operational control in the CSRD (in a similar way to the GHG) specifies that it exists in situations where “the company has the capacity to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation or asset”. Regarding Veolia, this definition appeared insufficient because it did not make it possible to take into account the particular nature of activities carried out in regulated environments, such as concession arrangements, or pursuant to operator contracts (“Operation and Maintenance contract”) for example. The result was the development of an operational control analysis grid, applicable to the Group’s business models specifying the elements of operational control analysis and respecting existing texts (see below). The application of this grid led to the conclusion, by type of high-emitting assets, that the emissions of: ■Merchant Plant assets (recognized as property, plant and equipment according to IAS 16) were to be classified as scope 1 and 2, with Veolia having full powers to choose policies to exploit the asset; ■Concession assets/contracts (recognized according to IFRIC 12 interpretation as either intangible assets or financial assets) were to be classified under scope 3.8 “Upstream leased assets”, with final decisions on the operating and environmental policies belonging to the licensor; ■Pure operation and maintenance contracts (recognized as service contracts) were to be classified under 3.11 as “Use of sold products”, with Veolia responding to the request of a treatment service for waste, water, etc. on the basis of a set of obligations defined and monitored by the public or private client; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 193"
"■Entities not included in the consolidation scope had to be classified under scope 3.15 “Investments”, since Veolia does not make the final decisions on operational and environmental policies. As a result, in 2023, Veolia reallocated scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-operationally controlled assets, representing 11.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2), i.e. 35% of the Group’s scope 1 and 2, to Scope 3. In addition, Veolia updated the 2021 baseline following this change in methodology, leading to a reallocation to scope 3 representing 10.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2). This methodology change does not call into question Veolia’s commitments under its GreenUp strategic program, validated by the SBTi and Moody’s: the Group is still pursuing its objective of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by -18% by 2027 and by -50% by 2032, compared with 2021, as well as a -30% reduction across at least 67% of scope 3 emissions by 2032, and finally Net Zero (-90% for scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Alongside SBTi, Veolia is preparing an update of the waypoints on its trajectory to take account of these changes in scope This new trajectory will be submitted before the summer of 2025.

It therefore depends on the energy mix of the countries in which Veolia operates. In particular, it includes emissions linked to electricity purchased for water treatment and heat losses from heating networks. When presenting its carbon footprint, Veolia uses the market-based method. Scope 2 emissions are also calculated using the so-called location-based method. For scope 2 calculations, the emission factors of the IEA (International Energy Agency) were used.

It is divided into two parts: ▪Scope 3 upstream encompasses issues related to Veolia’s purchases. For example, chemical products purchased for water treatment and fuels used for heat production. Emissions linked to assets under concession over which the Group has no operational control are also counted in scope 3 upstream (cat. 3.8). ▪Scope 3 downstream encompasses emissions related to the processing, use and end-of-life of products sold by the Group: sorted or recycled secondary materials and distributed gas. They also include emissions from operation and maintenance contracts, including those of the Hong Kong landfill sites counted in 3.11, as well as emissions related to joint ventures in 3.15. For most scope 3 elements (83%), calculations are made from business data (internal or supplier) using physical emission factors. The residual share (17%), based on expenditure data and applying monetary emission factors, should be reduced thanks to Veolia’s supplier engagement program, one focus of which is to refine the calculation of their emissions (see details of scope 3 emissions by category in section 4.1.2.1.7 Metrics). Transition plan - Key policy principles on climate change mitigation Veolia is committed to addressing the climate challenge, by acting to decarbonize Group companies and help them adapt to the changes already in place. This commitment is fully in line with its Purpose: acting to reconcile human progress and environmental protection. As a result, in 2024, the Group published its emissions reduction ambition, the result of work integrated into the preparation of its GreenUp 2024-2027 strategic program: to achieve Net Zero by 2050 by reducing its direct and indirect emissions and without the use of offset mechanisms (i.e. -90% direct and indirect emissions reduction in 2050 vs. 2021). This plan and these emissions reduction targets are the result of a long assessment of emission reduction drivers carried out thanks to the mobilization of the Group’s technical experts in all its businesses and in all its regions. It shall consider account sectoral realities, the degree of mastery of decarbonization techniques and local specificities in the countries where the Group operates. This plan is intended to be managed and enhanced beyond the GreenUp strategic program in future strategic plans that will follow after 2027. In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged.

"The Group’s action plan to reduce direct and indirect emissions in practice For nearly 10 years, the Group has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Today, Veolia is intensifying its efforts by implementing a Net Zero strategy that involves all its businesses and regions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The material IRO concerned by this issue are listed below: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-1 Significant GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3 ) requiring the implementation of a transition plan Veolia’s climate change mitigation plan is described below. This plan impacts our value chain both upstream (purchases, etc.), in operations (modification of production tools, etc.), and downstream (provision of less carbon-intensive products: energy, drinking water, etc.). These impacts will be felt in the short term during the GreenUp plan (2024-2027) and in the medium and long term as the Group embarks on major transformations of its value chain until it achieves Net Zero in 2050. Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-3 Attractiveness for financial players due to decarbonization Veolia’s decarbonization strategy, both at its own sites and those of its customers, is an attractive factor for investors looking for players with a positive impact on the climate. Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-4 Additional costs resulting from increased regulatory requirements for GHG emissions Increasing regulatory requirements for decarbonization means strengthening investments which may struggle to make a return on the basis of the activities concerned. Depending on the nature of the obligations, the financial risk may materialize in the medium or long term. Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-5 Reduction of OpEx by increasing the energy efficiency of our installations One of the decarbonization strategies implemented at sites belonging to Veolia and its customers aim to improve the profitability of the installations through the improvement of energy efficiency and the reduction of fuel or energy consumption. The associated cost reductions have a direct impact on OpEx. Scopes 1 & 2: first reduction programs started The Group is committed to achieving Net Zero by 2050 (-90% vs. 2021). To ensure the credibility of companies committing to a carbon neutrality target by 2050, the SBTi sets an intermediate milestone of 10 years from the base year (2021 for the Veolia Group). This 10-year milestone is used by the SBTi to verify the strength of commitments made by undertakings aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. The Group has therefore built its reduction strategy within this framework with a milestone of -50% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2032 compared to 2021(1). The first reduction programs launched are aimed at reaching these targets and are scheduled to run until 2032. An acceleration of the effects of the decarbonization levers is foreseeable within the framework of the next strategic plans, which will continue to reinforce the Group’s ambition in this area. This is why the trajectory for reducing scopes 1 and 2 emissions is expected to be non-linear, with the following points of transition: ■-18% in 2027 (end of the GreenUp plan) on scopes 1 and 2 vs. 2021 - Commitment made before the validation of targets to 2032 by the SBTi; ■-33% (estimated) in 2030 on scopes 1 and 2 vs. 2021, milestone set by the CSRD. This point is calculated on the basis of the 2021-2032 trend; ■-50% in 2032 for scopes 1&2 vs. 2021, intermediate milestone toward Net Zero recorded by the SBTi. To achieve its objectives, the Group is acting on several decarbonization levers listed below in order of importance to reach the target by 2032: ■Conversion of coal-fired power stations to supply heating networks in Europe with other lower-emissions energy sources (gas, biomass, SRF, waste heat and geothermal). Veolia controls the design, construction and operation of cogeneration infrastructures using alternative fuels to coal with increased efficiencies thanks to the Group’s technologies, particularly heat pump technologies. Cogeneration allows us to make the most of primary energy consumption by simultaneously producing heat and electricity in an optimized way. Cogeneration units therefore have much higher yields than conventional installations, where heat and electricity are supplied by separate units. This results in significant primary energy savings: 15% to 30%, with a reduction in CO2 emissions of 14%, 24% and 28%, respectively, compared to installations powered by gas, fuel oil or coal. Cogeneration thus guarantees better use of the fossil and non-fossil fuels used. It is a lever for energy efficiency and decarbonization. Finally, since the production of electricity from heating network plants can be controlled, it contributes to balancing the supply and demand for electricity, particularly in countries where a significant portion of production relies on intermittent renewable energy (solar and wind). ■Increased methane capture rate in non-recyclable waste landfills; ■Improved energy efficiency, enabling a reduction in fuel, heat and electricity consumption thanks to the transformation of installations and the improvement of production processes; ■Decarbonization of the energy mix of heating networks and electricity supplying the installations that Veolia operates; ■Increase in the sorting and removal of plastic before incineration for the Waste business; ■Use of vehicles with lower greenhouse gas emissions thanks to electric or hybrid engines and less carbon-intensive fuels. A large part of the financing for the Group’s decarbonization plan is already outlined in the GreenUp 2024-2027 plan, and over the following years: ■€1.6 billion accumulated by 2030 for the coal phase-out plan; ■€85 million by 2027 for the landfill methane capture plan. In addition to these large multi-year Group budgets dedicated to types of joint actions in several countries, there are also dedicated annual budget lines to finance the deployment of other levers, and in particular to reduce the carbon footprint linked to the energy consumption of the sites, thanks to: SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 196 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 (1) The 2021 baseline of the Group’s emissions is calculated pro forma by combining Veolia’s and Suez’s integrated emissions at the time of the 2021 merger. It is representative of the Group’s activities today."
"■the reduction in consumption (energy savings, energy efficiency gains, optimization of operations); ■the supply of less carbon-intensive energy through the production of renewable energy on Veolia’s sites, as well as the overall decarbonization of national electricity production networks. Thus, between 2023 and 2024, numerous additional projects for the phasing out of coal and methane capture were approved for a total amount of €120 million, thus contributing to the reduction of the Group’s carbon footprint. To select decarbonization projects, the Group relies on an in-depth multidimensional analysis involving the technical and financial services of the project-leading subsidiary and those of headquarters. In evaluating these projects, the Group requests a quantification of CO2 emissions and an associated reduction plan. For some projects, the analysis takes into account an external cost of CO2 (if it exists in the area of the project in question), but this criterion is not used systematically for all investment projects. The Group therefore does not use an internal CO2 price to decide between its various projects. Reduction driver to be implemented to divide the Group’s scopes 1 and 2 emissions by two by 2032 (vs. 2021) Scopes 1 and 2 pro forma 2021(a) 24.4 million metric tons of CO2 2032 -50% ENERGY • Fuel switch (incl. Coal exit) • Energy efficiency WASTE • Methane capture • Removal of plastics before incineration • Vehicles with lower GHG emissions • CO2 capture 12.2 million metric tons of CO2 WATER • Decarbonization of the electricity mix (a) The 2021 pro forma emissions presented here are the sum of Veolia scope emissions published in 2021 and 2021 emissions from the Suez scope acquired and retained as of the date of publication of this document. In addition, the 2021 emissions have been updated with the new method of accounting for emissions introduced in 2024 to better reflect Veolia’s operational control over GHG emissions from operated assets. The reductions in emissions by leverage are presented net of the growth of the Group’s activities. 4.1.2.1.3 Focus on coal phase-out and methane recovery plans This section refers in particular to the material IRO below: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E1-ST-2 Gradual exclusion by the financial sphere if not exiting coal-based energy production Some investors are turning away from companies using coal as fuel. Veolia has made commitments to transform its coal-fired assets in Europe in order to change fuel. The challenge of reducing GHG emissions as quickly as possible pushes governments to strengthen financial measures to encourage their sharp decrease. For about fifteen years, Veolia has been involved in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) market for its heat production plants in Europe. In addition, for several years, the financial market has gradually strengthened its policy of excluding investment and financing of assets involving coal-based energy production. The Veolia assets affected by this are largely heat production plants in Europe (Germany, Poland, Czech Republic), plus Harbin’s heating network in China. Rather than getting rid of them, the Group has chosen to adopt a responsible policy for transforming these assets. In 2018, Veolia launched a coal phase-out plan, which will enable it to fully exit this fuel in Europe by the end of 2030 and which consists of an extensive program to modify its district heating installations so as to no longer use coal as fuel. There are planned investments of €1.6 billion to exit coal in Eastern Europe between 2018 and 2030. These investments concern nine plants, three of which have already completed their transition: Braunschweig (Germany), Přerov and Kolín (Czech Republic). They will reduce the Group’s carbon footprint by 3.5 million metric tons of CO2 eq. by replacing coal with a less carbon-intensive mix including gas, biomass and heat pumps. As regards China’s heating networks, decarbonization is a real challenge given China’s dependence on coal and Veolia is continuing its discussions with Chinese authorities to find solutions. Without waiting for this obstacle to be lifted, Veolia is actively working to activate all available decarbonization levers through optimization and performance action plans. Thus, on its main heating network in Harbin, the Group has already achieved significant results with a 30% reduction in carbon intensity between 2012 and 2024. The program implemented aims for a 25% GHG emissions reduction by 2032. Progress of the coal phase-out plan in Europe The investment budget by 2030 is €1.6 billion, of which €656 million had already been invested at the end of 2024. The expected emissions reduction is as follows: ■200 kt CO2 in Germany, in relation to the already completed Braunschweig project; ■880 kt CO2 in the Czech Republic: Přerov, and Kolín which started in 2023-2024; ■2,435 kt CO2 in Poland. 2024 saw the completion of the major Poznań project, which is scheduled to start up in 2025. Progress of the GreenUp methane plan In 2024, €7 million were invested and the Group’s average capture rate increased from 58.5% in 2023 to 59.8% in 2024. Methane capture improvement is being deployed by the Group throughout its zones and in particular in Latin America, France and Australia. 2021 2024 Target 2032 CH4: Average methane capture rate (in %) (current scope) 56.3 % 59.8 % 80.0 % SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 197"
"In addition to these initiatives and in a more systemic approach, the work to assess operational risks (direct and across the entire value chain) related to climate change is structured, at all levels of the organization, around: ■analysis of operating asset exposure; ■understanding activity vulnerabilities; ■identification and deployment of adaptation actions. ANALYSE THE EXPOSURE OF OPERATIONAL ASSETS How will weather conditions evolve according to the available projections? UNDERSTAND ASSET VULNERABILITIES What impacts can climate change have on the industrial processes of activities? ASSESSMENT PROCESS ROLL OUT ADAPTATION MEASURES BASED ON VEOLIA TEAM'S EXPERTISE AND KNOW-HOW What actions can Veolia implement over the duration of the contract and beyond? In 2022 and 2023, the Group carried out an analysis of exposure to physical climate risks at more than 2,000 operational sites(1). This analysis, based on the RCP 8.5(2) scenario by 2030 and 2050, covered 7 types of potentially impactful climate hazards(3): heatwaves and cold spells, drought, heavy rains, changes in the water cycle, rising average temperatures and rising sea level. The criteria of data availability and reliability were also considered in the choice of metrics studied. This work, carried out jointly by the internal audit, risk and insurance, and sustainable development departments, has made it possible to identify the geographical areas of priority operations for adaptation efforts: Australia/New Zealand, United States, Colombia/Panama, Chile/Peru, France, Czech Republic, Spain, Morocco, and countries in the Near and Middle East. In addition, vulnerability studies are conducted on site to strengthen understanding of operational risks related to climate change (direct and across the entire value chain). Based on the Operational Climate Adaptation & Resilience Assessment (OCARA) framework developed by Carbone 4, these studies contribute to the identification and deployment of targeted adaptation actions. They include local climate projection data (e.g. Data from DRIAS and Météo France, in France). The hazards, time- frames and projection scenarios (at least the RCP8.5 scenario) studied are adapted to the challenges of the site (e.g. taking into account specific hazards such as high winds, shrinkage/swelling of clays, forest fires, etc. or time-frames defined in line with the duration of contracts or the lifetime of the installations). Since 2022, more than 20 on-site studies have been carried out (including 10 in 2024), mainly in regions with priority operations (United States, Australia, Taiwan, France, Spain), and on the Water and Waste businesses. The aim is to extend these studies to all of the Group’s activities and regions. A study lasts on average between two and six months. Capitalization on the work carried out since 2022 and the expertise of Veolia’s teams contribute to the development of tools or benchmarks such as vulnerability profiles and adaptation solution catalogs, by activity. Currently, these benchmarks cover: ■drinking water production and distribution; ■wastewater collection and treatment; ■as well as the management of non-hazardous waste (sorting, incineration and landfill). In 2025, the scope of these benchmarks will be expanded to include energy production and distribution, waste collection and hazardous waste treatment. These tools are resources for local entities (Business Units and operating sites) which will be able to identify adaptation measures and launch action plans to strengthen their resilience and that of their customers. The effective deployment of the Group’s action plans faces two main challenges: ■the availability of the necessary resources and means from its clients for their implementation; ■and the time lag between long-term climate scenarios (2050, 2100) and shorter-term investment cycles. Highlighting the concrete benefits of adaptation in terms of finance, personnel health and industrial safety remains key to facilitating decision- making and engaging all stakeholders. In 2025, the Group plans to launch work on the methodology for assessing the financial consequences of climate change. They will build on the study of the phenomena already observed and the vulnerability of the installations by integrating short, medium and long-term climate projections.

"The table below provides a frame of reference for translating the impacts of climate change into operational impacts for the Drinking Water business. Climate Risk Examples of operational vulnerabilities identified Examples of adaptation measures for the water business Heatwaves • Maintaining indoor and outdoor working conditions (productivity, health, and safety risks); • Damage to sensitive equipment (electronic and electrical); • Delays to work schedules; • Degradation of water quality due to proliferation of algae; • Water demand pressures and worsening conflicts over use; • Rising costs of energy to maintain operating temperatures; • Increased risk of fires and explosions. • Reorganize work schedules; • Improve insulation against cold/heat in buildings; • Systematically build redundancy into cooling equipment for critical applications; • Provide personal protective equipment (PPE) suitable for high temperatures; • Improve hydrogen sulfide monitoring. Heavy rains • Damage to sensitive equipment (electronic and electrical); • Pollution thresholds exceeded; • Disruption to supply chains and transportation services (preventing response to callouts); • Turbidity degrading water quality; • Facilities for treating wastewater and rainwater overwhelmed. • Raise the height of equipment based on extremes; • Prioritize emergency warning systems; • Build redundancy into electrical supply equipment; • Improved waterproofing of critical equipment; • Work with sanitation services before heavy rains occur to clear traffic lanes. Drought • Scarcity of water resources impacting the production and distribution of drinking water, and cooling requirements; • Degradation of water quality creating the need for additional treatment and/or larger facilities; • Clay shrinkage and swelling causing infrastructure damage in clay soil areas. • Ensure adequate reagent storage; • Install water reuse solutions; • Resize facilities to accommodate the additional treatments; • Prioritize redundancy in local resources and networking in collaboration with local stakeholders. Management of transition risks Combating climate change requires the transition to a low-carbon economy. While generating significant business opportunities for the Group, this transition may also give rise to a number of risks. These transition risks can take many forms: regulatory, technological, market, reputation. In 2020, the Group conducted a study on the resilience of its business model and its associated strategy, including two low-carbon transition scenarios (<2°C) by 2030. This has made it possible to target the risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy (e.g. carbon markets, withdrawal from thermal coal, reduction in landfill, heat production, electrification, reduction in certain activities). The Group is particularly exposed to the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) introduced by the European Union in 2005, due to the quantity of free allowances granted and the cost of carbon on this market. Veolia therefore adopted an active strategy to manage its GHG emissions and allowances, by implementing an appropriate structure and creating a special-purpose legal entity to purchase, sell and price different types of greenhouse gas allowances. In 2025, the Group plans to deepen its identification and analysis of transition risks, taking into account the most appropriate scenarios, in particular the IEA NZE 2050 scenario (1).

"4.1.2.1.6 Governance of the climate commitment Governance (mitigation and adaptation) The policy for combating climate change is coordinated at the highest Group level (see section 4.1.1.4.1 above). The Board of Directors approves the Group’s strategy and makes decisions that commit the Group, such as the transition plan. It monitors the Company’s performance through the “Combating climate change” multifaceted performance indicators. Thus the emissions reduction plan targeting Net Zero with the intermediate milestone of -50% for scopes 1&2 emissions and -30% for 67% of scope 3 by 2032 was validated by the Board of Directors in December 2023. The order of deployment of the levers and the associated CapEx are validated by the Executive Management and monitored by the Finance Department. The results of climate commitments to reduce Group GHG emissions are presented annually to its Research, Innovation and Sustainable Development Committee. It is also regularly informed of Veolia’s climate change adaptation initiatives. Regarding the management of the associated climate risks, the Group’s risk map in which they are incorporated is reviewed annually by the Accounts and Audit Committee. At the Executive Committee level, two sponsors are appointed: ■Emmanuelle Menning, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance and Purchasing, sponsor of the Climate Change Mitigation commitment; ■Sébastien Daziano, Director of Strategy, Innovation and Development, sponsor of the Climate Change Adaptation approach. The Finance Department is responsible for coordinating actions linked to Group commitments to climate change mitigation. The corresponding environmental performance metrics are included in the Group’s Environmental and Industrial Management System. The Climate Change Adaptation team in the Multifaceted Performance and Sustainable Development Department coordinates, with the Risk and Insurance Department, work related to climate change adaptation and climate risk management. Progress is presented and validated by the avoidance committee, in charge of monitoring such risks and the related action plans. It comprises two Executive Committee members, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Finance and Procurement and the General Counsel as well as the Chief Risk and Insurance Officer, the Director of the Business Support & Performance department and the manager of Health and Safety Prevention for the Group. At an operational level, each Business Unit Director is responsible for breaking down the Group strategy into business opportunities and risks inherent to their business lines and region. Climate risk is identified as one of the Group’s main risks and in the Non-Financial Performance Statement. Integration of climate change performance into incentive mechanisms, as indicated in section 4.1.1.4.3 above The pay of the Group’s executives, including that of the Chief Executive Officer, is partly indexed to climate performance: ■the pay of the Chief Executive Officer, as well as that of other senior executives – in particular geographic zone executives – is indexed to climate performance. For the 2024 financial year, the variable portion related to climate performance represented 9.5% of the Chief Executive Officer’s total remuneration. ■performance shares for the Group’s executives and key contributors are also awarded based on climate performance; ■the criteria used to determine “climate performance” are: the reduction of emissions from Veolia scopes 1 and 2; the achievement of erased emissions1 targets; the progress rate of investments planned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore directly impacted by the speed of implementation of the 2030 coal exit plan. 4.1.2.1.7 Metrics Energy consumption Information on the details of the energy mix consumed and its breakdown between renewable and non-renewable energy is unavailable for this fiscal year as of the date of publication of this document.

It takes various forms, such as air, water, or soil pollution. Beyond the conventional pollutants, the development of human activities and the increasing vigilance with regard to pollution have raised awareness of the existence of new pollutants, which have only started to be analyzed and measured recently, such as microplastics, endocrine disruptors or PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The topic of pollution is therefore diverse and concerns a high number of substances, the list of which continues to grow as studies are conducted. Hazardous waste occupies a special place among the potential sources of pollution, and the Veolia group is particularly involved in its treatment. This type of waste is subject to numerous regulations, in an increasingly strict framework to regulate its handling and treatment: ■in all areas of the world where Veolia operates, a local regulatory framework defines the qualification of hazardous waste as well as the methods of traceability, transportation, treatment and disposal; ■these national regulations are supplemented in particular by the international conventions of Basel (1989), Rotterdam (1998), Stockholm (2001), Minamata (2013), and Montreal (1987); SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 204 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"■at European level, there are numerous texts governing hazardous waste: Commission Decision of May 3, 2000 establishing a list of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, Directive 2008/98/EU on hazardous waste treatment, Regulation n°2024/1157/EC for shipment, directives on electrical and electronic waste 2012/19/EU and batteries and accumulators 2006/66/EC, Directive 2012/18/EU, known as ""Seveso"", for the control of major-incident hazards, etc. More than 90% of the hazardous waste generated worldwide comes from industrial activities and Veolia contributes to treating a significant part of this volume, in particular: ■chemical industries including pharmaceutical and agrochemical: acidic or basic cleaning products, halogenated solvents, contaminated sludge, contaminated packaging, etc.; ■mechanical manufacturing, automotive industry, metal industry: waste contaminated with heavy metals, solvents, paint residues, etc.; ■oil industry: tank sludge, used catalysts, etc. In this context, Veolia has a dual role: 1. as an operator of industrial installations, Veolia is itself likely to generate pollution of air (e.g. energy production plants, incinerators, etc.), water and soil (e.g. discharge of industrial effluents, etc.); 2. at the same time, a significant part of Veolia’s activities is to reduce the impact of pollution emitted by third parties, for example: ▪Wastewater treatment, which avoids discharging pollutants released into soil, groundwater, or rivers. Veolia contributes to this activity both as a treatment plant operator and as a designer and marketer of treatment solutions, ▪or hazardous waste treatment, mainly through its role in the collection of such waste as well as its treatment in specialized installations. Point 1, above, is a central element of the ESRS E2 standard on the subject of pollution. It is addressed by IRO E2-ST-1 which is detailed in section 4.1.2.2.2 below. Point 2, above, is not one of the predetermined subjects in ESRS E2. Its particularly material nature at Veolia makes it an entity-specific subject of additional disclosure. Two IROs illustrate this point: E2-ES-2 and E2- ES-3. They are detailed in sections 4.1.2.2.3.2 and 4.1.2.2.3.3 below, respectively. Note that point 1 covers all Veolia’s operating activities, including those that contribute to depollution, such as the wastewater treatment plants or hazardous waste treatment installations mentioned above. Such installations are therefore analyzed from two complementary points of view. Other pollution-related topics are covered elsewhere in the sustainability statement: ■Emissions of pollutants in the form of GHG (carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O) are dealt with in § 4.1.2.1 Climate change, above; ■IRO E4-ES-1 and E4-ST-2 concern the interactions of pollution and depollution with biodiversity and ecosystems and are therefore detailed in section 4.1.2.4 below; ■IRO E5-ST-3 addresses the place of hazardous waste treatment in the circular economy and thus contributes to reducing the volume of pollution. It is detailed in section 4.1.2.5 below. 4.1.2.2.2 Pollution emitted by Veolia IRO E2-ST-1 is a negative impact, in assessing the gross risk represented by the installations operated by Veolia, and before taking into consideration the measures intended to ensure its control: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E2-ST-1 Pollution generated by our own activities (air, water, soil, hazardous waste, etc.) Veolia’s value chain is involved at various levels: Key stakeholders involved Value chain Upstream value chain: • Regulatory authorities: Definition of the general framework of conditions to be respected; • Administrative authorities: Limits imposed on each Installation regarding the pollution emitted; • Where applicable, the third party (e.g. municipality) responsible for the installation at which Veolia is an operating service provider: definition of the type of treatment performed and performance objectives. Downstream value chain: • The planet; • Affected communities. Business Model This IRO contributes essentially to Veolia’s business model through its environmental performance. The time frame of this IRO is twofold: ■local regulations to be strictly enforced at all times: Pollution emitted by industrial installations is subject to strict local regulations by the authorities. Veolia complies with these regulations, which concern both the maximum pollution emission thresholds and the methods of control and information. For each operating permit, these subjects require daily mobilization of all operational teams to ensure operational control; ■regulations with regularly upgraded requirements: it is necessary to adapt to new and ever more stringent requirements worldwide, typically annually (regulatory changes and new customer demands). These aspects play an even more significant role since very many sites operated by the Group are regulatory classified facilities, including at ""Seveso"" level in Europe or at equivalent level outside Europe.

It involves physical risks to which Veolia and its customers must adapt. The necessary transition to a low-carbon economy generates risks, particularly financial risks linked to project costs, but also opportunities by allowing the Group to stand out from its competitors. These dynamics also bring commercial opportunities for the Group, particularly in the decarbonization of its customers. Climate change occupies an important place in Veolia’s material issues and the materiality analysis set out in section 4.1.1.7 above led to the identification of no fewer than eight material IRO concerning the ESRS E1 standard. This section addresses the issues of climate change in terms of its mitigation as well as adaptation to this change: Climate change mitigation Group GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target and § 4.1.2.1.3 Focus on coal phase-out and methane recovery plans Third Party GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.4 Helping customers decarbonize Climate change adaptation § 4.1.2.1.5 Climate change adaptation SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 192 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target Decarbonization to limit climate change In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged. Typology of greenhouse gases taken into account in Veolia’s carbon footprint Veolia mainly emits three greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are a counterpart of the essential services provided by the Group for human activities; for reference year 2021: carbon dioxide - CO2 (73% of the GHG balance), methane - CH4 (26%) and nitrous oxide - N2O (1%). Only CO2 of fossil origin is counted in the Group’s carbon balance (e.g. incinerated non-recyclable plastics), unlike CO2 of so-called “biogenic” organic origin (e.g. food residues), which is counted separately. Biogenic carbon emissions are derived from organic elements that initially captured CO2 in the atmosphere, for example through photosynthesis. They are part of a short cycle (less than 100 years) considered to be carbon neutral. On the other hand, biogenic methane is counted because of its warming potential 28 times that of CO2. In 2024, the Group emitted 5.8 of million metric tons of scope 1 biogenic CO2 and 0.2 million metric tons of scope 2 biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion, biogas, organic waste treated in incineration, and wastewater treatment. These biogenic emissions are not included in the Group’s scope 1,2 and 3 emissions. Group activities emitting greenhouse gases (GHG) Veolia decided to follow a materiality approach in terms of GHG emitting activities. Veolia only accounts for emissions related to the highest emitting activities. Thus, emissions related to office activities (for example, emissions from headquarters or those related to certain departments such as customer service) are not taken into account by Veolia, as they are considered non-significant. The issuing activities taken into account are as follows: ■District heating network management: The urban heating networks operated by the Group distribute heat to individual and industrial customers. They allow the introduction of more “decarbonable” heating overall due to concentrated energy consumption on a few installations; ■non-hazardous waste treatment: ▪waste-to-energy recovery plays a key environmental role by reducing the volume of waste to be stored, treating certain highly toxic pollutants and also treating organic waste that would produce methane, if sent directly to landfill sites. In many countries, the most recent environmental regulations tend to favor incineration over landfill. Despite these environmental benefits, incineration continues to generate significant GHG emissions, ▪storing waste in landfill sites prevents the waste from contaminating groundwater. The positive environmental, health and social impact of these installations is crucial. However, in some countries, the lack of sorting, incinerators and composting channels means that large volumes of organic waste are stored in landfills and emit large amounts of methane. ■Hazardous waste treatment: Some waste demonstrates toxicity or danger to human health or the environment. Strict regulations and traceability apply to this waste. For waste that cannot be stored or undergo physicochemical or biological treatment (hazardous waste), high-temperature incineration is a reliable and effective solution for the destruction of pollutants; ■Water treatment: By treating water to make it drinkable or by decontaminating it before it returns to the environment, Veolia provides an essential service to human activities while preserving biodiversity. Some of these treatments, especially for wastewater, are based on the replication of natural biological processes and can emit N2O or CO2. Methodology used for the classification of emissions between scopes 1, 2 and 3 Historically, the GHG emission reporting carried out by the Group presented all the emissions from the sites owned or operated by the Group in scope 1 and 2, in application of the GHG Protocol, but without making a precise distinction for operationally controlled sites in the absence of clear criteria on the concept of operational control in the available texts. As part of the implementation of the ESRS E1 standard, Veolia carried out a detailed analysis of its CO2-emitting installations, in order to present, in accordance with paragraph 46 of ESRS E1, a clear allocation of GHG emissions according to the nature of the operational control exercised. This analysis, which is consistent with the procedure principles described in Note 4.1.1.1, was led by a multidisciplinary team of operational, legal and financial staff,and was also part of the monitoring of the Group’s decarbonization plan. It relied on the regulatory reference text: the GHG Protocol, but also on specific guides such as the additional directives on operational control under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER Act) and the Methodological Guide for the Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From the Household Waste Management Service and Similar published by ADEME (2024). It also considered connectivity with the accounting analyses carried out by the Group in order to draw up its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The objective of the analysis was to address a relevant definition of the concept of operational control for Veolia’s activities. Indeed, the definition of operational control in the CSRD (in a similar way to the GHG) specifies that it exists in situations where “the company has the capacity to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation or asset”. Regarding Veolia, this definition appeared insufficient because it did not make it possible to take into account the particular nature of activities carried out in regulated environments, such as concession arrangements, or pursuant to operator contracts (“Operation and Maintenance contract”) for example. The result was the development of an operational control analysis grid, applicable to the Group’s business models specifying the elements of operational control analysis and respecting existing texts (see below). The application of this grid led to the conclusion, by type of high-emitting assets, that the emissions of: ■Merchant Plant assets (recognized as property, plant and equipment according to IAS 16) were to be classified as scope 1 and 2, with Veolia having full powers to choose policies to exploit the asset; ■Concession assets/contracts (recognized according to IFRIC 12 interpretation as either intangible assets or financial assets) were to be classified under scope 3.8 “Upstream leased assets”, with final decisions on the operating and environmental policies belonging to the licensor; ■Pure operation and maintenance contracts (recognized as service contracts) were to be classified under 3.11 as “Use of sold products”, with Veolia responding to the request of a treatment service for waste, water, etc. on the basis of a set of obligations defined and monitored by the public or private client; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 193"
"■Entities not included in the consolidation scope had to be classified under scope 3.15 “Investments”, since Veolia does not make the final decisions on operational and environmental policies. As a result, in 2023, Veolia reallocated scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-operationally controlled assets, representing 11.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2), i.e. 35% of the Group’s scope 1 and 2, to Scope 3. In addition, Veolia updated the 2021 baseline following this change in methodology, leading to a reallocation to scope 3 representing 10.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2). This methodology change does not call into question Veolia’s commitments under its GreenUp strategic program, validated by the SBTi and Moody’s: the Group is still pursuing its objective of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by -18% by 2027 and by -50% by 2032, compared with 2021, as well as a -30% reduction across at least 67% of scope 3 emissions by 2032, and finally Net Zero (-90% for scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Alongside SBTi, Veolia is preparing an update of the waypoints on its trajectory to take account of these changes in scope This new trajectory will be submitted before the summer of 2025.

It therefore depends on the energy mix of the countries in which Veolia operates. In particular, it includes emissions linked to electricity purchased for water treatment and heat losses from heating networks. When presenting its carbon footprint, Veolia uses the market-based method. Scope 2 emissions are also calculated using the so-called location-based method. For scope 2 calculations, the emission factors of the IEA (International Energy Agency) were used.

Biogenic carbon emissions are derived from organic elements that initially captured CO2 in the atmosphere, for example through photosynthesis. They are part of a short cycle (less than 100 years) considered to be carbon neutral. On the other hand, biogenic methane is counted because of its warming potential 28 times that of CO2. In 2024, the Group emitted 5.8 of million metric tons of scope 1 biogenic CO2 and 0.2 million metric tons of scope 2 biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion, biogas, organic waste treated in incineration, and wastewater treatment. These biogenic emissions are not included in the Group’s scope 1,2 and 3 emissions. Group activities emitting greenhouse gases (GHG) Veolia decided to follow a materiality approach in terms of GHG emitting activities. Veolia only accounts for emissions related to the highest emitting activities. Thus, emissions related to office activities (for example, emissions from headquarters or those related to certain departments such as customer service) are not taken into account by Veolia, as they are considered non-significant. The issuing activities taken into account are as follows: ■District heating network management: The urban heating networks operated by the Group distribute heat to individual and industrial customers. They allow the introduction of more “decarbonable” heating overall due to concentrated energy consumption on a few installations; ■non-hazardous waste treatment: ▪waste-to-energy recovery plays a key environmental role by reducing the volume of waste to be stored, treating certain highly toxic pollutants and also treating organic waste that would produce methane, if sent directly to landfill sites. In many countries, the most recent environmental regulations tend to favor incineration over landfill. Despite these environmental benefits, incineration continues to generate significant GHG emissions, ▪storing waste in landfill sites prevents the waste from contaminating groundwater. The positive environmental, health and social impact of these installations is crucial. However, in some countries, the lack of sorting, incinerators and composting channels means that large volumes of organic waste are stored in landfills and emit large amounts of methane. ■Hazardous waste treatment: Some waste demonstrates toxicity or danger to human health or the environment. Strict regulations and traceability apply to this waste. For waste that cannot be stored or undergo physicochemical or biological treatment (hazardous waste), high-temperature incineration is a reliable and effective solution for the destruction of pollutants; ■Water treatment: By treating water to make it drinkable or by decontaminating it before it returns to the environment, Veolia provides an essential service to human activities while preserving biodiversity. Some of these treatments, especially for wastewater, are based on the replication of natural biological processes and can emit N2O or CO2. Methodology used for the classification of emissions between scopes 1, 2 and 3 Historically, the GHG emission reporting carried out by the Group presented all the emissions from the sites owned or operated by the Group in scope 1 and 2, in application of the GHG Protocol, but without making a precise distinction for operationally controlled sites in the absence of clear criteria on the concept of operational control in the available texts. As part of the implementation of the ESRS E1 standard, Veolia carried out a detailed analysis of its CO2-emitting installations, in order to present, in accordance with paragraph 46 of ESRS E1, a clear allocation of GHG emissions according to the nature of the operational control exercised. This analysis, which is consistent with the procedure principles described in Note 4.1.1.1, was led by a multidisciplinary team of operational, legal and financial staff,and was also part of the monitoring of the Group’s decarbonization plan. It relied on the regulatory reference text: the GHG Protocol, but also on specific guides such as the additional directives on operational control under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER Act) and the Methodological Guide for the Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From the Household Waste Management Service and Similar published by ADEME (2024). It also considered connectivity with the accounting analyses carried out by the Group in order to draw up its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The objective of the analysis was to address a relevant definition of the concept of operational control for Veolia’s activities. Indeed, the definition of operational control in the CSRD (in a similar way to the GHG) specifies that it exists in situations where “the company has the capacity to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation or asset”. Regarding Veolia, this definition appeared insufficient because it did not make it possible to take into account the particular nature of activities carried out in regulated environments, such as concession arrangements, or pursuant to operator contracts (“Operation and Maintenance contract”) for example. The result was the development of an operational control analysis grid, applicable to the Group’s business models specifying the elements of operational control analysis and respecting existing texts (see below). The application of this grid led to the conclusion, by type of high-emitting assets, that the emissions of: ■Merchant Plant assets (recognized as property, plant and equipment according to IAS 16) were to be classified as scope 1 and 2, with Veolia having full powers to choose policies to exploit the asset; ■Concession assets/contracts (recognized according to IFRIC 12 interpretation as either intangible assets or financial assets) were to be classified under scope 3.8 “Upstream leased assets”, with final decisions on the operating and environmental policies belonging to the licensor; ■Pure operation and maintenance contracts (recognized as service contracts) were to be classified under 3.11 as “Use of sold products”, with Veolia responding to the request of a treatment service for waste, water, etc. on the basis of a set of obligations defined and monitored by the public or private client; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 193"
"■Entities not included in the consolidation scope had to be classified under scope 3.15 “Investments”, since Veolia does not make the final decisions on operational and environmental policies. As a result, in 2023, Veolia reallocated scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-operationally controlled assets, representing 11.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2), i.e. 35% of the Group’s scope 1 and 2, to Scope 3. In addition, Veolia updated the 2021 baseline following this change in methodology, leading to a reallocation to scope 3 representing 10.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2). This methodology change does not call into question Veolia’s commitments under its GreenUp strategic program, validated by the SBTi and Moody’s: the Group is still pursuing its objective of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by -18% by 2027 and by -50% by 2032, compared with 2021, as well as a -30% reduction across at least 67% of scope 3 emissions by 2032, and finally Net Zero (-90% for scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Alongside SBTi, Veolia is preparing an update of the waypoints on its trajectory to take account of these changes in scope This new trajectory will be submitted before the summer of 2025.

It involves physical risks to which Veolia and its customers must adapt. The necessary transition to a low-carbon economy generates risks, particularly financial risks linked to project costs, but also opportunities by allowing the Group to stand out from its competitors. These dynamics also bring commercial opportunities for the Group, particularly in the decarbonization of its customers. Climate change occupies an important place in Veolia’s material issues and the materiality analysis set out in section 4.1.1.7 above led to the identification of no fewer than eight material IRO concerning the ESRS E1 standard. This section addresses the issues of climate change in terms of its mitigation as well as adaptation to this change: Climate change mitigation Group GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target and § 4.1.2.1.3 Focus on coal phase-out and methane recovery plans Third Party GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.4 Helping customers decarbonize Climate change adaptation § 4.1.2.1.5 Climate change adaptation SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 192 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target Decarbonization to limit climate change In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged.

It involves physical risks to which Veolia and its customers must adapt. The necessary transition to a low-carbon economy generates risks, particularly financial risks linked to project costs, but also opportunities by allowing the Group to stand out from its competitors. These dynamics also bring commercial opportunities for the Group, particularly in the decarbonization of its customers. Climate change occupies an important place in Veolia’s material issues and the materiality analysis set out in section 4.1.1.7 above led to the identification of no fewer than eight material IRO concerning the ESRS E1 standard. This section addresses the issues of climate change in terms of its mitigation as well as adaptation to this change: Climate change mitigation Group GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target and § 4.1.2.1.3 Focus on coal phase-out and methane recovery plans Third Party GHG emissions: § 4.1.2.1.4 Helping customers decarbonize Climate change adaptation § 4.1.2.1.5 Climate change adaptation SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 192 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"4.1.2.1.2 Aligning Veolia’s trajectory with the 1.5°C target Decarbonization to limit climate change In July 2024, the SBTi approved Veolia’s short-term emissions reduction targets for 2032 (-50% for scopes 1 and 2 and -30% for at least 67% of scope 3 by 2032 compared to 2021) and recorded the Group’s commitment to reduce its long-term emissions to meet the target of zero net emissions by 2050. This commitment (Net Zero by 2050) is in line with the ambition of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century (IPCC SSP1-1.9 scenario). Veolia’s transition plan has also obtained a NZ2 score according to Moody’s Net Zero Assessment (NZA). Following the methodological changes in the accounting of emissions (see above), the Group will submit its new trajectory to the SBTi in the first half of 2025. The Group’s commitments in terms of the percentage reduction of scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2032 and 2050 remain unchanged. Typology of greenhouse gases taken into account in Veolia’s carbon footprint Veolia mainly emits three greenhouse gases (GHGs) which are a counterpart of the essential services provided by the Group for human activities; for reference year 2021: carbon dioxide - CO2 (73% of the GHG balance), methane - CH4 (26%) and nitrous oxide - N2O (1%). Only CO2 of fossil origin is counted in the Group’s carbon balance (e.g. incinerated non-recyclable plastics), unlike CO2 of so-called “biogenic” organic origin (e.g. food residues), which is counted separately. Biogenic carbon emissions are derived from organic elements that initially captured CO2 in the atmosphere, for example through photosynthesis. They are part of a short cycle (less than 100 years) considered to be carbon neutral. On the other hand, biogenic methane is counted because of its warming potential 28 times that of CO2. In 2024, the Group emitted 5.8 of million metric tons of scope 1 biogenic CO2 and 0.2 million metric tons of scope 2 biogenic CO2 from biomass combustion, biogas, organic waste treated in incineration, and wastewater treatment. These biogenic emissions are not included in the Group’s scope 1,2 and 3 emissions. Group activities emitting greenhouse gases (GHG) Veolia decided to follow a materiality approach in terms of GHG emitting activities. Veolia only accounts for emissions related to the highest emitting activities. Thus, emissions related to office activities (for example, emissions from headquarters or those related to certain departments such as customer service) are not taken into account by Veolia, as they are considered non-significant. The issuing activities taken into account are as follows: ■District heating network management: The urban heating networks operated by the Group distribute heat to individual and industrial customers. They allow the introduction of more “decarbonable” heating overall due to concentrated energy consumption on a few installations; ■non-hazardous waste treatment: ▪waste-to-energy recovery plays a key environmental role by reducing the volume of waste to be stored, treating certain highly toxic pollutants and also treating organic waste that would produce methane, if sent directly to landfill sites. In many countries, the most recent environmental regulations tend to favor incineration over landfill. Despite these environmental benefits, incineration continues to generate significant GHG emissions, ▪storing waste in landfill sites prevents the waste from contaminating groundwater. The positive environmental, health and social impact of these installations is crucial. However, in some countries, the lack of sorting, incinerators and composting channels means that large volumes of organic waste are stored in landfills and emit large amounts of methane. ■Hazardous waste treatment: Some waste demonstrates toxicity or danger to human health or the environment. Strict regulations and traceability apply to this waste. For waste that cannot be stored or undergo physicochemical or biological treatment (hazardous waste), high-temperature incineration is a reliable and effective solution for the destruction of pollutants; ■Water treatment: By treating water to make it drinkable or by decontaminating it before it returns to the environment, Veolia provides an essential service to human activities while preserving biodiversity. Some of these treatments, especially for wastewater, are based on the replication of natural biological processes and can emit N2O or CO2. Methodology used for the classification of emissions between scopes 1, 2 and 3 Historically, the GHG emission reporting carried out by the Group presented all the emissions from the sites owned or operated by the Group in scope 1 and 2, in application of the GHG Protocol, but without making a precise distinction for operationally controlled sites in the absence of clear criteria on the concept of operational control in the available texts. As part of the implementation of the ESRS E1 standard, Veolia carried out a detailed analysis of its CO2-emitting installations, in order to present, in accordance with paragraph 46 of ESRS E1, a clear allocation of GHG emissions according to the nature of the operational control exercised. This analysis, which is consistent with the procedure principles described in Note 4.1.1.1, was led by a multidisciplinary team of operational, legal and financial staff,and was also part of the monitoring of the Group’s decarbonization plan. It relied on the regulatory reference text: the GHG Protocol, but also on specific guides such as the additional directives on operational control under the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER Act) and the Methodological Guide for the Evaluation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions From the Household Waste Management Service and Similar published by ADEME (2024). It also considered connectivity with the accounting analyses carried out by the Group in order to draw up its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The objective of the analysis was to address a relevant definition of the concept of operational control for Veolia’s activities. Indeed, the definition of operational control in the CSRD (in a similar way to the GHG) specifies that it exists in situations where “the company has the capacity to direct the operational activities and relationships of the entity, site, operation or asset”. Regarding Veolia, this definition appeared insufficient because it did not make it possible to take into account the particular nature of activities carried out in regulated environments, such as concession arrangements, or pursuant to operator contracts (“Operation and Maintenance contract”) for example. The result was the development of an operational control analysis grid, applicable to the Group’s business models specifying the elements of operational control analysis and respecting existing texts (see below). The application of this grid led to the conclusion, by type of high-emitting assets, that the emissions of: ■Merchant Plant assets (recognized as property, plant and equipment according to IAS 16) were to be classified as scope 1 and 2, with Veolia having full powers to choose policies to exploit the asset; ■Concession assets/contracts (recognized according to IFRIC 12 interpretation as either intangible assets or financial assets) were to be classified under scope 3.8 “Upstream leased assets”, with final decisions on the operating and environmental policies belonging to the licensor; ■Pure operation and maintenance contracts (recognized as service contracts) were to be classified under 3.11 as “Use of sold products”, with Veolia responding to the request of a treatment service for waste, water, etc. on the basis of a set of obligations defined and monitored by the public or private client; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 193"
"■Entities not included in the consolidation scope had to be classified under scope 3.15 “Investments”, since Veolia does not make the final decisions on operational and environmental policies. As a result, in 2023, Veolia reallocated scope 1 and 2 emissions from non-operationally controlled assets, representing 11.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2), i.e. 35% of the Group’s scope 1 and 2, to Scope 3. In addition, Veolia updated the 2021 baseline following this change in methodology, leading to a reallocation to scope 3 representing 10.9 million metric tons of emissions (scope 1 and 2). This methodology change does not call into question Veolia’s commitments under its GreenUp strategic program, validated by the SBTi and Moody’s: the Group is still pursuing its objective of reducing its scope 1 and 2 emissions by -18% by 2027 and by -50% by 2032, compared with 2021, as well as a -30% reduction across at least 67% of scope 3 emissions by 2032, and finally Net Zero (-90% for scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. Alongside SBTi, Veolia is preparing an update of the waypoints on its trajectory to take account of these changes in scope This new trajectory will be submitted before the summer of 2025.

It therefore depends on the energy mix of the countries in which Veolia operates. In particular, it includes emissions linked to electricity purchased for water treatment and heat losses from heating networks. When presenting its carbon footprint, Veolia uses the market-based method. Scope 2 emissions are also calculated using the so-called location-based method. For scope 2 calculations, the emission factors of the IEA (International Energy Agency) were used.

Management of transition risks Combating climate change requires the transition to a low-carbon economy. While generating significant business opportunities for the Group, this transition may also give rise to a number of risks. These transition risks can take many forms: regulatory, technological, market, reputation. In 2020, the Group conducted a study on the resilience of its business model and its associated strategy, including two low-carbon transition scenarios (<2°C) by 2030. This has made it possible to target the risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy (e.g. carbon markets, withdrawal from thermal coal, reduction in landfill, heat production, electrification, reduction in certain activities). The Group is particularly exposed to the Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) introduced by the European Union in 2005, due to the quantity of free allowances granted and the cost of carbon on this market. Veolia therefore adopted an active strategy to manage its GHG emissions and allowances, by implementing an appropriate structure and creating a special-purpose legal entity to purchase, sell and price different types of greenhouse gas allowances. In 2025, the Group plans to deepen its identification and analysis of transition risks, taking into account the most appropriate scenarios, in particular the IEA NZE 2050 scenario (1).

"4.1.2.1.6 Governance of the climate commitment Governance (mitigation and adaptation) The policy for combating climate change is coordinated at the highest Group level (see section 4.1.1.4.1 above). The Board of Directors approves the Group’s strategy and makes decisions that commit the Group, such as the transition plan. It monitors the Company’s performance through the “Combating climate change” multifaceted performance indicators. Thus the emissions reduction plan targeting Net Zero with the intermediate milestone of -50% for scopes 1&2 emissions and -30% for 67% of scope 3 by 2032 was validated by the Board of Directors in December 2023. The order of deployment of the levers and the associated CapEx are validated by the Executive Management and monitored by the Finance Department. The results of climate commitments to reduce Group GHG emissions are presented annually to its Research, Innovation and Sustainable Development Committee. It is also regularly informed of Veolia’s climate change adaptation initiatives. Regarding the management of the associated climate risks, the Group’s risk map in which they are incorporated is reviewed annually by the Accounts and Audit Committee. At the Executive Committee level, two sponsors are appointed: ■Emmanuelle Menning, Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Finance and Purchasing, sponsor of the Climate Change Mitigation commitment; ■Sébastien Daziano, Director of Strategy, Innovation and Development, sponsor of the Climate Change Adaptation approach. The Finance Department is responsible for coordinating actions linked to Group commitments to climate change mitigation. The corresponding environmental performance metrics are included in the Group’s Environmental and Industrial Management System. The Climate Change Adaptation team in the Multifaceted Performance and Sustainable Development Department coordinates, with the Risk and Insurance Department, work related to climate change adaptation and climate risk management. Progress is presented and validated by the avoidance committee, in charge of monitoring such risks and the related action plans. It comprises two Executive Committee members, the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Finance and Procurement and the General Counsel as well as the Chief Risk and Insurance Officer, the Director of the Business Support & Performance department and the manager of Health and Safety Prevention for the Group. At an operational level, each Business Unit Director is responsible for breaking down the Group strategy into business opportunities and risks inherent to their business lines and region. Climate risk is identified as one of the Group’s main risks and in the Non-Financial Performance Statement. Integration of climate change performance into incentive mechanisms, as indicated in section 4.1.1.4.3 above The pay of the Group’s executives, including that of the Chief Executive Officer, is partly indexed to climate performance: ■the pay of the Chief Executive Officer, as well as that of other senior executives – in particular geographic zone executives – is indexed to climate performance. For the 2024 financial year, the variable portion related to climate performance represented 9.5% of the Chief Executive Officer’s total remuneration. ■performance shares for the Group’s executives and key contributors are also awarded based on climate performance; ■the criteria used to determine “climate performance” are: the reduction of emissions from Veolia scopes 1 and 2; the achievement of erased emissions1 targets; the progress rate of investments planned to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is therefore directly impacted by the speed of implementation of the 2030 coal exit plan. 4.1.2.1.7 Metrics Energy consumption Information on the details of the energy mix consumed and its breakdown between renewable and non-renewable energy is unavailable for this fiscal year as of the date of publication of this document.

It takes various forms, such as air, water, or soil pollution. Beyond the conventional pollutants, the development of human activities and the increasing vigilance with regard to pollution have raised awareness of the existence of new pollutants, which have only started to be analyzed and measured recently, such as microplastics, endocrine disruptors or PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). The topic of pollution is therefore diverse and concerns a high number of substances, the list of which continues to grow as studies are conducted. Hazardous waste occupies a special place among the potential sources of pollution, and the Veolia group is particularly involved in its treatment. This type of waste is subject to numerous regulations, in an increasingly strict framework to regulate its handling and treatment: ■in all areas of the world where Veolia operates, a local regulatory framework defines the qualification of hazardous waste as well as the methods of traceability, transportation, treatment and disposal; ■these national regulations are supplemented in particular by the international conventions of Basel (1989), Rotterdam (1998), Stockholm (2001), Minamata (2013), and Montreal (1987); SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 204 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
"■at European level, there are numerous texts governing hazardous waste: Commission Decision of May 3, 2000 establishing a list of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, Directive 2008/98/EU on hazardous waste treatment, Regulation n°2024/1157/EC for shipment, directives on electrical and electronic waste 2012/19/EU and batteries and accumulators 2006/66/EC, Directive 2012/18/EU, known as ""Seveso"", for the control of major-incident hazards, etc. More than 90% of the hazardous waste generated worldwide comes from industrial activities and Veolia contributes to treating a significant part of this volume, in particular: ■chemical industries including pharmaceutical and agrochemical: acidic or basic cleaning products, halogenated solvents, contaminated sludge, contaminated packaging, etc.; ■mechanical manufacturing, automotive industry, metal industry: waste contaminated with heavy metals, solvents, paint residues, etc.; ■oil industry: tank sludge, used catalysts, etc. In this context, Veolia has a dual role: 1. as an operator of industrial installations, Veolia is itself likely to generate pollution of air (e.g. energy production plants, incinerators, etc.), water and soil (e.g. discharge of industrial effluents, etc.); 2. at the same time, a significant part of Veolia’s activities is to reduce the impact of pollution emitted by third parties, for example: ▪Wastewater treatment, which avoids discharging pollutants released into soil, groundwater, or rivers. Veolia contributes to this activity both as a treatment plant operator and as a designer and marketer of treatment solutions, ▪or hazardous waste treatment, mainly through its role in the collection of such waste as well as its treatment in specialized installations. Point 1, above, is a central element of the ESRS E2 standard on the subject of pollution. It is addressed by IRO E2-ST-1 which is detailed in section 4.1.2.2.2 below. Point 2, above, is not one of the predetermined subjects in ESRS E2. Its particularly material nature at Veolia makes it an entity-specific subject of additional disclosure. Two IROs illustrate this point: E2-ES-2 and E2- ES-3. They are detailed in sections 4.1.2.2.3.2 and 4.1.2.2.3.3 below, respectively. Note that point 1 covers all Veolia’s operating activities, including those that contribute to depollution, such as the wastewater treatment plants or hazardous waste treatment installations mentioned above. Such installations are therefore analyzed from two complementary points of view. Other pollution-related topics are covered elsewhere in the sustainability statement: ■Emissions of pollutants in the form of GHG (carbon dioxide CO2, methane CH4, nitrous oxide N2O) are dealt with in § 4.1.2.1 Climate change, above; ■IRO E4-ES-1 and E4-ST-2 concern the interactions of pollution and depollution with biodiversity and ecosystems and are therefore detailed in section 4.1.2.4 below; ■IRO E5-ST-3 addresses the place of hazardous waste treatment in the circular economy and thus contributes to reducing the volume of pollution. It is detailed in section 4.1.2.5 below. 4.1.2.2.2 Pollution emitted by Veolia IRO E2-ST-1 is a negative impact, in assessing the gross risk represented by the installations operated by Veolia, and before taking into consideration the measures intended to ensure its control: Positive impact Negative impact Financial opportunity Financial risk E2-ST-1 Pollution generated by our own activities (air, water, soil, hazardous waste, etc.) Veolia’s value chain is involved at various levels: Key stakeholders involved Value chain Upstream value chain: • Regulatory authorities: Definition of the general framework of conditions to be respected; • Administrative authorities: Limits imposed on each Installation regarding the pollution emitted; • Where applicable, the third party (e.g. municipality) responsible for the installation at which Veolia is an operating service provider: definition of the type of treatment performed and performance objectives. Downstream value chain: • The planet; • Affected communities. Business Model This IRO contributes essentially to Veolia’s business model through its environmental performance. The time frame of this IRO is twofold: ■local regulations to be strictly enforced at all times: Pollution emitted by industrial installations is subject to strict local regulations by the authorities. Veolia complies with these regulations, which concern both the maximum pollution emission thresholds and the methods of control and information. For each operating permit, these subjects require daily mobilization of all operational teams to ensure operational control; ■regulations with regularly upgraded requirements: it is necessary to adapt to new and ever more stringent requirements worldwide, typically annually (regulatory changes and new customer demands). These aspects play an even more significant role since very many sites operated by the Group are regulatory classified facilities, including at ""Seveso"" level in Europe or at equivalent level outside Europe.

"The analysis shows that the main Veolia activities concerned are those detailed below: Activity Vector Possible types of pollution WATER Wastewater treatment plant Wastewater discharged after treatment into the aquatic environment and soil For pollutants the treatment of which is provided by the facility: • in normal operation: residual substances discharged after treatment and elimination of the majority of them; • exceptionally: untreated substances discharged as a result of saturation or installation failure. For pollutants present in the incoming water and for which treatment is not provided by the installation, discharge without treatment into the environment. Sludge from the treatment plant The sludge produced by sewage treatment plants varies in composition depending on the case: • sludge whose composition complies with the standards can be used for agricultural spreading; • The remaining sludge is incinerated or placed in landfill to prevent any risk of downstream pollution. Odors emitted The sludge produced is odorous and these odors are treated so as not to affect the immediate vicinity of the treatment plants. Odor treatments are installed according to the regulations, but also the proximity of the populations concerned and the sensitivity of the subject. WASTE Landfill sites for hazardous and non-hazardous waste Liquid discharges The infiltration of rainwater into the waste stored in landfills generates, after maceration, polluting liquids called leachates, which are retained and treated to avoid infiltration into the soil and groundwater. The retention systems are: • geomembranes to contain these liquids; • leachate treatment installations. Odors emitted Odors can affect the immediate vicinity of landfill sites. These odors are progressively contained by the cells covers, as the landfill site is filled. WASTE Waste incineration ENERGY Fossil fuel-based production plants Gaseous discharge from combustion gases Combustion gases contain SOx, NOx, dust, mercury, etc. and are treated before their discharge into the atmosphere to remove hazardous substances in accordance with regulatory thresholds. Solid residues after combustion (incineration ash and bottom ash) Solid residues after combustion are either recovered as part of the circular economy (e.g. metals) or placed in landfill to avoid any risk of downstream pollution. WASTE Physicochemical treatment of hazardous waste Solid and liquid residues from treatment processes Part of the product of physico-chemical treatments is recovered as part of the circular economy (recycling of oils, for example). The remaining solid and liquid fractions are incinerated or placed in landfill to prevent any risk of downstream pollution. The following two points relate to the subject of microplastics as well as to the subject of substances of concern and very high concern. Microplastics: they are present at the stages of the water cycle, from groundwater to discharge into rivers. Their quantity depends entirely on the inputs to Veolia’s installations, the ongoing measurement of their quantity is not realistic and their quantification method is not yet standardized. Certain technologies offered by Veolia to its customers make it possible to reduce their concentration (see “Depollution activities” below). Substances of concern and very high concern In the field of chemical risk, the Group conducted an analysis on the issue of substances of concern and very high concern, through a prevention group dedicated to this subject, involving the main concerned departments (scientific and technical studies, business support, health and safety risks, procurement). After examining whether Veolia is affected by such substances, it appears to date that: ■with one exception detailed below, Veolia is not concerned with the production or marketing of these substances, and to our knowledge Veolia does not use them as input substances in technical processes; ■These substances may be involved in Veolia’s operations in the form of input materials in the context of waste treatment activities, with the objective of eliminating them. Regular investigations conducted by the chemical risk prevention group have identified the use of a substance of potential concern at one site. In order to preserve manufacturing secrets, Veolia wishes to keep precise information confidential. As a precaution, Veolia is taking steps to replace this substance as soon as possible. Lastly, the process is designed not to discharge this substance and its residues into the site’s environment. A Group operational policy supporting the Business Units Veolia regularly assesses the pollution risks associated with its activities and applies a strict policy to ensure its prevention. As explained in section 4.1.1.5.1 above, Veolia makes available to its local teams all the experience gathered in the Group’s many operations to ensure the control of discharges from the installations operated, through its global network of experts, business communities and its Business Support and Performance Department. It also makes the European BAT (best available techniques) available to all BUs. This operational policy is translated locally into appropriate action plans Given the decentralized organization of Veolia’s operations, the local regulatory specificities and the terms and conditions specific to each contract, the action plans for pollution emitted by the installations can only be managed locally: ■verification by the Business Unit that the installation’s technical capabilities comply with the local standards and regulations to be applied; SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability statement 206 VEOLIA ENVIRONNEMENT / UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024"
