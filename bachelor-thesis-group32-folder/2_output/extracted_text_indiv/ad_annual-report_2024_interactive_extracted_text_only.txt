Committed, but not yet approved by the SBTi, the target is based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 2. Ahold Delhaize has also committed to set long-term scope 3 emissions reduction and net-zero targets by 2050. These targets are submitted, but not yet validated by the SBTi. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 3. In the setting of our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are planning to also make use of removals to the extent permitted by the SBTi guidance. In 2023, in line with the SBTi guidance on land-related (forest, land and agriculture sector or FLAG) and non-land-related (Energy and Industrial sector or E&I), we replaced both our near-term and long-term scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets with two reduction targets, FLAG and E&I sector targets. Both our near-term (2030) and our long-term (2050) scope 3 reduction targets are consistent with the SBTi methodology with the aim of maintaining the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase within 1.5°C of pre- industrial temperatures. The estimated FLAG emissions make up 42% our total GHG footprint in 2024. In setting the target, we applied the SBTi FLAG Standard with a linear annual reduction of 3.03%. For the E&I sector emissions target, we consider the SBTi's 4.2% annual reduction. We submitted the scope 3 targets to the SBTi in October 2023 and they are pending validation. Conversations and responses to queries from the SBTi on our submitted scope 3 targets are ongoing. We continue to use 2020 as our baseline year for scope 3, consistent with the prior submissions, given the improved quality and robustness of our local brands’ data for that year. The near-term (2030) reduction targets cover 67% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories, while the long-term (2050) reduction targets cover 90% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more details on the calculation. For setting our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are making use of removals to the extent permitted by the applicable SBTi guidance. As a general rule, the use of carbon credits must not be counted as emissions reduction toward the progress of a company’s near-term science-based targets. Carbon credits may only be considered an option for neutralizing residual emissions or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond the science-based emissions reduction targets. We follow this principle in our target setting. See GHG removals and carbon credits for more details on our approach to carbon credits. Avoided emissions fall under a separate accounting system from corporate inventories and do not count toward science-based targets. Metrics We are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol, which defines a global standardized framework for the measurement and management of GHG emissions from the private and public sectors. Our carbon footprint methodology follows the guidelines of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/WRI and we report our GHG emissions data with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our methodology, estimates and judgments around the metrics used are included in Sustainability notes.

Compared to the 2018 restated baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e Compared to our 2018 baseline, GHG emissions decreased by 36% in 2024. The main driver for the higher reduction percentage compared to last year was our reduction in emissions coming from refrigerants, demonstrating that our investments in cleaner refrigerants are paying off. GHG emissions from refrigerant leakages remained our largest source of emissions. In 2024, these emissions totaled 1,199 kilotonnes, compared to 1,323 kilotonnes in 2023. In 2024, we saw a slight decrease in our leak rate. Furthermore, because we replaced high-GWP refrigerants with low-GWP and natural refrigerants, the average GWP of these leakages decreased. Refrigerant emissions per square meter of sales area were 144 kilograms CO2e compared to 153 kilograms CO2e last year.

"climate Climate and nature can be seen as two sides of the same coin. Climate change is a key driver of nature loss, while the degradation of nature contributes to climate change and undermines nature’s ability to regulate emissions and adapt to weather events. Our climate pillar includes the material sustainability matter climate change, which covers both our impact on climate change (mainly due to GHG emissions), including the impact on nature, and the impact of climate change on our organization (mainly physical and transition risks). In the Nature section of this report, we will focus on drivers of nature loss other than climate change. climate change Definition: Understanding and mitigating business impacts on climate change by reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions across the value chain. This includes our approach to mitigating and adapting to climate-related risks and the implications for our business, including physical and transition risks, as well as the identification of climate- related opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The climate change material matter includes two sub-topics: climate change mitigation and energy and climate adaptation. Governance See General information: Governance in the sustainability statements for more information on the governance of sustainability. Our approach to climate change is rolled out globally, with our brand leadership teams responsible for implementing actions within the brands. Every brand has dedicated teams working to reduce its climate impact from own operations and the value chain. These teams consist of associates from departments such as Store Development and Store Maintenance, as well as sourcing managers. Because decarbonizing our business is such a high priority, we linked the achievement of our scope 1 and 2 GHG-emissions reduction targets to remuneration under our long-term, share-based incentive plan. In 2024, we further strengthened the connection between executive compensation and sustainability by updating our annual cash incentive plan to include, in the performance measures, having a detailed and approved scope 3 plan. We continue to keep our sustainability targets, ambitions and objectives, and their interrelation, including our GHG-emissions reduction targets, under review to ensure alignment with our overall strategy.

"Strategy As food retailers, we are aware of how climate change is impacting the way food is grown and will change our business, both now and in the years to come – from how and where products are sourced to what our brands’ stores look like and how we heat or cool them. A healthy planet is a key component of our Healthy communities & planet strategic priority, and our approach to addressing climate change in our Company focuses on both the impact of climate change on our business and how our business activities impact the climate. We aim to reduce our impact on the climate through our commitment to reach net-zero GHG emissions across our own operations by 2040 (scope 1 and 2) and become a net-zero business across the entire value chain, products and services no later than 2050 (scope 3). For more information on our strategy and how it is linked to the material sustainability matters we have identified, see Our material sustainability matters section. Transition plan Our impact and overall approach Climate change and the degradation of nature are global threats to the health of the planet and people’s lives and livelihoods. A range of issues – such as energy production, deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and waste – contribute to the climate crisis and to the health and resilience of the planet, which underpins the well-being of everyone who inhabits it. Through our activities, we are producing direct and indirect GHG emissions. This means we are impacting climate change in different ways. Examples range from the fossil fuels burned for heating and during transportation, the electricity consumed throughout our facilities or the refrigerants we use for cooling the products in our stores, to the way the products we source are produced, their usage by our brands’ customers or how the waste is treated. Of our total carbon footprint, refrigerants, electricity, heating and transport form our scope 1 and 2 footprint. The remaining emissions categories form our scope 3 footprint, representing around 96% of our total direct and indirect carbon footprint in 2024. See also Sustainability notes for a further breakdown of our GHG emissions. To support our aim of becoming a net-zero business, we have set science-based emissions reduction targets for our own operations (scope 1 and 2) as well as our entire value chain (scope 3) (pending SBTi validation) with the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in line with the Paris agreement. We leveraged a 1.5 degree-aligned pathway to determine the levers and contributions for each scope and did not consider any other scenarios in the development. Our transition plan is embedded in and aligned with our overall business strategy, as one of our strategic priorities is healthy communities & planet. To achieve a healthy planet, we are committed to lowering our GHG emissions, both in our brands’ own operations and throughout our value chain.

This ensures that our financial resources are allocated effectively to support our sustainability goals, reinforcing our commitment to a healthy planet. There are locked-in emissions associated with the capital goods we procure, for example, refrigerant systems. These emissions are factored into our scope 1 and 2 transition plans. In addition, we have scope 3 locked-in emissions that are calculated in category 11 – use of sold products, which relate to electrical goods. We recognize the lifetime emissions of the electrical goods that we sell in our GHG inventory. We aim to reduce the emissions intensity of the goods we sell, and electrical goods are a component of this strategy. The majority of emissions in category 11 for electrical products occur within the Netherlands, in which the planned decarbonization of the grid is aligned to the achievement of our scope 3 reduction targets. ESRS E1 requires companies to disclose whether they are excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks, in accordance with the exclusion criteria stated in the Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation1. This regulation requires administrators of EU Paris-aligned benchmarks to exclude from those benchmarks the companies that derive revenues over specified thresholds from certain activities (e.g., coal-, oil- or natural gas-related activities, or high-GHG-intensity electricity generation) and the companies found or estimated to significantly harm one or more of the EU Taxonomy environmental objectives. Ahold Delhaize does not meet any of the exclusion criteria and, therefore, is not excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. 1.

"Own operations (scope 1 and 2) Our first goal is to reduce emissions from our local brands’ operations. This is a relatively smaller part of the emissions in our total value chain, but these are the emissions over which we have direct control and can have the biggest direct impact. In 2024, we focused on estimating potential emissions reduction in our own operations from each lever we have identified, and further worked to estimate the resources necessary to implement our mitigation actions. The primary sources of our scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions are refrigerant leakage, electricity consumption, heating and transportation, with electricity consumption and refrigeration representing approximately 80% of total scope 1 and 2 emissions. 4.0 2.5 2.0 1.2 0.4 50% 90% 12% 100% 100% 2018 2025 2030 2035 2040 l GHG planned emissions l % reduction vs. baseline p % zero-emissions electricity Key levers To address the emissions in our brands’ operations, we have identified four key levers that will contribute the most in helping us reach our medium-term target of 2.0 MtCO2e emissions reduction, or a 50% reduction against the 2018 baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e, and our long-term target of becoming net zero (90% reduction and 10% removals) by 2040, also against our 2018 baseline. Reduction % versus 2018 baseline 2025 2030 2040 > 38% 50% ≥ 90% For more details on our scope 1 and 2 targets, see How we measure our performance. The actions we take to reduce emissions from refrigerants, transportation and on-site heating directly influence our scope 1 emissions, while the transition to zero-emissions electricity and improving energy efficiency will reduce our scope 2 emissions. Electrifying our fleet and heating will also impact electricity use and, therefore, scope 2 emissions.

"zero-emissions electricity over time, the additional impact on scope 2 emissions will also reduce over time, eventually reaching zero. For Ahold Delhaize, zero-emissions electricity includes electricity from renewable sources and electricity from nuclear sources. Transition to zero-emissions energy In 2024, approximately 34% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions were caused by electricity consumption. Our total electricity consumption is forecasted to further increase due to the electrification of our transportation and heating systems, among other factors. We plan to reduce electricity emissions to zero by 2035. We plan to achieve part of this by generating our own electricity through solar panels installed in both the U.S. and Europe. In 2024, we increased the electricity generated on-site through solar panels and used on-site by 9% compared to 2023. By 2035, we plan to source nearly all electricity, other than own-generated electricity, through virtual and direct PPAs in Europe, while in the U.S., a combination of PPAs, bundled supply contracts, unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) and nuclear energy purchases will be used, depending on the electric market rules. In 2024, we used 49% zero-emissions electricity. We actively invest in renewable energy initiatives. Our solar projects include widespread photovoltaic installations. In Europe, we signed our first pan-European PPA, which is expected to start generating renewable energy in 2026. Transition to low-GWP and natural refrigerants Nearly half (46%) of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions come from our 2024 mix of refrigerant types and associated leakage. Our brands are aiming to reduce refrigerant emissions by executing local climate plans. In order to achieve our net-zero plan, we need to replace or retrofit our refrigeration systems with low-climate-impact alternatives that can use natural or low-GWP refrigerants, minimize leakage and consume less energy. We aim to transition, year by year, to natural and low-GWP refrigerants. Natural refrigerants have significantly lower climate impact than chemical refrigerants and are more energy efficient. Our U.S. businesses are planning to convert equipment for compatibility with low-GWP or natural refrigerants. By 2040, we aim to replace around 1,200 systems with low-GWP systems and fully convert approximately 2,800 systems to natural refrigerant systems. Refrigerant emissions are among the hardest to abate, because addressing them often requires replacing entire refrigeration systems. As such, they make up the largest part of the residual emissions for our U.S. businesses. For our European brands, the current plan is to only convert systems to natural refrigerants. Of the total refrigerant systems, 40% are already using CO2 refrigerants. By 2040, we intend to convert over 1,500 systems to natural refrigerants, representing more than 50% of the total refrigerant systems. Transition from fossil fuels in heating and transportation Our fossil fuel-related emissions come mainly from two sources: transport and heating. Transport by our own fleet includes distribution, to both stores and customers, and personnel cars. These activities account for 10% of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our long-term vision is to achieve 100% fossil-fuel-free transport in both Europe and the U.S. by 2040. This will require us to replace over 5,000 vehicles in the U.S. and over 4,000 in Europe with clean alternatives, such as electric or hydrogen vehicles. Technological maturity plays an important role in how fast we can transition to cleaner energy sources. In the U.S., we face challenges in electrifying our fleets and equipment, especially for long-haul vehicles and charging infrastructure. The increased demand for electricity may also result in grid congestion, because the infrastructure is not ready, which could lead to disruptions in operations. Therefore, we continue to explore other options, such as hydrogen. Likewise, we will need to evaluate the viability of electrifying our fleets in Europe on a country- by-country basis. Natural gas and propane used for heating comprise 9% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions today. Our aim is to gradually electrify our heating systems to eliminate fossil fuel use in both the U.S. and Europe by 2040. Our plans to transition stores from fossil fuels are subject to change, and there are currently no plans to transition certain stores away from district heating systems or to implement electrified heating in select northern U.S. locations, where severe winter conditions may limit its effectiveness. Increase energy efficiency Reduction of electricity consumption is the most direct way to reduce energy-related emissions. While Ahold Delhaize’s total electricity consumption is set to increase as a result of overall decarbonization measures, energy efficiency remains a key lever in reducing environmental impact. We are installing energy-efficient equipment, such as LED lights, doors on cabinets, heat recuperation, heat pumps, new refrigeration systems, improved insulation and new passive doors on freezers. Taking measures like these when remodeling is enabling our brands to create energy-efficient stores. Scope 1 and 2 road to decarbonization The farther in the future our plans are set to be executed, the less certain is the feasibility and achievability of our actions on key levers, as well as the costs of these actions. For actions scheduled to be executed from 2025 to 2028, we have built the plans from the brand level up and included the estimated CapEx necessary to execute them in our long-range plans. We have estimated the feasibility and reduction potential with a reasonable level of reliability, but the actual outcomes can still differ. For the period 2029 to 2040, our plans are more high level and include more assumptions. As a result, we have a higher level of uncertainty around whether our estimated outcomes are achievable and the reductions will materialize as estimated. Our current expectations are that, based upon the identified action plans and the progress we are making, we are on a positive trajectory to meet our targets of 50% reduction by 2030, subject to our estimates and assumptions as set out below. For the period 2030 to 2040, we will continue to make our high-level plans more concrete, taking into account available and developing technology and insights. We have made a lot of progress identifying the high-level plans and actions, and we now have a better view of what our road to net zero until 2040 looks like. However, the high level of uncertainty, due to the longer-term nature of the actions, changing regulations and reliance on technology and infrastructure that is sometimes not yet fully operational or proven in practice, still leads to significant uncertainty and causes us to be dependent on various assumptions to provide more detail (see Assumptions and estimates used in calculations below). To reach net zero in 2040, we will offset our residual emissions by sourcing carbon removal credits. Our current projection is that we will reduce 90% of scope 1 and 2 emissions and offset the remaining 10%. Based on our transition plan, we expect that our residual emissions will come from low-GWP refrigerants and fossil fuels for heating and transportation. For more details on our carbon removals, see section GHG removals and carbon credits below.

Total electricity consumption is expected to increase due to the electrification of transport and heating. ó 100% zero-emissions energy can be acquired at close to parity with grid power. ó When determining the costs of abatement and reduction initiatives, we used current costs and we included costs associated with our leased assets (i.e., we did not assume cost reduction that may take place when technology scales and matures). Investments and funding supporting the implementation of our transition plan The implementation of our transition plan to achieve net-zero emissions will require significant investments in clean, low-emissions and zero-emissions technologies. These investments are covered in our Growing Together strategy, which includes a gross cash capital expenditure cadence of 3% of net sales. We have allocated the necessary financial resources to support our transition plan over the strategic period (until 2028), as this is the time horizon for financial planning and allocation. In our investment plans, we do not differentiate between regular replacement CapEx and incremental CapEx that directly contributes to our scope 1 and 2 reduction program. As a consequence, we do not disclose the monetary amounts related to the incremental investments to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. It is also important to note that the further we project into the future, the more uncertain these costs become. Factors such as advancements in technology could potentially reduce costs, while high demand might drive them up. In addition, the plans themselves are subject to change as new information and technologies emerge. At the end of each year, we review our total CapEx spend to determine the portion that is eligible and aligned with the EU Taxonomy. While we anticipate that the CapEx spend eligible for the EU Taxonomy will increase in future years, driven by the increase in total CapEx spend for the transition plan, alignment is more difficult to predict, as not all investments will meet the EU Taxonomy alignment criteria. For instance, some investments in vehicles may not fully comply with the DNSH noise regulations, even though they help us in lowering GHG emissions.

"In 2024, we spent: ó €896 million on EU Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned CapEx ó €118 million on EU Taxonomy-eligible and aligned CapEx Of the EU Taxonomy-eligible and aligned CapEx, approximately €37 million is related to the actions mentioned in this transition plan, including refrigerants replacement, investments in fossil fuel-free transport and heating, solar panels and energy efficiency measures. See EU Taxonomy for more information. In 2024, Ahold Delhaize issued a new Green Financing Instrument in the form of a Green Bond for a total notional amount of €500 million. Part of the proceeds of the Green Bond are used to invest in the actions mentioned in this transition plan. The framework used to determine which investments can be considered green is broader than the EU Taxonomy, while being in line with the ICMA (International Capital Markets Association) guidelines and signed off by second-party opinion provider Sustainalytics. Therefore, we expect a larger portion of the total transition plan CapEx spend to align with our Green Finance Framework. Similar to the EU Taxonomy, we report the total CapEx spend that can be considered sustainable according to our Green Bond framework each year. This amount is also expected to increase over the years as we continue to invest more funds in our transition plan. In 2024, we spent approximately €300 million on Green Bond CapEx, of which around €210 million is related to the actions mentioned in this transition plan. This number is lower than the total Green Bond spend because investments in new buildings and investments such as bottle and can collectors and route optimization software, which are part of total Green Bond, are not linked to the transition plan. Each year, we will track our progress by comparing actual emissions reductions against the expected emissions reduction in the transition plan and evaluating our actual investments against the planned investments. The investments related to the transition plan consist of additions to the property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. See also EU Taxonomy note for a reconciliation of the additions included in the financial statements (Note 11, Note 12, Note 13 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) to the total CapEx under the EU Taxonomy. The operating expenses related to the transition plan measures consist mainly of costs related to electricity purchased, diesel/ gasoline for transportation and fuels used for heating and cooling. These are fully integrated into the daily operations and are recorded as part of other operating expenses; see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Value chain (scope 3) The vast majority of our GHG emissions are scope 3, which are indirect emissions that take place across our value chain – for example, emissions generated through the production and manufacturing of the products we sell and the use of those products. Our value chain consists of thousands of suppliers, producers and farmers who supply hundreds of thousands of products that are sold to millions of customers across the U.S. and Europe each day. Our scope 3 emissions are driven by purchased goods and services, use of sold products and other categories (e.g., business travel). The category “purchased goods and services” represented 80% of our total carbon footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3) or 84% of our scope 3 emissions in 2024. For more details on our scope 3 targets, see How we measure our performance. Challenges With the vast majority of our value chain emissions falling outside of our direct control, to achieve our targets, we will need to promote societal change and collaborate across the industry; we cannot achieve our scope 3 targets without working closely with our brands’ suppliers and customers. For this reason, playing a part in wider society and cooperating across our brands’ value chains are integral parts of our plan. Supplier action Our ability to drive scope 3 emissions reduction depends on the efforts of our suppliers and customers. The size and diversity of our supplier network presents challenges as we seek to influence, scale and track decarbonization practices. In some of our local brands’ operating regions, industry bodies are not pursuing climate action until 2030; this inaction will create barriers to value chain decarbonization. Our local brands are encouraging suppliers to set science-based climate targets and engaging with them on specific decarbonization measures. Customer action Addressing the behavior-action gap is complex, as it requires a multi-layered approach and there are many individual and societal factors at play that are not within our direct circle of influence. Our brands’ 150 years of experience in engaging, inviting, nudging and encouraging consumers will help them facilitate this required change in behavior. Key levers To reduce GHG emissions within our supply chain, we have identified the following key priorities: engaging with our brands’ suppliers and farmers, providing an assortment with a lower carbon footprint, and encouraging customers to choose lower-emission products. Engaging suppliers in setting science-based targets and implementing sustainable practices Our brands encourage suppliers to set emissions reduction targets in line with the latest science. These commitments will accelerate improvements in livestock farming, raw material sourcing, processing, transport, packaging, deforestation and food waste reduction and could help address the majority of our scope 3 emissions by 2030. As of January 2025, 61 of Ahold Delhaize’s top 100 suppliers have either set science- based targets or are committed to doing so (SBTi Companies Taking Action). Actions being taken by suppliers include: Livestock farming: GHG emissions from livestock can be reduced by focusing on enteric fermentation and manure management. This involves strategies such as improving animal feed formulas, using feed additives (including bovaer and red algae) to reduce methane emissions, harnessing biogas from liquid manure, and adjusting manure pH with sulfuric acid. Processing: Encouraging suppliers to optimize their production processes through energy efficiency, new machines or switching to renewable energy sources. Environmental information: climate continued Climate change continued Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2024 110"
"Food loss and waste: We seek to combat food loss and waste throughout the value chain across all product categories. This includes losses in agriculture, such as those due to machine failure; post-harvest losses, including from quality defects; losses during processing; and operational waste within our brands’ stores. We tackle food waste through various approaches, including maximizing product utilization, for example, through upcycling; refining product management, such as through enhanced demand planning; and enhancing product distribution, including through decreased transit times or optimized routes. See also Waste. Deforestation-free supply chain: By 2025, Ahold Delhaize and its brands have the ambition to be 100% deforestation and land conversion free for own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil, tea, soy and wood fiber. See also Biodiversity and ecosystems. Agricultural practices: Most of our products are agriculture based. Agriculture can have net positive or negative emissions, depending on the underlying practices used. Ahold Delhaize brands seek to engage with suppliers and farmers to reduce or sequester emissions by incentivizing sustainable change through longer-term contracts with concrete environmental requirements and through co-investments on farms. Activities under this lever include optimizing the use of fertilizers and pesticides; using regenerative agricultural methods, such as no-till farming and cover cropping; and taking measures related to agroforestry, afforestation and reforestation. Low-carbon footprint products Assortment of products: In collaboration with suppliers, our brands seek to reduce the carbon footprint of their local assortments. Our local brands remain committed to empowering customers to make environmentally conscious choices. This strategy varies across our different brands and can include promoting a health-focused and reduced-GHG-emissions product lineup, investing in product development, and transitioning from high- emission protein sources, such as red meat, to lower-emission sources, such as white meat or plant-based alternatives. In Europe, the transition to plant-based proteins is one way we are working toward offering products with a lower carbon footprint. Our European brands agreed to a regional target of at least 50% plant-based sales by 2030. At the same time, this action also reinforces our dedication to a healthier and more sustainable food system and inspires our brands’ customers to make healthier choices. See also Customers’ health and nutrition and access to healthy affordable products. Customer engagement Proactively engaging with customers (unquantified impact): Our local brands encourage customers to shift toward lower- emission products. They continue to help customers understand the impact of their buying decisions and make choices that fit their needs, their tastes and their values. They do this by stimulating and rewarding sustainable choices through loyalty programs and discounts, increasing product transparency through navigation systems and product labelling, improving assortments and products with more vegan and vegetarian choices, and increasing customers’ knowledge of healthy lifestyles by giving them access to free dietitians and knowledge platforms. Recognizing the challenges of behavior change, we focus on addressing the barriers customers have identified, facilitating easier, informed choices through accessible information, inspiration and incentives. We are committed to continuously improving our brands’ product offerings, ensuring that affordable, healthy and sustainable options remain accessible. Scope 3 road to decarbonization Category 1 – Purchased goods and services is the largest scope 3 category. Therefore, when we started working on concrete plans for reducing scope 3 emissions, we prioritized this category. We identified six levers, plus an “other” category to be quantified. Due to the high level of uncertainty around data accuracy and availability, we only report on the estimated reduction potential by 2030 and not up to our long-term and net-zero target date of 2050. Achieving our long-term revised scope 3 emissions targets and our net-zero target will require intense cooperation across the value chain. We considered two scenarios in our analysis. The theoretical reduction potential of the levers remained the same across the scenarios; however, in the lower boundary, we assumed moderate achievability, while, in the upper boundary, we assumed accelerated achievability. We analyzed these two scenarios to understand what the outcomes may be with limited engagement and what would be possible with accelerated engagement. When we assessed the potential to achieve our targets, we took into consideration an assumption on annual growth rate. We anticipate shifts in customer preferences and demand as well as impacts from regulatory factors as we transition to a lower-carbon economy. As part of our transition plan, we aim to help customers choose lower-carbon products. See IRO management for further analysis on transition risks and opportunities. Ahold Delhaize and its brands are currently working to build knowledge and create a broader level of commitment to science-based targets within our supply chain. In addition, we work in partnership with other players in our supply chain to understand the initiatives and levers that they are actioning to decarbonize, linking the GHG emission reduction quantification of the actions to monitor progress toward our collective GHG emissions reduction targets. Based on the quantification of the levers, we believe that they have a cumulative estimated reduction potential of between 8.8 (lower boundary) and 27.6 MtCO2e (upper boundary) by 2030.

"Physical risks outcomes Our 2024 scenario analysis suggests that flash floods, riverine floods and tropical windstorms pose the greatest potential threat to our own operations across future time horizons, in both the Paris Ambition and No Policy scenarios. These results are consistent with our 2023 analysis, with the exception that tropical windstorms now display a higher threat to our brands’ operations than heat waves (which we reported as a top risk in 2023). This change is due to the expansion of our analysis and the nature of the additional facilities included in our 2024 assessment. As shown in the table above, when not considering existing mitigation or adaptation efforts, the model suggests that exposure to physical climate hazards may result in a moderate impact on revenue disruption and potentially a high impact of asset damage. Furthermore, exposure is set to increase by 2040 in both scenarios (albeit within the same risk impact ranges). Although our modeling does not predict significant differences in physical risk exposure across scenarios, the potential for adverse (financial) impact is more pronounced in a No Policy scenario. This is because the Paris Ambition scenario assumes more ambitious climate policy action and mitigation efforts to curb the impacts of climate change and, therefore, reduced overall physical impacts. During 2024, we already experienced operational disruption and asset damage as a result of climate-related events across the locations where our brands operate, including hurricane impact in the U.S. and flooding across Central and Eastern Europe. It is worth noting that the modeled outcome represents a combined physical risk exposure across our many thousands of facilities. The geographical spread of our locations likely reduces the risk of any one event significantly impacting our business. Our climate risk scenario assessment is ongoing, and we will continue to enhance our analysis. As noted, we have not yet come to a final conclusion about the potential financial value at risk as a result of the residual exposure to climate hazards, taking into account existing mitigation efforts such as site- level adaptation plans or insurance coverage. The outcomes of the 2024 climate scenario analysis were considered in the “climate and nature-related” principal risk in our ERM profile. Transition risk outcomes The carbon pricing model analyzes how adjustments in carbon pricing might impact operational costs, such as the cost of power and utilities, and the prices we pay our suppliers. Currently, in the jurisdictions where we operate, Ahold Delhaize is not subject to material policy requirements on carbon pricing, as the focus for GHG emission trading systems and certificates has been centered on energy- intensive sectors. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes a roll-back of any and all existing carbon pricing systems. The Paris Ambition scenario models a far- reaching adoption of increasing rates of carbon taxation, which could present a significant financial burden for our business if mitigating actions are not taken. Whatever the scenario, as we recognize the need to incentivize decision-making to align with our climate-related targets, we apply internal carbon pricing to relevant CapEx investment decisions. See Internal carbon pricing for more details. The significant differences identified in the potential exposure to transition risks between scenarios creates further incentives for us to mitigate transition risks by continuing to work toward achieving our emissions reduction targets to reach net zero by 2050, outlined in our Transition Plan sections above. The consumer sentiment model examines the impact of consumers’ sustainable buying habits on our sales. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes limited to no uptake in products that are perceived as more sustainable, resulting in an expected low impact on our financial position. To meet the Paris Ambition going forward, the model predicts a significant increase in the risk value as customer purchasing decisions are expected to shift drastically toward lower- carbon impact products. This shift could create a moderate unmitigated risk for our business within the next five years, moving to a high risk by 2040. See Managing climate- related risks and opportunities for details on our risk response. In the current context, although our brands’ customers are becoming increasingly climate-aware, elements such as affordability and quality remain as the key drivers for purchasing decisions. Opportunities In our view, the impacts of climate change also offer opportunities. For example, by reducing our emissions and increasing our climate resilience, we believe we can increase operational cost efficiency and attract talented people who wish to work for a company that is actively addressing the impacts within its control and contributing to climate change mitigation.

"Transition risks: Regulatory risks ó We aim to reduce our carbon footprint by identifying and implementing ways of making equipment in use and buildings more energy efficient – see Own operations (scope 1 and 2). ó We are mitigating regulatory risks through our work on sustainable packaging, food waste, sustainable sourcing, reformulation of own- brand products, product transparency and the expansion of our brands’ ranges to include more low-carbon products. Transition risks: Market risks ó Our brands are developing and diversifying their product offerings to provide customers with more plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, to ensure that our business model and product assortments remain competitive and compatible with changing customer demands. ó Our net-zero ambitions identify the use of renewable energy as a way to reduce our carbon footprint. While our brands continue to make use of opportunities to install more solar panels, they also actively pursue the acquisition of other sources of renewable energy, such as (virtual) PPAs for green energy. Next steps Based on the 2024 physical hazard assessment results, we are evaluating the adaptation solutions that have been implemented or may be available at facilities with elevated climate hazard exposure. To further understand the residual climate risk that these facilities may face, we will continue to consult with local teams to evaluate existing protection measures and resilience strategies, such as design standards, business continuity plans, local climate action plans and climate considerations in CapEx investment proposals. In addition, we plan to assess climate risks across our value chain in due course. The transition insights we have gained provide further support for our transition plan and help us focus our efforts on achieving strategic, climate-related opportunities, for example, by informing more sustainable product decisions. Policies We have an overarching sustainability policy that covers our approach on climate and specific climate-related standards that provide further guidance to our brands. See also General information: Governance. Within our climate approach, we are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol. See Climate change in the Sustainability notes for more details on our methodology. Our standard on renewable energy introduces the approach of Ahold Delhaize and its local brands to sourcing renewable energy and implementing energy efficiency measures, which are linked to the key levers identified in our transition plan. It concerns the sourcing of renewable energy to achieve net-zero emissions in the Company’s market-based scope 2 footprint. It is applicable to our global operations and excludes renewable energy consumed outside our own operations, i.e., in the value chain, and energy carriers such as fuels. By adhering to these guidelines, we strive to achieve zero-emissions electricity by 2035. Our standard on carbon offsets includes our approach on the use of offsets to achieve our net-zero goals. It covers the neutralization of residual emissions in Ahold Delhaize’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) through carbon removal projects outside of the Company’s own operations and value chain. The standard establishes a framework for purchasing high- integrity offsets that contribute to our net-zero targets, while remaining aligned with Ahold Delhaize’s overall sustainability values. See also GHG removals and carbon credits. Actions and resources Our actions to reduce our negative impacts and mitigate risks are centered on the following topics: GHG emissions and CCM See Transition plan for an explanation of the key levers, the actions undertaken by the brands and the resources allocated. Management of climate-related risks See Climate-related risks for work done to assess climate-related risks, outcomes and next steps. How we measure our performance In order to ensure that measures are taken to reduce GHG emissions in our own operations and supply chain and to increase energy efficiency in our own operations, we have set the targets mentioned below. In setting up our targets, we engaged with brands stakeholders as well as with senior leadership teams and the Executive Committee. As the SBTi is the only internationally recognized GHG-target setting body, our targets are aligned to their pathways and are pending validation, except for the scope 1 and 2 near-term target, which has been approved. We currently have no additional targets set on climate-related risks and opportunities, CCA or transition risk mitigation. As we advance our work on climate, we will evaluate the need to define and update our targets. Scope 1 and 2 targets Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) (2018 baseline1) Short term >38% reduction by 2025 Near term 50% reduction by 20302 Long term Net zero: 90% reduction and 10% removals by 2040 Milestone Near term We plan to reduce electricity emissions to zero by 2035. Timeline Target 1. The 2018 restated baseline is 4.0 MtCO2e. 2. The SBTi has approved Ahold Delhaize’s scope 1 and 2 near-term science-based emissions reduction targets. These targets are based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. Ahold Delhaize developed science-based targets (SBTs) for scopes 1 and 2 (market- based) in 2019, and submitted targets to the SBTi for validation in 2020. Our near-term emissions reduction targets for scope 1 and 2, set in 2019, have been formally approved by the SBTi. This means that the SBTi has assessed the targets against the emissions reduction pathways necessary for the world to limit global average temperature rise 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels and found them to be consistent with that outcome. In accordance with SBTi technical guidance on setting SBTs, 2018 was selected as the baseline year, since it was the most recent year with robust scope 1 and 2 footprint data. The 2018 (restated) baseline for SBTi target setting is 4.0 MtCO2e; see Sustainability notes for further details.

"Scope 3 targets Scope 3 (2020 SBTi-methodology baseline) Short term ó Suppliers representing 70% of our footprint will be asked to commit to the SBTi by 2025. ó All our suppliers will be asked to report on scope 3 by 2025. Near term1 ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 30.3% by 2030 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for near-term target (of 16.8 MtCO2e)1. ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 E&I GHG emissions by 42.0% by 2030 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for near-term target (of 23.7 MtCO2e)1.

Net zero ó We commit to reach net-zero GHG emissions across our value chain by 20503. Timeline Target 1. Committed, but not yet approved by the SBTi, the target is based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 2. Ahold Delhaize has also committed to set long-term scope 3 emissions reduction and net-zero targets by 2050. These targets are submitted, but not yet validated by the SBTi. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 3. In the setting of our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are planning to also make use of removals to the extent permitted by the SBTi guidance. In 2023, in line with the SBTi guidance on land-related (forest, land and agriculture sector or FLAG) and non-land-related (Energy and Industrial sector or E&I), we replaced both our near-term and long-term scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets with two reduction targets, FLAG and E&I sector targets. Both our near-term (2030) and our long-term (2050) scope 3 reduction targets are consistent with the SBTi methodology with the aim of maintaining the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase within 1.5°C of pre- industrial temperatures. The estimated FLAG emissions make up 42% our total GHG footprint in 2024. In setting the target, we applied the SBTi FLAG Standard with a linear annual reduction of 3.03%. For the E&I sector emissions target, we consider the SBTi's 4.2% annual reduction. We submitted the scope 3 targets to the SBTi in October 2023 and they are pending validation. Conversations and responses to queries from the SBTi on our submitted scope 3 targets are ongoing. We continue to use 2020 as our baseline year for scope 3, consistent with the prior submissions, given the improved quality and robustness of our local brands’ data for that year. The near-term (2030) reduction targets cover 67% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories, while the long-term (2050) reduction targets cover 90% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more details on the calculation. For setting our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are making use of removals to the extent permitted by the applicable SBTi guidance. As a general rule, the use of carbon credits must not be counted as emissions reduction toward the progress of a company’s near-term science-based targets. Carbon credits may only be considered an option for neutralizing residual emissions or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond the science-based emissions reduction targets. We follow this principle in our target setting. See GHG removals and carbon credits for more details on our approach to carbon credits. Avoided emissions fall under a separate accounting system from corporate inventories and do not count toward science-based targets. Metrics We are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol, which defines a global standardized framework for the measurement and management of GHG emissions from the private and public sectors. Our carbon footprint methodology follows the guidelines of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/WRI and we report our GHG emissions data with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our methodology, estimates and judgments around the metrics used are included in Sustainability notes.

Performance management GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) 2024 2023 restated Change vs. prior year Target 2030 Absolute CO2e emissions from own operations (MtCO2e) 2.58 2.65 (0.07) % reduction in absolute CO2e emissions from own operations against 2018 baseline1 36% 34% 2pp 50% 1. Compared to the 2018 restated baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e Compared to our 2018 baseline, GHG emissions decreased by 36% in 2024. The main driver for the higher reduction percentage compared to last year was our reduction in emissions coming from refrigerants, demonstrating that our investments in cleaner refrigerants are paying off. GHG emissions from refrigerant leakages remained our largest source of emissions. In 2024, these emissions totaled 1,199 kilotonnes, compared to 1,323 kilotonnes in 2023. In 2024, we saw a slight decrease in our leak rate. Furthermore, because we replaced high-GWP refrigerants with low-GWP and natural refrigerants, the average GWP of these leakages decreased. Refrigerant emissions per square meter of sales area were 144 kilograms CO2e compared to 153 kilograms CO2e last year.

"Physical risks outcomes Our 2024 scenario analysis suggests that flash floods, riverine floods and tropical windstorms pose the greatest potential threat to our own operations across future time horizons, in both the Paris Ambition and No Policy scenarios. These results are consistent with our 2023 analysis, with the exception that tropical windstorms now display a higher threat to our brands’ operations than heat waves (which we reported as a top risk in 2023). This change is due to the expansion of our analysis and the nature of the additional facilities included in our 2024 assessment. As shown in the table above, when not considering existing mitigation or adaptation efforts, the model suggests that exposure to physical climate hazards may result in a moderate impact on revenue disruption and potentially a high impact of asset damage. Furthermore, exposure is set to increase by 2040 in both scenarios (albeit within the same risk impact ranges). Although our modeling does not predict significant differences in physical risk exposure across scenarios, the potential for adverse (financial) impact is more pronounced in a No Policy scenario. This is because the Paris Ambition scenario assumes more ambitious climate policy action and mitigation efforts to curb the impacts of climate change and, therefore, reduced overall physical impacts. During 2024, we already experienced operational disruption and asset damage as a result of climate-related events across the locations where our brands operate, including hurricane impact in the U.S. and flooding across Central and Eastern Europe. It is worth noting that the modeled outcome represents a combined physical risk exposure across our many thousands of facilities. The geographical spread of our locations likely reduces the risk of any one event significantly impacting our business. Our climate risk scenario assessment is ongoing, and we will continue to enhance our analysis. As noted, we have not yet come to a final conclusion about the potential financial value at risk as a result of the residual exposure to climate hazards, taking into account existing mitigation efforts such as site- level adaptation plans or insurance coverage. The outcomes of the 2024 climate scenario analysis were considered in the “climate and nature-related” principal risk in our ERM profile. Transition risk outcomes The carbon pricing model analyzes how adjustments in carbon pricing might impact operational costs, such as the cost of power and utilities, and the prices we pay our suppliers. Currently, in the jurisdictions where we operate, Ahold Delhaize is not subject to material policy requirements on carbon pricing, as the focus for GHG emission trading systems and certificates has been centered on energy- intensive sectors. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes a roll-back of any and all existing carbon pricing systems. The Paris Ambition scenario models a far- reaching adoption of increasing rates of carbon taxation, which could present a significant financial burden for our business if mitigating actions are not taken. Whatever the scenario, as we recognize the need to incentivize decision-making to align with our climate-related targets, we apply internal carbon pricing to relevant CapEx investment decisions. See Internal carbon pricing for more details. The significant differences identified in the potential exposure to transition risks between scenarios creates further incentives for us to mitigate transition risks by continuing to work toward achieving our emissions reduction targets to reach net zero by 2050, outlined in our Transition Plan sections above. The consumer sentiment model examines the impact of consumers’ sustainable buying habits on our sales. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes limited to no uptake in products that are perceived as more sustainable, resulting in an expected low impact on our financial position. To meet the Paris Ambition going forward, the model predicts a significant increase in the risk value as customer purchasing decisions are expected to shift drastically toward lower- carbon impact products. This shift could create a moderate unmitigated risk for our business within the next five years, moving to a high risk by 2040. See Managing climate- related risks and opportunities for details on our risk response. In the current context, although our brands’ customers are becoming increasingly climate-aware, elements such as affordability and quality remain as the key drivers for purchasing decisions. Opportunities In our view, the impacts of climate change also offer opportunities. For example, by reducing our emissions and increasing our climate resilience, we believe we can increase operational cost efficiency and attract talented people who wish to work for a company that is actively addressing the impacts within its control and contributing to climate change mitigation. Managing climate-related risks and opportunities The modeling scenarios prepared in the climate risk assessment tool (and in the past) are useful for understanding the potential (financial) impacts of climate change on our business. Beyond that, it is valuable to look more broadly at the results and consider them in the context of our wider organizational risk management processes for further analysis. Our actions and progress to address the impact of climate-related risks on our business (in addition to the scenario analysis work described above) are further explained below. Physical risks ó We limit financial losses by procuring property damage and business interruption (PDBI) insurance against damage from natural catastrophes and weather-related events. ó Our Global Asset Protection function runs an extensive risk engineering program across all our brands to understand, quantify and mitigate a variety of hazards, including natural catastrophes. Risk engineering specialists visit our distribution network and HSCs on an annual rotation to perform risk assessments and provide actionable improvement recommendations. The results of those assessments assist site management and Global Asset Protection in implementing risk mitigation measures proactively and effectively, ensuring better resilience against physical risks. ó On a forward-looking basis, we leverage the expertise of the risk engineers for new building designs and construction projects to implement risk mitigation elements during the planning phase. ó Our brands implement various adaptation measures to protect the business from climate change impacts, for example, enhancing drainage and installing rainwater collection system to adapt to flood or drought risk. ó Our food retail brands are engaging with suppliers to implement sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate risks around product procurement and decreasing agricultural yields.

"Transition risks: Regulatory risks ó We aim to reduce our carbon footprint by identifying and implementing ways of making equipment in use and buildings more energy efficient – see Own operations (scope 1 and 2). ó We are mitigating regulatory risks through our work on sustainable packaging, food waste, sustainable sourcing, reformulation of own- brand products, product transparency and the expansion of our brands’ ranges to include more low-carbon products. Transition risks: Market risks ó Our brands are developing and diversifying their product offerings to provide customers with more plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, to ensure that our business model and product assortments remain competitive and compatible with changing customer demands. ó Our net-zero ambitions identify the use of renewable energy as a way to reduce our carbon footprint. While our brands continue to make use of opportunities to install more solar panels, they also actively pursue the acquisition of other sources of renewable energy, such as (virtual) PPAs for green energy. Next steps Based on the 2024 physical hazard assessment results, we are evaluating the adaptation solutions that have been implemented or may be available at facilities with elevated climate hazard exposure. To further understand the residual climate risk that these facilities may face, we will continue to consult with local teams to evaluate existing protection measures and resilience strategies, such as design standards, business continuity plans, local climate action plans and climate considerations in CapEx investment proposals. In addition, we plan to assess climate risks across our value chain in due course. The transition insights we have gained provide further support for our transition plan and help us focus our efforts on achieving strategic, climate-related opportunities, for example, by informing more sustainable product decisions. Policies We have an overarching sustainability policy that covers our approach on climate and specific climate-related standards that provide further guidance to our brands. See also General information: Governance. Within our climate approach, we are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol. See Climate change in the Sustainability notes for more details on our methodology. Our standard on renewable energy introduces the approach of Ahold Delhaize and its local brands to sourcing renewable energy and implementing energy efficiency measures, which are linked to the key levers identified in our transition plan. It concerns the sourcing of renewable energy to achieve net-zero emissions in the Company’s market-based scope 2 footprint. It is applicable to our global operations and excludes renewable energy consumed outside our own operations, i.e., in the value chain, and energy carriers such as fuels. By adhering to these guidelines, we strive to achieve zero-emissions electricity by 2035. Our standard on carbon offsets includes our approach on the use of offsets to achieve our net-zero goals. It covers the neutralization of residual emissions in Ahold Delhaize’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) through carbon removal projects outside of the Company’s own operations and value chain. The standard establishes a framework for purchasing high- integrity offsets that contribute to our net-zero targets, while remaining aligned with Ahold Delhaize’s overall sustainability values. See also GHG removals and carbon credits. Actions and resources Our actions to reduce our negative impacts and mitigate risks are centered on the following topics: GHG emissions and CCM See Transition plan for an explanation of the key levers, the actions undertaken by the brands and the resources allocated. Management of climate-related risks See Climate-related risks for work done to assess climate-related risks, outcomes and next steps. How we measure our performance In order to ensure that measures are taken to reduce GHG emissions in our own operations and supply chain and to increase energy efficiency in our own operations, we have set the targets mentioned below. In setting up our targets, we engaged with brands stakeholders as well as with senior leadership teams and the Executive Committee. As the SBTi is the only internationally recognized GHG-target setting body, our targets are aligned to their pathways and are pending validation, except for the scope 1 and 2 near-term target, which has been approved. We currently have no additional targets set on climate-related risks and opportunities, CCA or transition risk mitigation. As we advance our work on climate, we will evaluate the need to define and update our targets. Scope 1 and 2 targets Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) (2018 baseline1) Short term >38% reduction by 2025 Near term 50% reduction by 20302 Long term Net zero: 90% reduction and 10% removals by 2040 Milestone Near term We plan to reduce electricity emissions to zero by 2035. Timeline Target 1. The 2018 restated baseline is 4.0 MtCO2e. 2. The SBTi has approved Ahold Delhaize’s scope 1 and 2 near-term science-based emissions reduction targets. These targets are based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. Ahold Delhaize developed science-based targets (SBTs) for scopes 1 and 2 (market- based) in 2019, and submitted targets to the SBTi for validation in 2020. Our near-term emissions reduction targets for scope 1 and 2, set in 2019, have been formally approved by the SBTi. This means that the SBTi has assessed the targets against the emissions reduction pathways necessary for the world to limit global average temperature rise 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels and found them to be consistent with that outcome. In accordance with SBTi technical guidance on setting SBTs, 2018 was selected as the baseline year, since it was the most recent year with robust scope 1 and 2 footprint data. The 2018 (restated) baseline for SBTi target setting is 4.0 MtCO2e; see Sustainability notes for further details.

"Scope 3 targets Scope 3 (2020 SBTi-methodology baseline) Short term ó Suppliers representing 70% of our footprint will be asked to commit to the SBTi by 2025. ó All our suppliers will be asked to report on scope 3 by 2025. Near term1 ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 30.3% by 2030 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for near-term target (of 16.8 MtCO2e)1. ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 E&I GHG emissions by 42.0% by 2030 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for near-term target (of 23.7 MtCO2e)1.

Net zero ó We commit to reach net-zero GHG emissions across our value chain by 20503. Timeline Target 1. Committed, but not yet approved by the SBTi, the target is based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 2. Ahold Delhaize has also committed to set long-term scope 3 emissions reduction and net-zero targets by 2050. These targets are submitted, but not yet validated by the SBTi. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 3. In the setting of our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are planning to also make use of removals to the extent permitted by the SBTi guidance. In 2023, in line with the SBTi guidance on land-related (forest, land and agriculture sector or FLAG) and non-land-related (Energy and Industrial sector or E&I), we replaced both our near-term and long-term scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets with two reduction targets, FLAG and E&I sector targets. Both our near-term (2030) and our long-term (2050) scope 3 reduction targets are consistent with the SBTi methodology with the aim of maintaining the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase within 1.5°C of pre- industrial temperatures. The estimated FLAG emissions make up 42% our total GHG footprint in 2024. In setting the target, we applied the SBTi FLAG Standard with a linear annual reduction of 3.03%. For the E&I sector emissions target, we consider the SBTi's 4.2% annual reduction. We submitted the scope 3 targets to the SBTi in October 2023 and they are pending validation. Conversations and responses to queries from the SBTi on our submitted scope 3 targets are ongoing. We continue to use 2020 as our baseline year for scope 3, consistent with the prior submissions, given the improved quality and robustness of our local brands’ data for that year. The near-term (2030) reduction targets cover 67% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories, while the long-term (2050) reduction targets cover 90% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories.

"We will use the results of the nature project to review and determine what the next steps will be. We currently focus on our own-brand supply chain, as this is where we have the greatest oversight and control over the way products are farmed, produced and packaged. Over time, we will continue to consider how we can better understand and address these issues within our national-brand supply chains. In addition, the EU has legislation addressing deforestation: the EUDR. Ahold Delhaize and its European brands will comply with this regulation when it becomes applicable. The EUDR entered into force in June 2023 and was initially scheduled to become applicable on December 30, 2024. However, the EU Parliament and the Council have recently agreed to the Commission’s proposal to delay its application by one year to give companies and authorities more time to better prepare for its implementation. This legislation aims to minimize deforestation and forest degradation associated with certain commodities and relevant products placed on the EU market. Sustainable and regenerative agriculture Poor farming practices can have adverse impacts on soil, waterways and biodiversity. As well as resulting in environmental damage, these practices can also undermine the resilience and productivity of food supply chains, which has consequences for food security, communities and businesses alike. We identified several of the topics impacted by unsustainable farming practices as material sub-sub-topics during the DMA: land degradation, climate change (see Climate change), pollution of air, soil and water (see Pollution), water consumption and withdrawals (see Water and marine resources), and impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services. Ahold Delhaize currently does not have a policy on sustainable and regenerative agriculture and, as these are topics within the value chain, the transitional phase-in provisions will be utilized for reporting. All brands are, however, encouraged to support these types of farming practices. The nature of this support will depend on the resources and capacity of the brand and the make-up and structure of its supply chain. Actions and resources Actions to implement the existing policies around biodiversity and ecosystems did not result in significant, separately identifiable operating or capital expenditure in 2024. Ahold Delhaize brands have dedicated Health and Sustainability teams that address matters relating to biodiversity alongside other sustainability topics. In addition to the actions discussed below, many other elements of our healthy communities & planet approach also reduce our negative impacts on nature and biodiversity. This includes actions to reduce plastic packaging and food waste and lessen our climate impact, and efforts to lead the transition to sustainable protein. We do not currently incorporate Indigenous knowledge into actions on biodiversity and ecosystems or use any biodiversity offsets. Standards of Engagement According to our Standards of Engagement 4.0, which is being rolled out over the coming years, we expect our suppliers to: ó Comply with all applicable environmental legislation and maintain all relevant permits, including, but not limited to, deforestation and/or land conversion (e.g., EU Regulation on deforestation-free products) and agro-chemical and pesticide storage, use and management ó Not source materials associated with deforestation or land conversion, in line with the respective cut-off dates prescribed by legislation and/or by relevant standards (e.g., Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) See also Workers in the value chain for more information about our Standards of Engagement. Deforestation and land conversion Ahold Delhaize and its brands aim to be 100% deforestation and land conversion free for own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil, tea, soy and wood fiber by 2025. We achieve this by: ó Sourcing own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil and tea that are, as much as possible, certified against an accepted standard ó Sourcing high-risk (South American) soy volume in own-brand supply chains covered by accepted physical certification or credits ó Sourcing own-brand wood fiber-based products and packaging either certified against an accepted standard, classified as low-risk or recycled The requirements for accepted standards and credits are set out in the Sustainability notes. Sustainable and regenerative agriculture The Ahold Delhaize brands support sustainable and/or regenerative agriculture through multiple channels, including: ó Use of standards and certifications ó Establishment of brand-specific farming programs ó Partnerships with suppliers ó Support for NGOs and farming groups Agriculture is a place-based science, which means that the most appropriate sustainable or regenerative practices will differ according to the local region, climate, crop and farm environment. Many of our brands work with initiatives such as the GLOBALG.A.P. to contribute to sustainable agriculture in their upstream value chains. Our brands are working to further integrate sustainable agriculture expectations into sourcing requirements. Many work directly with suppliers to adopt sustainable agriculture practices that include conserving natural resources, reducing land conversion and improving soil health. In addition, this year, our U.S. and Belgian brands announced regenerative agriculture pilots in partnership with our suppliers. These pilots focused on commodities, such as wheat and oats. Following the completion of these pilots, we will identify key learnings and share them across the brands. These activities relate to the mitigation hierarchy layers of avoiding, minimizing and regenerating nature.

"More sustainable consumption patterns We aim to encourage customers, for example, through our product offering, to increase their consumption of plant-based proteins, which, when produced sustainably, have fewer environmental impacts than animal-based proteins. See also Climate change: scope 3 key levers for the European activities around transitioning to more plant-based protein. This action relates to the mitigation hierarchy layer of reducing the impact and risk of our supply chains on nature. Annual risks assessments Our brands conduct an annual sustainability risk assessment to identify social and environmental risks linked to our sourcing practices. This assessment considers environmental impacts such as land conversion, pesticide use and water use, as well as a range of social impacts. Our brands use its outputs to inform their ongoing work on these topics in their supply chains. Multi-stakeholder partnerships We know that transitioning to a more sustainable food system will require coordinated action from a variety of actors across governments and NGOs and within food and beverage value chains. For this reason, we are involved in several multi- stakeholder forums centered on critical social and environmental challenges and solutions linked to biodiversity and ecosystems. To advocate progression in supply chains and promote system change: The Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) A multi-stakeholder partnership platform supporting companies in the global transition to deforestation-free supply chains for commodities like palm oil, soy, beef and paper/pulp. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) A global partnership promoting sustainable palm oil production, processing, trade and use through the development and implementation of global standards. The Retailer Palm Oil Group (RPOG) A non-competitive coalition of retail companies committed to using sustainable palm oil in their products, aiming to make sustainable palm oil the norm. The Palm Oil Transparency Coalition (POTC) A pre-competitive coalition working to remove deforestation and exploitation from palm oil production. Focuses on transparency, traceability and sustainability in palm oil supply chains through, for example, their annual trader assessment. Multi-stakeholder collaboration Focus The Round Table for Responsible Soy (RTRS) Promotes responsible soy production, processing, trade and use. Develops and implements global certification standards for sustainable soy. The Retailer Soy Group (RSG) A non-competitive group of retail companies committed to increasing the use of sustainable soy in their products, aiming to make sustainable soy the norm and increase transparency in the soy supply chains. Transitioning farming systems: Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Regenerating Together Group Ahold Delhaize was a founding member of the SAI’s “Regenerating Together” group and subsequent program. The working group has members spanning food value chains and supports the development of a regenerative agriculture framework. Multi-stakeholder collaboration Focus How we measure our performance To measure our performance, we have the following ambition in place addressing land conversion and deforestation, which is focused on the sourcing of own-brand critical commodities: Timeline Ambition Short term By 2025, Ahold Delhaize and its brands aim to be 100% deforestation- and land- conversion free for own-brand products containing soy, palm oil, cocoa, coffee, wood fiber and tea. We refer to no deforestation or land conversion as defined by the Accountability Framework Initiative or the Forest Resources Assessment. The cut-off date we use is December 31, 2020, or the date of the applicable certification, whichever is earlier. We achieve this by having: ó 100% of own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil and tea certified against an accepted standard ó 100% of high-risk (South American) soy volume in own-brand supply chains covered by accepted physical certification or credits ó 100% of own-brand wood fiber-based products and packaging either certified against an accepted standard, classified as low-risk or recycled Environmental information: nature continued Biodiversity and ecosystems continued Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2024 129"
"once and fold one cardboard box around them. Smarter, customized packaging means smaller packages, less packaging material and as little empty air as possible, and also a lower carbon footprint per delivered package. Our brands support responsible forest management by using, as much as possible, 100% Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)- or Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)-certified paper and cardboard. See also the wood fiber critical commodity indicator included under Biodiversity and ecosystems. To increase the recycling of different packaging materials, a number of our brands also offer recycling stations at their stores, where customers can deposit materials like glass, paper and batteries for recycling. Some of our brands also provide facilities to collect plastic and glass bottles, specifically in cases where there are deposits on the bottles, such as in the Netherlands. The recently adopted EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation will harmonize packaging rules across all the member states. Ahold Delhaize is developing a compliance plan to align with this. It will be applied to all packaging placed on the EU market and all packaging waste referenced in the regulation. Partnerships We also work with several umbrella organizations to find solutions for sustainable packaging. Some of our brands are members of national plastic pacts that are implementing solutions toward a circular economy for plastic. For example, Albert Heijn is a member of the Dutch Plastics Pact, while Ahold Delhaize USA is a member of the U.S. Plastics Pact and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, a membership-based collaborative that believes in the power of industry to make packaging more sustainable. How we measure our performance Consistent with the disclosure in our Annual Report 2023, we expect that we will not achieve our targets related to RRC and recycled content, due to issues ranging from the scaling up of reusable packaging to the availability of a robust recycling infrastructure for certain plastic packaging categories within some of our brands’ markets. See also the key findings from the The Global Commitment 2024 progress report above. However, we have already surpassed our virgin plastic reduction target. To measure our performance, we have the following targets in place: Timeline Target Short term 100% of primary own-brand plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable in practice and at scale by 2025. By 2025, our brands aim to reduce the use of virgin plastic in their own-brand primary product packaging by 5% compared to the 2021 baseline. 25% of our total own-brand primary plastic packaging weight will be made from recycled content by 2025. Our targets are voluntary and have been informed by the partnership with the EMF New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, and the scientific resources made available by it. Our current targets on packaging have a time horizon up to the end of 2025. In 2025, we will determine the most appropriate future targets or ambitions and actions going forward, where applicable. We currently do not have targets in place to monitor the progress of our national-brand suppliers have made to reduce the negative environmental impacts of the production, use and disposal of (virgin) plastics, cardboard and other (non-)compostable primary and secondary packaging materials used and sold by Ahold Delhaize's brands, nor do we have targets on packaging materials other than own-brand primary plastic packaging. Therefore, we make use of the transitional provisions on these value chain topics. Metrics As discussed earlier in this section, our metrics are focusing on own-brand primary product packaging. In addition, see also our reporting on total waste in Sustainability notes – Waste, which includes reporting on other types of waste recycled, such as secondary and tertiary packaging materials. The assessment methodology for recyclability follows the guidelines of the EMF New Plastics Economy Global Commitment regarding recyclability of plastic packaging, which means that actual, not technical, recycling is used for reporting. See Sustainability notes – Packaging for more information on our methodology. In several of our brands’ markets, and for several plastic packaging types, actual recycling infrastructure is not yet established, and, as such, the plastics are not reported as recyclable, even though they may technically be recyclable. In the coming year, we will review these targets and look to identify what steps, if any, can be taken to close the gap while maintaining alignment with our overall strategy.

Total weight of virgin plastic packaging totaled 144 thousand tonnes, which is 38 tonnes lower than the previous year and, thus, basically equal to the 2023 number. This reduction in virgin plastic packaging was mostly realized due to a higher percentage of recycled content in plastic content as total plastic packaging volumes increased. In 2024, 15.7% of own- brand plastic product packaging is from recycled content, a 0.9 percentage-point improvement compared to 2023. In 2024, 33% of our own-brand primary plastic packaging was reusable, recyclable or compostable, a 4.3 percentage-point improvement compared to 2023.
