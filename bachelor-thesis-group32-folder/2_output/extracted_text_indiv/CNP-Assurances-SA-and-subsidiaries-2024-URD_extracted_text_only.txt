"88 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information In 2024, CNP Assurances voted at 84 General Meetings of 82 companies in 11 countries. These companies account for 100% of CNP Assurances’ directly held equity portfolio. It voted on 1,717 resolutions, approving 74.6% and opposing 25.3% of them. The negative votes predominantly concerned excessive remuneration for certain senior executives. A breakdown by topic of the votes cast by CNP Assurances is available in the report on its shareholder engagement policy on the cnp.fr website. In 2024, CNP Assurances continued its bilateral dialogues (16 direct dialogues and two dialogues carried out at its request by Ostrum AM) on governance, climate and biodiversity challenges. Engagement is organised with companies in which CNP Assurances is a shareholder or bondholder, as well as with asset management companies. In 2024, 41% of GHG emissions from direct holdings (equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure) were covered by the shareholder engagement work carried out by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries with the management of the companies concerned (bilateral dialogue or letters requesting a halt to new fossil fuel exploration and production projects). ESG-based investment selection CNP Assurances believes that including ESG criteria in investment decision processes contributes to value creation and enhances the risk-return ratio over time. Since 2006, it has implemented a strategy of ESG integration across all asset classes. Details of how ESG criteria are taken into account for each asset class are set out in the transition plan. Green investments Massive investments are needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. These investments contribute to the energy transition and also help CNP Assurances to manage its transition risk. CNP Assurances is committed to increasing its green investment portfolio – green bonds, forests, environment-labelled buildings, green infrastructure such as renewable energy projects and low- carbon transport and mobility projects – to €30 billion by the end of 2025, from €10.4 billion in 2018. As of end-2024, the Group's green investments totalled €29.4 billion. Investments in forests In the forests owned by CNP Assurances, the fight against climate change is based on the natural sequestration of CO2 by trees through photosynthesis. The carbon captured each year by the Group’s forestry assets is monitored by estimating the wood’s organic growth during the year and then converting this biomass growth into captured CO2. In 2024, the gross quantity of CO2 captured by CNP Assurances' forestry assets totalled 483,653 tonnes of CO2. 2.2.1.4 Energy consumption and mix (E1-5) ESRS Reference 2024 E1-5_02 Total fossil energy consumption 6,020 MWh E1-5_15 Share of fossil sources in total energy consumption 28% E1-5_03 Consumption from nuclear sources 131 MWh E1-5_04 Share of consumption from nuclear sources in total energy consumption 1% E1-5_06 Fuel consumption for renewable sources, including biomass (also comprising industrial and municipal waste of biologic origin, biogas, renewable hydrogen, etc.) (MWh) 12 MWh E1-5_07 Consumption of purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam, and cooling from renewable sources 14,956 MWh E1-5_08 Consumption of self-generated non-fuel renewable energy 283 MWh E1-5_05 Total renewable energy consumption 15,252 MWh E1-5_09 Share of renewable sources in total energy consumption 71% E1-5_01 Total energy consumption 21,404 MWh"

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns. Today, they use biomass in the form of acai seeds and sawdust, which used to be major sources of waste in the region. In addition to reducing GHG emissions and easing pressure on the Amazon forest, the project supports the local economy by creating jobs and new markets for local biomass suppliers. The project also creates environmental activities to reduce the impact of the ceramics industry and supports vulnerable groups through several social initiatives. The purchase of carbon credits is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. the following external projects • the Nature Impact fund, an initiative launched by WWF France aimed at financing projects designed to preserve, restore and sustainably manage forests with high biodiversity value in mainland France. The underlying purpose of this fund is to protect 15,000 hectares of woodland in France – the equivalent of a quarter of the woodland that has been placed under “strong protection” by France’s National Forestry Office – while enabling the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over a period of 30 years. This fund is also being financed by La Banque Postale's carbon and biodiversity fund. CNP Assurances does not use the Nature Impact Fund to offset any of its GHG emissions, • in Brazil, in 2024, Caixa Vida e Previdência did not renew the voluntary financing of two projects initiated in 2023, but plans to do so again in 2025. The first of these projects – which is the outcome of a partnership between the Association of Extractive Reserve Residents (ASMOREX) and Biofílica Ambipar – is located in the Rio Preto-Jacundá extractive reserve and is aimed at reducing emissions by preserving forests, and promoting community development, education and healthcare. The second project, located in the town of Parnaíba, contributes to the production of wind power, • also in Brazil, CNP Seguranda set up a project called Conexão Amazônia in partnership with the Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (Idesam), investing R$2.5 million. Through this investment, CNP Seguradora is supporting local non- profits to promote entrepreneurship and create income streams from socio-environmentally responsible value chains such as vegetable oil production, handicrafts and furniture-making. The project helps to support around 500 families facing social problems, improving their quality of life while promoting environmental conservation. CNP Seguradora's support will also enable more than 5,000 trees to be planted to restore deforested areas in the region. The partnership with Idesam was signed in March 2024, during the Brazil-France Economic Forum on The Transition to the Green Economy."

In particular, CNP Assurances considers that its investments could have a negative impact that could result in: • damage to ecosystems and public health [IRO 1]; • depletion of resources [IRO 1]; • biodiversity loss [IRO 1]. Reducing these negative impacts requires a responsible investment strategy. The general responsible investing approach applied by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries(1) is tailored to the specific nature of each asset class. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ approach is based on the principles of the Responsible Investment Charter and guided by the Global Compact principles, including protecting the environment. This approach contributes to seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Policies and actions relating to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) are based on the pillars of CNP Assurances’ responsible investment strategy: • exclusion policy (1); • non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets (2); • shareholder engagement policy (3). The responsible investment strategy is defined as part of the investment strategy approved by Executive Management and the Board of Directors. A dedicated responsible investment governance structure has been set up to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Management, the relevant committees and the investment teams to integrate ESG issues into their decision-making and operational processes. The governance framework in place to implement and track these policies is described in section 2.1.2.1 entitled “Role of administrative, management and supervisory bodies (GOV-1)”. The stakeholders consulted are detailed in section 2.1.3.2 “Interests and views of stakeholders (SBM‐2)”. The resources allocated to sustainable finance within CNP Assurances are detailed in section 2.2.1.1 “Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1).” 2.2.2.1 Exclusion policy CNP Assurances excludes certain countries and companies from their investments on the basis of ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. In particular, some companies are excluded because they are involved in activities that may have a negative impact on the environment. The specific exclusion criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2‐2), water and marine resources (E3-2), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4-3) and resource use and circular economy (E5‐2) – are described in the sections below about the actions and resources related to each matter.

This criterion particularly includes elements relating to waste management and packaging. Taking resources and the circular economy into account in real estate The Green Works Charter requires management companies of the properties held directly by CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries to carry out work in accordance with the principles of this charter, particularly in terms of the circular economy: • materials and technologies used: • use materials or technologies with a limited impact on the environment, • promote the use of recycled or recyclable materials, • conduct a critical analysis prior to the use of new processes or products that are theoretically more environmentally friendly; • works phase: • draft an organisational plan of the site, • manage and recycle waste, • limit consumption of resources, • Perform eco-monitoring of the site; • management of activity waste: • reduce waste at source, • implement waste sorting, • treat and reuse waste and track its collection, • assess the amount of waste produced; • circular economy: • assess the possibility of using deconstruction processes to recover and reuse materials wherever possible for each operation, • promote the use of recycled materials from wherever possible. The management companies are responsible for the risks associated with this charter. CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries expect them to manage these risks in an appropriate and balanced manner on a case-by-case basis depending on the materiality of the challenge in question."

Taking resources and the circular economy into account in real estate The Green Works Charter requires management companies of the properties held directly by CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries to carry out work in accordance with the principles of this charter, particularly in terms of the circular economy: • materials and technologies used: • use materials or technologies with a limited impact on the environment, • promote the use of recycled or recyclable materials, • conduct a critical analysis prior to the use of new processes or products that are theoretically more environmentally friendly; • works phase: • draft an organisational plan of the site, • manage and recycle waste, • limit consumption of resources, • Perform eco-monitoring of the site; • management of activity waste: • reduce waste at source, • implement waste sorting, • treat and reuse waste and track its collection, • assess the amount of waste produced; • circular economy: • assess the possibility of using deconstruction processes to recover and reuse materials wherever possible for each operation, • promote the use of recycled materials from wherever possible. The management companies are responsible for the risks associated with this charter. CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries expect them to manage these risks in an appropriate and balanced manner on a case-by-case basis depending on the materiality of the challenge in question."
"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 93 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.2.2 Non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets ESG filters for listed equities and bonds For directly-held equities and corporate bonds, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries use a best-in- class approach for their investment selection, applying the ESG filters used for the GREaT(1) non-financial analysis methodology. Corporate issuers’ non-financial ratings are calculated using this method, which makes it possible to carry out pragmatic and differentiating analyses of companies with regard to sustainable development challenges, and taking into account negative impacts. The “GREaT” methodology measures commitment and responsibility across four pillars, including sustainable management of environmental and human resources. This pillar assesses the sustainable management of human and natural resources, minimises the company’s negative impact on its ecosystem, and promotes companies that nurture their human capital. The specific criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) – are described in their corresponding sections. The Green Works property management charter Real estate has a significant impact on the environment, both in the construction and operating phases. The Green Works Charter sets rules that must be followed by the companies that manage the portfolios of real estate directly held by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries in order to limit pollution, reduce water consumption, track the use of resources and promote the circular economy. The ESG criteria are defined in operational terms in the property management mandate. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ real estate asset management companies undertake to carry out works in accordance with the rules of this charter, particularly in relation to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5).

CNP Assurances expects them to manage these risks in a balanced and appropriate manner on a case-by-case basis, depending on the materiality of the matter in question. The policy of selecting investments on the basis of ESG criteria is also used for other asset classes. This policy is detailed in the Climate Transition Plan. 2.2.2.3 Shareholder engagement and voting policy At the general meetings of listed companies in the portfolio, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries defend the interests of their policyholders and put their ESG commitments into practice. They also engage in dialogue with investee companies and asset managers, face-to-face or by letter, to encourage them to reduce their negative impacts. CNP Assurances applies its voting policy pragmatically, in some cases taking into account the specific characteristics of each company, such as business sector, national regulations, main ESG risks, size, shareholder structure, and economic and financial circumstances. CNP Assurances does not have specific targets for ESRS E2, E3 (including water and sustainable oceans and seas) and E5. The specific targets related to ESRS E4 are described in the ESRS E4 section on biodiversity and ecosystems.
