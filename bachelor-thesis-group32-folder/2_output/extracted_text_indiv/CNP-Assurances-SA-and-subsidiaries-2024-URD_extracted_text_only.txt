"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 71 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.1.1 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Every year, when renewing its membership of the UN Global Compact, CNP Assurances reaffirms its determination to manage its impact on the environment. The company is committed to supporting the transition towards a low-carbon, resilient economy that does not destroy natural resources. This commitment is based on setting ambitious targets in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation, monitoring the environmental impact of CNP Assurances’ activities (investment, insurance and internal operations) and taking steps to reduce this impact and achieve the targets set. GHG emissions reduction targets set for internal operations CNP Assurances has undertaken to reduce direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) GHG emissions from internal operations by 50% between 2019 and 2030. This objective is in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to limit global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C). The emissions concerned include direct emissions (Scope 1) and emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2). Baseline value (2019) Target value (2030) Reduction target (%) Value in 2024 2024 Achievement rate Scope Location-based Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reported in 2023 incl. Cyprus 6,774 teqCO2 3,387 teqCO2 50% N/A(1) N/A CNP Assurances SA and its subsidiaries Location-based Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions excl. Cyprus 5,580 teqCO2 2,790 teqCO2 50% 2,431 teqCO2 113% CNP Assurances SA and its subsidiaries CNP Cyprus Insurance Holdings (CIH) has been removed from the base year in order to enable meaningful year-on-year comparisons. This subsidiary in Cyprus, which has now been sold, was a significant contributor to the GHG emissions from internal operations of CNP Assurances. Scope 3 emissions from internal operations are not included in the scope of the emissions reduction targets, but are subject to mitigation measures, as presented in the section 2.2.1.3 “Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3)”. GHG emissions reduction targets for the investment portfolio In 2019, CNP Assurances joined the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and committed to achieving carbon neutrality in its investment portfolio by 2050. Launched in September 2019 at the United Nations Climate Action Summit, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance is a member- led initiative of over 80 institutional investors managing $9,500 billion in investments, that are committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050. By targeting the transition of their portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions, Alliance members hope to help limit global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement. The Alliance is inviting many other institutional investors to join their effort, in order to rapidly achieve critical mass and play a key role in decarbonising the global economy and investing in climate change resilience. As part of this long-term commitment, CNP Assurances and the other members of the Alliance will take into account advances in available scientific knowledge, particularly the conclusions of the IPCC, and will regularly report on the progress made by setting interim objectives every five years to 2050. Joining the Alliance involves implementing three action levers: regularly measuring the investment portfolio’s alignment with the Paris Agreement and publishing the progress made, maintaining shareholder dialogue with investee companies to ensure they are also targeting carbon neutrality, and lobbying for public policies that promote the transition to a decarbonised economy. Following a stakeholder consultation in 2020, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance published its inaugural Target-Setting Protocol in January 2021. The protocol described how Alliance members would set climate targets to be achieved by 2025, based on current scientific knowledge when the targets were set. The protocol is updated annually to expand its coverage and take account of advances in available scientific knowledge, including the conclusions of the IPCC. The initial targets set by CNP Assurances in February 2021 have since been revised to reflect the latest published recommendations. At 31 December 2024, CNP Assurances' investment portfolio, all asset classes combined, totalled more than €412 billion(2). Decarbonisation trajectories aligned with the Paris Agreement cover €114 billion(3) of investments in directly-held equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure assets, the portfolio of properties held directly through club deals and the Lamartine fund, and directly-held shares and bonds issued by electricity producers, together representing approximately 28% of CNP Assurances’ total investment portfolio(4). (1) As Cyprus Insurance Holdings (CIH) is in the process of being sold and outside the CSRD scope of consolidation, CNP Assurances is not able to determine GHG emissions including CIH for 2024 (2) Includes the investments of CNP UniCredit Vita, which was in the process of being sold at 31 December 2014 (3) 70% of which is covered by carbon emissions disclosures (4) The decarbonisation pathways cover investments made by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries"
"72 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information Targets aligned with a 1.5°C trajectory CNP Assurances' objectives are based on the recommendations of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, as set out in the Target-Setting Protocol (4th edition). Since data are not always available for all asset classes, the calculation was done in a continuous improvement perspective. Participation in the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance projects will help fine-tune the results year by year. Method for aligning the reduction in the carbon footprint of the portfolio of directly-held equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure assets. The target of a 53% reduction in the carbon footprint of the portfolio of equities, corporate bonds and infrastructures held directly by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries between 2019 and 2029 is in line with the IPCC's trajectories with little or no risk of global warming exceeding 1.5°C (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report). The target covers Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions) and Scope 2 emissions (indirect energy-related emissions) where the data are published by the investee companies. Method for aligning the reduction in the carbon footprint of the property portfolio The target of a 32% reduction per square metre in the carbon footprint of the portfolio of properties held directly through club deals and the Lamartine fund between 2019 and 2029 is in line with the 1.5°C trajectories published by the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM). The trajectory for CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries was modelled using the CRREM scenarios, taking into account the type of asset (offices, retail units, residential units, warehouses) and the geographical location of the properties held directly by CNP Assurances. The trajectory modelled in this way requires a reduction of 32% per square metre to limit the risk of global warming exceeding 1.5°C. The target covers actual or estimated Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect energy-related emissions) emissions from the buildings in the portfolio. Method for aligning the reduction in the carbon intensity of electricity producers The objective of reducing the carbon intensity of electricity producers directly held by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries by 17% between 2019 and 2024 is in line with the 1.5°C trajectories of the One-Earth Climate Model (OECM). The trajectory was modelled using the OECM scenarios, taking into account the geographical location of directly held electricity producer capacity, estimated at 50% in Europe and 50% in the rest of the world. The modelled trajectory is the average of the 1.5°C trajectories for Europe and the world. It requires an average carbon intensity of 216 kgeqCO2/MWh in 2024 to limit the risk of global warming exceeding 1.5°C, representing a 17% reduction compared with the average carbon intensity of the electricity producers held directly by CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries in 2019 (259 kgeqCO2/MWh). The objective covers Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect energy-related emissions) emissions generated by the production of electricity, where the data are published by the investee companies. Method for aligning coal exposure in the investment portfolio CNP Assurances is committed to achieving zero exposure to thermal coal in its investment portfolio in the European Union and OECD countries by 2030, and the rest of the world by 2040. This commitment corresponds to the 1.5°C global warming scenario developed by Climate Analytics based on complete withdrawal from the coal sector in the European Union and OECD countries by 2030, and in the rest of the world by 2040. The Group measures its exposure through its direct investments by covering the entire value chain and weighting the exposure to each investee company by the proportion of revenue derived from thermal coal."

The two dimensions covered by the double materiality assessment are as follows: • impact materiality, corresponding to the material positive or negative, actual or potential impacts on the environment and people connected with the undertaking’s own operations and value chain; • financial materiality, corresponding to the positive effects (opportunities) and negative effects (risks) of sustainability matters on the undertaking's financial performance. CNP Assurances’ assessment covers its entire value chain, including internal operations, insurance activities, investing activities, and all upstream and downstream value chain activities. A more detailed description of the value chain is provided below. The assessment is conducted in three stages: (1) identification of Impacts, Risks and Opportunities, (2) their assessment and (3) setting of a materiality threshold, which determines the content of the Sustainability Statement. Identification of impacts, risks and opportunities The first step in the double materiality assessment consists of drawing up the list of Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs), based on the following principles: • all the sustainability topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics listed in Appendix A (AR 16) of ESRS 1 are considered. Some of the sub-topics have been merged to focus the list of IROs on activities where CNP Assurances is likely to have a negative impact, and some sub-topics have been excluded because they are not related to CNP Assurances' business; • preparation of the list is based on the existing risk maps, such as the Group risk map and the duty of care risk map, as well as the list of risks previously used to prepare the NFPS; • in addition, certain dependencies are identified, such as economic dependence on a service provider, or exposure to assets dependent on services that are part of an ecosystem qualified as being at risk; • IROs are determined for the entire CNP Assurances upstream and downstream value chain; • the IROs are considered on a gross basis, i.e., without taking into account the action plans implemented by the Group to prevent, mitigate or remedy the occurrence of risks and negative impacts, or to amplify the positive impacts and opportunities; • the description of the process of assessing climate impacts and risks, and in particular the reference climate scenarios used, are described in the ESRS E1 climate change transition plan. Impact, risk and opportunity assessment Each impact, risk and opportunity was assessed to determine the level of materiality of the sustainability topics. This assessment will be reviewed annually from 2025. The positive or negative, actual or potential impacts were assessed according to the following criteria: • scale, corresponding to the degree of severity of the impact’s consequences for the stakeholder concerned in the short term (less than 1 year) and medium term (between 1 and 5 years); • scope, corresponding to the extent of the impact’s consequences for the stakeholder concerned in the short/ medium term. This includes the geographical scope for environmental matters, and the number of people affected for social matters; • irremediable character of the impact, corresponding to impacts that cannot be remedied in the short to medium term. This criterion only applies to negative impacts; • likelihood of occurrence; • long-term impact, when the impact’s materiality is assessed as being greater over the long term (more than five years). In accordance with ESRS 1, an exception applies to negative human rights impacts for which the severity of the impact takes precedence over its likelihood."

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 71 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.1.1 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Every year, when renewing its membership of the UN Global Compact, CNP Assurances reaffirms its determination to manage its impact on the environment. The company is committed to supporting the transition towards a low-carbon, resilient economy that does not destroy natural resources. This commitment is based on setting ambitious targets in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation, monitoring the environmental impact of CNP Assurances’ activities (investment, insurance and internal operations) and taking steps to reduce this impact and achieve the targets set. GHG emissions reduction targets set for internal operations CNP Assurances has undertaken to reduce direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) GHG emissions from internal operations by 50% between 2019 and 2030. This objective is in line with the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to limit global warming to 1.5°C (IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C). The emissions concerned include direct emissions (Scope 1) and emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2). Baseline value (2019) Target value (2030) Reduction target (%) Value in 2024 2024 Achievement rate Scope Location-based Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reported in 2023 incl.

Cyprus 5,580 teqCO2 2,790 teqCO2 50% 2,431 teqCO2 113% CNP Assurances SA and its subsidiaries CNP Cyprus Insurance Holdings (CIH) has been removed from the base year in order to enable meaningful year-on-year comparisons. This subsidiary in Cyprus, which has now been sold, was a significant contributor to the GHG emissions from internal operations of CNP Assurances. Scope 3 emissions from internal operations are not included in the scope of the emissions reduction targets, but are subject to mitigation measures, as presented in the section 2.2.1.3 “Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3)”. GHG emissions reduction targets for the investment portfolio In 2019, CNP Assurances joined the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and committed to achieving carbon neutrality in its investment portfolio by 2050. Launched in September 2019 at the United Nations Climate Action Summit, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance is a member- led initiative of over 80 institutional investors managing $9,500 billion in investments, that are committed to transitioning their investment portfolios to net zero GHG emissions by 2050. By targeting the transition of their portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions, Alliance members hope to help limit global warming to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement. The Alliance is inviting many other institutional investors to join their effort, in order to rapidly achieve critical mass and play a key role in decarbonising the global economy and investing in climate change resilience. As part of this long-term commitment, CNP Assurances and the other members of the Alliance will take into account advances in available scientific knowledge, particularly the conclusions of the IPCC, and will regularly report on the progress made by setting interim objectives every five years to 2050. Joining the Alliance involves implementing three action levers: regularly measuring the investment portfolio’s alignment with the Paris Agreement and publishing the progress made, maintaining shareholder dialogue with investee companies to ensure they are also targeting carbon neutrality, and lobbying for public policies that promote the transition to a decarbonised economy. Following a stakeholder consultation in 2020, the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance published its inaugural Target-Setting Protocol in January 2021. The protocol described how Alliance members would set climate targets to be achieved by 2025, based on current scientific knowledge when the targets were set. The protocol is updated annually to expand its coverage and take account of advances in available scientific knowledge, including the conclusions of the IPCC. The initial targets set by CNP Assurances in February 2021 have since been revised to reflect the latest published recommendations. At 31 December 2024, CNP Assurances' investment portfolio, all asset classes combined, totalled more than €412 billion(2). Decarbonisation trajectories aligned with the Paris Agreement cover €114 billion(3) of investments in directly-held equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure assets, the portfolio of properties held directly through club deals and the Lamartine fund, and directly-held shares and bonds issued by electricity producers, together representing approximately 28% of CNP Assurances’ total investment portfolio(4). (1) As Cyprus Insurance Holdings (CIH) is in the process of being sold and outside the CSRD scope of consolidation, CNP Assurances is not able to determine GHG emissions including CIH for 2024 (2) Includes the investments of CNP UniCredit Vita, which was in the process of being sold at 31 December 2014 (3) 70% of which is covered by carbon emissions disclosures (4) The decarbonisation pathways cover investments made by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries"
"72 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information Targets aligned with a 1.5°C trajectory CNP Assurances' objectives are based on the recommendations of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, as set out in the Target-Setting Protocol (4th edition). Since data are not always available for all asset classes, the calculation was done in a continuous improvement perspective. Participation in the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance projects will help fine-tune the results year by year. Method for aligning the reduction in the carbon footprint of the portfolio of directly-held equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure assets. The target of a 53% reduction in the carbon footprint of the portfolio of equities, corporate bonds and infrastructures held directly by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries between 2019 and 2029 is in line with the IPCC's trajectories with little or no risk of global warming exceeding 1.5°C (IPCC Sixth Assessment Report). The target covers Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions) and Scope 2 emissions (indirect energy-related emissions) where the data are published by the investee companies. Method for aligning the reduction in the carbon footprint of the property portfolio The target of a 32% reduction per square metre in the carbon footprint of the portfolio of properties held directly through club deals and the Lamartine fund between 2019 and 2029 is in line with the 1.5°C trajectories published by the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM). The trajectory for CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries was modelled using the CRREM scenarios, taking into account the type of asset (offices, retail units, residential units, warehouses) and the geographical location of the properties held directly by CNP Assurances. The trajectory modelled in this way requires a reduction of 32% per square metre to limit the risk of global warming exceeding 1.5°C. The target covers actual or estimated Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect energy-related emissions) emissions from the buildings in the portfolio. Method for aligning the reduction in the carbon intensity of electricity producers The objective of reducing the carbon intensity of electricity producers directly held by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries by 17% between 2019 and 2024 is in line with the 1.5°C trajectories of the One-Earth Climate Model (OECM). The trajectory was modelled using the OECM scenarios, taking into account the geographical location of directly held electricity producer capacity, estimated at 50% in Europe and 50% in the rest of the world. The modelled trajectory is the average of the 1.5°C trajectories for Europe and the world. It requires an average carbon intensity of 216 kgeqCO2/MWh in 2024 to limit the risk of global warming exceeding 1.5°C, representing a 17% reduction compared with the average carbon intensity of the electricity producers held directly by CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries in 2019 (259 kgeqCO2/MWh). The objective covers Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect energy-related emissions) emissions generated by the production of electricity, where the data are published by the investee companies. Method for aligning coal exposure in the investment portfolio CNP Assurances is committed to achieving zero exposure to thermal coal in its investment portfolio in the European Union and OECD countries by 2030, and the rest of the world by 2040. This commitment corresponds to the 1.5°C global warming scenario developed by Climate Analytics based on complete withdrawal from the coal sector in the European Union and OECD countries by 2030, and in the rest of the world by 2040. The Group measures its exposure through its direct investments by covering the entire value chain and weighting the exposure to each investee company by the proportion of revenue derived from thermal coal."
"86 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.1.4 Beyond carbon Biodiversity Disclosure requirements concerning major biodiversity matters are presented in ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystems Climate change adaptation Mitigation efforts are no longer enough and adaptation to climate change is now essential to reduce the vulnerability of populations to its negative effects. It is estimated that average temperatures have increased by 1.1°C compared to pre- industrial levels and global warming is projected to hit 3.1°C by the end of the century. As a result, adaptation efforts are now urgently needed to protect populations and ecosystems. At a time when public finances are under pressure, it is essential to mobilise companies that are engaged and ready to contribute over the long term. This is where insurers and investors can play a major role by supporting sustainable projects and developing appropriate insurance mechanisms. The first step in adapting to climate change is to measure the physical risks so that action plans can be put in place to reduce them if necessary. CNP Assurances has conducted several studies to measure the physical risks in its value chain and has taken action where appropriate to address these risks, as explained below. Exposure of investments in countries, companies, buildings or forests to climate hazards Several studies conducted by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries on the physical risks associated with the investment portfolio have highlighted the exposure of certain countries, companies, buildings or forests to various climate hazards. The objective of CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries, based on the studies and data currently available, is to limit this exposure through appropriate investment decisions. Management of these investments is based on ESG analyses that include climate risks. Adaptation plans for forestry assets have been in place for many years. The manager of these assets, Société Forestière de la Caisse des Dépôts, has been working to reduce their exposure to the risks associated with climate change based on an analysis covering four areas: the management plan, insurance coverage, geographical diversity, and diversity of species. In 2023, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries updated their analysis of the physical risk exposure of their property portfolios, taking into account local physical risks and each building’s characteristics. Adaptation plans for the most exposed assets were drawn up in 2024. The Group’s dialogue with companies in the portfolio pursuant to the shareholder engagement policy includes discussions on how they manage their physical risk exposures. Estimating the impacts of climate change on mortality, morbidity and the occurrence of natural disasters that affect claims experience To reduce the impact of climate risks on its insurance business, CNP Assurances follows a broad-based approach to protection, including for climate risks, by purchasing reinsurance cover against the risk of higher-than-expected mortality rates. All causes of higher‐than‐expected mortality are taken into account, ranging from pandemics to heatwaves. Life and non-life reinsurance programmes offer CNP Assurances protection against the occurrence of natural disasters that are likely to be more severe and occur more frequently in the coming decades due to global warming. CNP Assurances closely monitors developments in respect of these reinsurance treaties, which are particularly sensitive to physical risks. The Group also contributes to the process of adapting to climate change through the death, temporary and permanent disability and health cover provided by its insurance policies (group health and personal risk insurance, individual health and personal risk insurance, term creditor insurance). These products cover death, lost-time accidents or illness, medical consultations, hospitalisation costs and medical expenses incurred by policyholders following a natural disaster (flood, drought, storm, etc.), a heatwave or a vector-borne disease (dengue, chikungunya, etc.), the frequency and severity of which are likely to increase in the coming years as a result of global warming. Estimating the risk to business continuity in the event of extreme weather events Concerning internal operations, the offices and employees of CNP Assurances SA and its subsidiaries are located in countries (approximately 75% in Europe and 25% in Latin America) which, due to their level of development, are not considered as being the most vulnerable to weather events likely to severely disrupt their operations. Physical risks associated with the Group’s internal operations are managed by regularly updating contingency plans, in order to ensure that staff would be able to continue working following a weather event. Just transition As investors, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries endeavour to have a positive impact on society as a whole. As a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), and in line with its firm belief that taking ESG criteria into account when assessing an investment contributes to value creation and optimises the yield-to-risk ratio over time, CNP Assurances applies a responsible investor strategy. The four principles guiding the integration of ESG criteria in the investment policy are as follows: • ensure respect for human rights as defined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; • ensure compliance with the International Labour Organization (ILO) Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; • promote the protection of the environment, the energy and environmental transition, and initiatives to reduce or adapt to climate change; • contribute to the fight against corruption. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries receive ESG risk alerts concerning companies in their portfolios. The alerts are triggered by the ESG analyses performed by the asset manager, Ostrum AM, and are discussed at the quarterly meetings of the SRI Committee made up of representatives of both CNP Assurances and Ostrum AM. When an alert corresponds to a breach of the fundamental principles of the Global Compact, CNP Assurances asks Ostrum AM to engage with the company in question. If at the end of this engagement, no quick remedy to the situation can be found, CNP Assurances may decide to exclude the company from the investment portfolio."
"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 87 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information Since 2022, the just transition has been addressed in the shareholder engagement policies applied by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries. CNP Assurances is a founding member of the first global investor engagement coalition on the just transition. The coalition's shareholder engagement policy aims to encourage companies to include in their strategy the social impacts of the transition to a low-carbon economy. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries took part in the work that led to the publication in 2024 of an initial awareness-raising grid for investors, and also supported collaborative engagement of the coalition members. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries include consideration of the social impacts of climate transition plans in their analysis of Say-on-Climate resolutions. 2.2.1.2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-2) CNP Assurances’ policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation are described in section 2.2.2.1 “Climate change mitigation transition plan (E1-1)”. 2.2.1.3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3) Actions taken and resources allocated to achieve climate change mitigation for internal operations Adapting premises to climate change For a number of years now, CNP Assurances has integrated climate change adaptation into its process of selecting office premises, choosing buildings that meet exacting environmental standards. • in 2022, CNP Assurances transferred its headquarters to Issy-les-Moulineaux, to a building that meets the latest environmental standards (HQE Exceptional, BREEAM Outstanding, and BEPOS positive energy certification); • towards the end of 2023, CVA moved into a new V4 LEED Platinum-certified headquarters building in Milan. The building has been completely renovated to high standards of energy performance, based on an integrated and systemic strategy; • in 2024, CNP UniCredit Vita carried out a maintenance and restructuring project to improve the energy efficiency of its two office buildings, obtaining LEED Gold certification in December; • CNP Luxembourg has launched a project to relocate in 2025 to a building that meets the latest ESG criteria. The move will radically reduce the company’s carbon footprint compared with the two old buildings that it currently leases; • towards the end of 2023, CNP Santander relocated to a building with a high energy performance; • in Brazil, Caixa Vida e Previdência improved its energy efficiency management in 2024 by adopting measures such as the use of exclusively-LED light bulbs, lighting automation systems with luminosity sensors, and efficient air conditioning equipment. Its buildings in São Paulo and Barueri are LEED® Gold and Platinum-certified, respectively, and are in the process of obtaining LEED Interior Design and Construction (ID+C) certification; • Youse operates from a building with two LEED certifications: Gold for maintenance and operation and Silver for construction; • CNP Seguradora’s Barueri offices are in a LEED Gold- certified building, while its Berrini office building has LEED Platinum certification and obtains all of its energy from the free energy market. Promoting energy sufficiency and digital technologies CNP Assurances has adopted an energy-efficiency policy that focuses on improving the operation of heating, air-conditioning and ventilation systems through expert management of programmable time settings. Since 2022, it has applied a policy of setting heating to a maximum of 19°C and switching off neon signs at night. The Group has joined the EcoWatt responsible energy consumption initiative and is committed to reducing its consumption in periods of peak energy demand. IT processing centres and workstations are two key features of the digital transformation, and it is vital that the Group remains vigilant about their energy consumption. A pilot project is also under way to cut down on the energy used for ICT and data infrastructure. Employee awareness-raising and training CNP Assurances has set up a ""Green Actions"" programme to raise employee awareness about the need to reduce its environmental footprint. A Group charter has been sent out to all employees, inviting them to respect ecological principles such as sorting waste, reducing digital pollution and being energy efficient. In 2021, sustainable finance training was offered to 2,487 employees, covering 75% of the workforce. In 2023, 86% of the Group's employees followed an e-learning course on the ecological crisis, developed in partnership with well-known specialist networks. ""Climate Fresk” workshops have also been organised to help give employees a better understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change. Investing activities Sector exclusion policy CNP Assurances excludes from their investments companies linked to climate change impacts, such as those in the conventional or non-conventional coal, oil and fossil gas sectors. These policies are set out in the Climate Transition Plan. Shareholder engagement policy At the general meetings of listed companies in the portfolio, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries defend the interests of their policyholders and put their ESG commitments into practice by making their support for Say-on-Climate resolutions dependent on strict and clearly-defined criteria. They also engage in dialogue with investee companies and asset managers, face-to-face or by letter, to encourage them to reduce their impact on climate change while protecting their employees from the effects of the transition."
"88 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information In 2024, CNP Assurances voted at 84 General Meetings of 82 companies in 11 countries. These companies account for 100% of CNP Assurances’ directly held equity portfolio. It voted on 1,717 resolutions, approving 74.6% and opposing 25.3% of them. The negative votes predominantly concerned excessive remuneration for certain senior executives. A breakdown by topic of the votes cast by CNP Assurances is available in the report on its shareholder engagement policy on the cnp.fr website. In 2024, CNP Assurances continued its bilateral dialogues (16 direct dialogues and two dialogues carried out at its request by Ostrum AM) on governance, climate and biodiversity challenges. Engagement is organised with companies in which CNP Assurances is a shareholder or bondholder, as well as with asset management companies. In 2024, 41% of GHG emissions from direct holdings (equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure) were covered by the shareholder engagement work carried out by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries with the management of the companies concerned (bilateral dialogue or letters requesting a halt to new fossil fuel exploration and production projects). ESG-based investment selection CNP Assurances believes that including ESG criteria in investment decision processes contributes to value creation and enhances the risk-return ratio over time. Since 2006, it has implemented a strategy of ESG integration across all asset classes. Details of how ESG criteria are taken into account for each asset class are set out in the transition plan. Green investments Massive investments are needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. These investments contribute to the energy transition and also help CNP Assurances to manage its transition risk. CNP Assurances is committed to increasing its green investment portfolio – green bonds, forests, environment-labelled buildings, green infrastructure such as renewable energy projects and low- carbon transport and mobility projects – to €30 billion by the end of 2025, from €10.4 billion in 2018. As of end-2024, the Group's green investments totalled €29.4 billion. Investments in forests In the forests owned by CNP Assurances, the fight against climate change is based on the natural sequestration of CO2 by trees through photosynthesis. The carbon captured each year by the Group’s forestry assets is monitored by estimating the wood’s organic growth during the year and then converting this biomass growth into captured CO2. In 2024, the gross quantity of CO2 captured by CNP Assurances' forestry assets totalled 483,653 tonnes of CO2. 2.2.1.4 Energy consumption and mix (E1-5) ESRS Reference 2024 E1-5_02 Total fossil energy consumption 6,020 MWh E1-5_15 Share of fossil sources in total energy consumption 28% E1-5_03 Consumption from nuclear sources 131 MWh E1-5_04 Share of consumption from nuclear sources in total energy consumption 1% E1-5_06 Fuel consumption for renewable sources, including biomass (also comprising industrial and municipal waste of biologic origin, biogas, renewable hydrogen, etc.) (MWh) 12 MWh E1-5_07 Consumption of purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam, and cooling from renewable sources 14,956 MWh E1-5_08 Consumption of self-generated non-fuel renewable energy 283 MWh E1-5_05 Total renewable energy consumption 15,252 MWh E1-5_09 Share of renewable sources in total energy consumption 71% E1-5_01 Total energy consumption 21,404 MWh"

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 87 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information Since 2022, the just transition has been addressed in the shareholder engagement policies applied by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries. CNP Assurances is a founding member of the first global investor engagement coalition on the just transition. The coalition's shareholder engagement policy aims to encourage companies to include in their strategy the social impacts of the transition to a low-carbon economy. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries took part in the work that led to the publication in 2024 of an initial awareness-raising grid for investors, and also supported collaborative engagement of the coalition members. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries include consideration of the social impacts of climate transition plans in their analysis of Say-on-Climate resolutions. 2.2.1.2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-2) CNP Assurances’ policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation are described in section 2.2.2.1 “Climate change mitigation transition plan (E1-1)”. 2.2.1.3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3) Actions taken and resources allocated to achieve climate change mitigation for internal operations Adapting premises to climate change For a number of years now, CNP Assurances has integrated climate change adaptation into its process of selecting office premises, choosing buildings that meet exacting environmental standards. • in 2022, CNP Assurances transferred its headquarters to Issy-les-Moulineaux, to a building that meets the latest environmental standards (HQE Exceptional, BREEAM Outstanding, and BEPOS positive energy certification); • towards the end of 2023, CVA moved into a new V4 LEED Platinum-certified headquarters building in Milan. The building has been completely renovated to high standards of energy performance, based on an integrated and systemic strategy; • in 2024, CNP UniCredit Vita carried out a maintenance and restructuring project to improve the energy efficiency of its two office buildings, obtaining LEED Gold certification in December; • CNP Luxembourg has launched a project to relocate in 2025 to a building that meets the latest ESG criteria. The move will radically reduce the company’s carbon footprint compared with the two old buildings that it currently leases; • towards the end of 2023, CNP Santander relocated to a building with a high energy performance; • in Brazil, Caixa Vida e Previdência improved its energy efficiency management in 2024 by adopting measures such as the use of exclusively-LED light bulbs, lighting automation systems with luminosity sensors, and efficient air conditioning equipment. Its buildings in São Paulo and Barueri are LEED® Gold and Platinum-certified, respectively, and are in the process of obtaining LEED Interior Design and Construction (ID+C) certification; • Youse operates from a building with two LEED certifications: Gold for maintenance and operation and Silver for construction; • CNP Seguradora’s Barueri offices are in a LEED Gold- certified building, while its Berrini office building has LEED Platinum certification and obtains all of its energy from the free energy market. Promoting energy sufficiency and digital technologies CNP Assurances has adopted an energy-efficiency policy that focuses on improving the operation of heating, air-conditioning and ventilation systems through expert management of programmable time settings. Since 2022, it has applied a policy of setting heating to a maximum of 19°C and switching off neon signs at night. The Group has joined the EcoWatt responsible energy consumption initiative and is committed to reducing its consumption in periods of peak energy demand. IT processing centres and workstations are two key features of the digital transformation, and it is vital that the Group remains vigilant about their energy consumption. A pilot project is also under way to cut down on the energy used for ICT and data infrastructure. Employee awareness-raising and training CNP Assurances has set up a ""Green Actions"" programme to raise employee awareness about the need to reduce its environmental footprint. A Group charter has been sent out to all employees, inviting them to respect ecological principles such as sorting waste, reducing digital pollution and being energy efficient. In 2021, sustainable finance training was offered to 2,487 employees, covering 75% of the workforce. In 2023, 86% of the Group's employees followed an e-learning course on the ecological crisis, developed in partnership with well-known specialist networks. ""Climate Fresk” workshops have also been organised to help give employees a better understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change. Investing activities Sector exclusion policy CNP Assurances excludes from their investments companies linked to climate change impacts, such as those in the conventional or non-conventional coal, oil and fossil gas sectors. These policies are set out in the Climate Transition Plan. Shareholder engagement policy At the general meetings of listed companies in the portfolio, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries defend the interests of their policyholders and put their ESG commitments into practice by making their support for Say-on-Climate resolutions dependent on strict and clearly-defined criteria. They also engage in dialogue with investee companies and asset managers, face-to-face or by letter, to encourage them to reduce their impact on climate change while protecting their employees from the effects of the transition."
"88 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information In 2024, CNP Assurances voted at 84 General Meetings of 82 companies in 11 countries. These companies account for 100% of CNP Assurances’ directly held equity portfolio. It voted on 1,717 resolutions, approving 74.6% and opposing 25.3% of them. The negative votes predominantly concerned excessive remuneration for certain senior executives. A breakdown by topic of the votes cast by CNP Assurances is available in the report on its shareholder engagement policy on the cnp.fr website. In 2024, CNP Assurances continued its bilateral dialogues (16 direct dialogues and two dialogues carried out at its request by Ostrum AM) on governance, climate and biodiversity challenges. Engagement is organised with companies in which CNP Assurances is a shareholder or bondholder, as well as with asset management companies. In 2024, 41% of GHG emissions from direct holdings (equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure) were covered by the shareholder engagement work carried out by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries with the management of the companies concerned (bilateral dialogue or letters requesting a halt to new fossil fuel exploration and production projects). ESG-based investment selection CNP Assurances believes that including ESG criteria in investment decision processes contributes to value creation and enhances the risk-return ratio over time. Since 2006, it has implemented a strategy of ESG integration across all asset classes. Details of how ESG criteria are taken into account for each asset class are set out in the transition plan. Green investments Massive investments are needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. These investments contribute to the energy transition and also help CNP Assurances to manage its transition risk. CNP Assurances is committed to increasing its green investment portfolio – green bonds, forests, environment-labelled buildings, green infrastructure such as renewable energy projects and low- carbon transport and mobility projects – to €30 billion by the end of 2025, from €10.4 billion in 2018. As of end-2024, the Group's green investments totalled €29.4 billion. Investments in forests In the forests owned by CNP Assurances, the fight against climate change is based on the natural sequestration of CO2 by trees through photosynthesis.

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns. Today, they use biomass in the form of acai seeds and sawdust, which used to be major sources of waste in the region. In addition to reducing GHG emissions and easing pressure on the Amazon forest, the project supports the local economy by creating jobs and new markets for local biomass suppliers. The project also creates environmental activities to reduce the impact of the ceramics industry and supports vulnerable groups through several social initiatives. The purchase of carbon credits is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. the following external projects • the Nature Impact fund, an initiative launched by WWF France aimed at financing projects designed to preserve, restore and sustainably manage forests with high biodiversity value in mainland France. The underlying purpose of this fund is to protect 15,000 hectares of woodland in France – the equivalent of a quarter of the woodland that has been placed under “strong protection” by France’s National Forestry Office – while enabling the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over a period of 30 years. This fund is also being financed by La Banque Postale's carbon and biodiversity fund. CNP Assurances does not use the Nature Impact Fund to offset any of its GHG emissions, • in Brazil, in 2024, Caixa Vida e Previdência did not renew the voluntary financing of two projects initiated in 2023, but plans to do so again in 2025. The first of these projects – which is the outcome of a partnership between the Association of Extractive Reserve Residents (ASMOREX) and Biofílica Ambipar – is located in the Rio Preto-Jacundá extractive reserve and is aimed at reducing emissions by preserving forests, and promoting community development, education and healthcare. The second project, located in the town of Parnaíba, contributes to the production of wind power, • also in Brazil, CNP Seguranda set up a project called Conexão Amazônia in partnership with the Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (Idesam), investing R$2.5 million. Through this investment, CNP Seguradora is supporting local non- profits to promote entrepreneurship and create income streams from socio-environmentally responsible value chains such as vegetable oil production, handicrafts and furniture-making. The project helps to support around 500 families facing social problems, improving their quality of life while promoting environmental conservation. CNP Seguradora's support will also enable more than 5,000 trees to be planted to restore deforested areas in the region. The partnership with Idesam was signed in March 2024, during the Brazil-France Economic Forum on The Transition to the Green Economy."

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns. Today, they use biomass in the form of acai seeds and sawdust, which used to be major sources of waste in the region. In addition to reducing GHG emissions and easing pressure on the Amazon forest, the project supports the local economy by creating jobs and new markets for local biomass suppliers. The project also creates environmental activities to reduce the impact of the ceramics industry and supports vulnerable groups through several social initiatives. The purchase of carbon credits is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. the following external projects • the Nature Impact fund, an initiative launched by WWF France aimed at financing projects designed to preserve, restore and sustainably manage forests with high biodiversity value in mainland France. The underlying purpose of this fund is to protect 15,000 hectares of woodland in France – the equivalent of a quarter of the woodland that has been placed under “strong protection” by France’s National Forestry Office – while enabling the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over a period of 30 years. This fund is also being financed by La Banque Postale's carbon and biodiversity fund. CNP Assurances does not use the Nature Impact Fund to offset any of its GHG emissions, • in Brazil, in 2024, Caixa Vida e Previdência did not renew the voluntary financing of two projects initiated in 2023, but plans to do so again in 2025. The first of these projects – which is the outcome of a partnership between the Association of Extractive Reserve Residents (ASMOREX) and Biofílica Ambipar – is located in the Rio Preto-Jacundá extractive reserve and is aimed at reducing emissions by preserving forests, and promoting community development, education and healthcare. The second project, located in the town of Parnaíba, contributes to the production of wind power, • also in Brazil, CNP Seguranda set up a project called Conexão Amazônia in partnership with the Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (Idesam), investing R$2.5 million. Through this investment, CNP Seguradora is supporting local non- profits to promote entrepreneurship and create income streams from socio-environmentally responsible value chains such as vegetable oil production, handicrafts and furniture-making. The project helps to support around 500 families facing social problems, improving their quality of life while promoting environmental conservation. CNP Seguradora's support will also enable more than 5,000 trees to be planted to restore deforested areas in the region. The partnership with Idesam was signed in March 2024, during the Brazil-France Economic Forum on The Transition to the Green Economy."

The purpose of the initiative is to encourage the development of effective methodologies to take biodiversity into account in financial management practices. The aim is to contribute to meeting international objectives for the protection and restoration of biodiversity and to help all institutional investors fulfil their investment objectives in favour of nature and ecosystems. This will be achieved through new investment portfolio monitoring indicators and through the financing of companies that are contributing to the emergence of effective biodiversity solutions or transitioning towards a sustainable business model from a biodiversity standpoint. The initiative is also supported by Association Française de Gestion d’Actifs, Institut de la Finance Durable and France Assureurs. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries have chosen to invest in the unlisted fund, which will be deployed in 2025. Monitoring and reporting Various monitoring and reporting systems have been set up covering the application of shareholder engagement and exclusion policies and the selection of investments on the basis of ESG criteria. The companies that manage the portfolios of equities and bonds, the property portfolios and the forestry assets on behalf of CNP Assurances, prepare regular reports on their management of these assets for submission to CNP Assurances. For example, Ostrum AM presents its consolidated ESG rating to CNP Assurances at the quarterly meetings of the SRI Committee. CNP Assurances ensures that the ESG approach is properly applied in the management of buildings and works, through six- monthly reviews of renovation, certification and labelling activities. The sustainable forest management charter included in the management agreement between CNP Assurances and Société Forestière de la Caisse des Dépôts provides for the annual reporting of qualitative and quantitative indicators, including updates on progress towards the objectives set for the protection of biodiversity, water, soil and people. 2.2.5.4 Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems (E4‐3) Actions and resources relating to sustainable finance are detailed in section 2.2.1.3 “Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3)”. CNP Assurances focuses on initiatives aimed at reducing the environmental footprint and preserving biodiversity. However it does not yet invest in nature-based solutions (NbS), which, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are actions to address societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management and restoration of ecosystems, benefiting both human well- being and biodiversity. In practical terms, this can correspond to actions such as restoring forests, mangroves and coastal ecosystems to mitigate the effects of global warming. Similarly, it has not yet integrated local and indigenous knowledge into its biodiversity-related actions, other than for directly managed real estate and forestry assets, for which it works with local organisations. 2.2.5.5 Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems (E4‐4) Following the impact and dependency measurements carried out since 2022, a review will be undertaken to gradually establish quantified impact reduction targets. However, this will require improvements in both the accuracy of the measurements taken and the methodologies used for setting targets, as well as access to high-quality data. In 2021, CNP Assurances signed the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge – a commitment that requires it to: • cooperate and share knowledge about biodiversity-related measurement and target-setting methodologies; • integrate biodiversity in the responsible investment policy and shareholder engagement policy; • assess the positive and negative impacts of investments on biodiversity; • publish science-based targets to increase positive and reduce negative impacts on biodiversity; • report annually on the investment portfolios’ performance in relation to these objectives."

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns. Today, they use biomass in the form of acai seeds and sawdust, which used to be major sources of waste in the region. In addition to reducing GHG emissions and easing pressure on the Amazon forest, the project supports the local economy by creating jobs and new markets for local biomass suppliers. The project also creates environmental activities to reduce the impact of the ceramics industry and supports vulnerable groups through several social initiatives. The purchase of carbon credits is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. the following external projects • the Nature Impact fund, an initiative launched by WWF France aimed at financing projects designed to preserve, restore and sustainably manage forests with high biodiversity value in mainland France. The underlying purpose of this fund is to protect 15,000 hectares of woodland in France – the equivalent of a quarter of the woodland that has been placed under “strong protection” by France’s National Forestry Office – while enabling the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over a period of 30 years. This fund is also being financed by La Banque Postale's carbon and biodiversity fund. CNP Assurances does not use the Nature Impact Fund to offset any of its GHG emissions, • in Brazil, in 2024, Caixa Vida e Previdência did not renew the voluntary financing of two projects initiated in 2023, but plans to do so again in 2025. The first of these projects – which is the outcome of a partnership between the Association of Extractive Reserve Residents (ASMOREX) and Biofílica Ambipar – is located in the Rio Preto-Jacundá extractive reserve and is aimed at reducing emissions by preserving forests, and promoting community development, education and healthcare. The second project, located in the town of Parnaíba, contributes to the production of wind power, • also in Brazil, CNP Seguranda set up a project called Conexão Amazônia in partnership with the Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (Idesam), investing R$2.5 million. Through this investment, CNP Seguradora is supporting local non- profits to promote entrepreneurship and create income streams from socio-environmentally responsible value chains such as vegetable oil production, handicrafts and furniture-making. The project helps to support around 500 families facing social problems, improving their quality of life while promoting environmental conservation. CNP Seguradora's support will also enable more than 5,000 trees to be planted to restore deforested areas in the region. The partnership with Idesam was signed in March 2024, during the Brazil-France Economic Forum on The Transition to the Green Economy."

In particular, CNP Assurances considers that its investments could have a negative impact that could result in: • damage to ecosystems and public health [IRO 1]; • depletion of resources [IRO 1]; • biodiversity loss [IRO 1]. Reducing these negative impacts requires a responsible investment strategy. The general responsible investing approach applied by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries(1) is tailored to the specific nature of each asset class. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ approach is based on the principles of the Responsible Investment Charter and guided by the Global Compact principles, including protecting the environment. This approach contributes to seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Policies and actions relating to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) are based on the pillars of CNP Assurances’ responsible investment strategy: • exclusion policy (1); • non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets (2); • shareholder engagement policy (3). The responsible investment strategy is defined as part of the investment strategy approved by Executive Management and the Board of Directors. A dedicated responsible investment governance structure has been set up to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Management, the relevant committees and the investment teams to integrate ESG issues into their decision-making and operational processes. The governance framework in place to implement and track these policies is described in section 2.1.2.1 entitled “Role of administrative, management and supervisory bodies (GOV-1)”. The stakeholders consulted are detailed in section 2.1.3.2 “Interests and views of stakeholders (SBM‐2)”. The resources allocated to sustainable finance within CNP Assurances are detailed in section 2.2.1.1 “Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1).” 2.2.2.1 Exclusion policy CNP Assurances excludes certain countries and companies from their investments on the basis of ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. In particular, some companies are excluded because they are involved in activities that may have a negative impact on the environment. The specific exclusion criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2‐2), water and marine resources (E3-2), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4-3) and resource use and circular economy (E5‐2) – are described in the sections below about the actions and resources related to each matter.

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 93 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.2.2 Non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets ESG filters for listed equities and bonds For directly-held equities and corporate bonds, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries use a best-in- class approach for their investment selection, applying the ESG filters used for the GREaT(1) non-financial analysis methodology. Corporate issuers’ non-financial ratings are calculated using this method, which makes it possible to carry out pragmatic and differentiating analyses of companies with regard to sustainable development challenges, and taking into account negative impacts. The “GREaT” methodology measures commitment and responsibility across four pillars, including sustainable management of environmental and human resources. This pillar assesses the sustainable management of human and natural resources, minimises the company’s negative impact on its ecosystem, and promotes companies that nurture their human capital. The specific criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) – are described in their corresponding sections. The Green Works property management charter Real estate has a significant impact on the environment, both in the construction and operating phases. The Green Works Charter sets rules that must be followed by the companies that manage the portfolios of real estate directly held by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries in order to limit pollution, reduce water consumption, track the use of resources and promote the circular economy. The ESG criteria are defined in operational terms in the property management mandate. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ real estate asset management companies undertake to carry out works in accordance with the rules of this charter, particularly in relation to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5). The specific criteria for each matter are described in their corresponding sections. CNP Assurances’ real estate asset management companies are responsible for the risks associated with this charter. CNP Assurances expects them to manage these risks in a balanced and appropriate manner on a case-by-case basis, depending on the materiality of the matter in question. The policy of selecting investments on the basis of ESG criteria is also used for other asset classes. This policy is detailed in the Climate Transition Plan. 2.2.2.3 Shareholder engagement and voting policy At the general meetings of listed companies in the portfolio, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries defend the interests of their policyholders and put their ESG commitments into practice. They also engage in dialogue with investee companies and asset managers, face-to-face or by letter, to encourage them to reduce their negative impacts. CNP Assurances applies its voting policy pragmatically, in some cases taking into account the specific characteristics of each company, such as business sector, national regulations, main ESG risks, size, shareholder structure, and economic and financial circumstances. CNP Assurances does not have specific targets for ESRS E2, E3 (including water and sustainable oceans and seas) and E5. The specific targets related to ESRS E4 are described in the ESRS E4 section on biodiversity and ecosystems.

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns.

Scope: CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries Impact materiality is assessed based on the criteria of scale, scope, irremediable character, likelihood and long-term impact. Positive or negative impacts assessed as material will differ from one another in that they may have more or less serious impacts, be more or less far-reaching, be reversible or non- reversible, be actual or potential and have a more or less significant long-term impact. Materiality is assessed on a gross basis, i.e., without taking into account prevention, mitigation or remedial measures. The procedure for identifying and assessing impacts, risks and opportunities is described in section 2.1.4.1 “Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)”."
"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns. Today, they use biomass in the form of acai seeds and sawdust, which used to be major sources of waste in the region. In addition to reducing GHG emissions and easing pressure on the Amazon forest, the project supports the local economy by creating jobs and new markets for local biomass suppliers. The project also creates environmental activities to reduce the impact of the ceramics industry and supports vulnerable groups through several social initiatives. The purchase of carbon credits is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. the following external projects • the Nature Impact fund, an initiative launched by WWF France aimed at financing projects designed to preserve, restore and sustainably manage forests with high biodiversity value in mainland France. The underlying purpose of this fund is to protect 15,000 hectares of woodland in France – the equivalent of a quarter of the woodland that has been placed under “strong protection” by France’s National Forestry Office – while enabling the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over a period of 30 years. This fund is also being financed by La Banque Postale's carbon and biodiversity fund. CNP Assurances does not use the Nature Impact Fund to offset any of its GHG emissions, • in Brazil, in 2024, Caixa Vida e Previdência did not renew the voluntary financing of two projects initiated in 2023, but plans to do so again in 2025. The first of these projects – which is the outcome of a partnership between the Association of Extractive Reserve Residents (ASMOREX) and Biofílica Ambipar – is located in the Rio Preto-Jacundá extractive reserve and is aimed at reducing emissions by preserving forests, and promoting community development, education and healthcare. The second project, located in the town of Parnaíba, contributes to the production of wind power, • also in Brazil, CNP Seguranda set up a project called Conexão Amazônia in partnership with the Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (Idesam), investing R$2.5 million. Through this investment, CNP Seguradora is supporting local non- profits to promote entrepreneurship and create income streams from socio-environmentally responsible value chains such as vegetable oil production, handicrafts and furniture-making. The project helps to support around 500 families facing social problems, improving their quality of life while promoting environmental conservation. CNP Seguradora's support will also enable more than 5,000 trees to be planted to restore deforested areas in the region. The partnership with Idesam was signed in March 2024, during the Brazil-France Economic Forum on The Transition to the Green Economy."

In particular, CNP Assurances considers that its investments could have a negative impact that could result in: • damage to ecosystems and public health [IRO 1]; • depletion of resources [IRO 1]; • biodiversity loss [IRO 1]. Reducing these negative impacts requires a responsible investment strategy. The general responsible investing approach applied by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries(1) is tailored to the specific nature of each asset class. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ approach is based on the principles of the Responsible Investment Charter and guided by the Global Compact principles, including protecting the environment. This approach contributes to seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Policies and actions relating to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) are based on the pillars of CNP Assurances’ responsible investment strategy: • exclusion policy (1); • non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets (2); • shareholder engagement policy (3). The responsible investment strategy is defined as part of the investment strategy approved by Executive Management and the Board of Directors. A dedicated responsible investment governance structure has been set up to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Management, the relevant committees and the investment teams to integrate ESG issues into their decision-making and operational processes. The governance framework in place to implement and track these policies is described in section 2.1.2.1 entitled “Role of administrative, management and supervisory bodies (GOV-1)”. The stakeholders consulted are detailed in section 2.1.3.2 “Interests and views of stakeholders (SBM‐2)”. The resources allocated to sustainable finance within CNP Assurances are detailed in section 2.2.1.1 “Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1).” 2.2.2.1 Exclusion policy CNP Assurances excludes certain countries and companies from their investments on the basis of ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. In particular, some companies are excluded because they are involved in activities that may have a negative impact on the environment. The specific exclusion criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2‐2), water and marine resources (E3-2), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4-3) and resource use and circular economy (E5‐2) – are described in the sections below about the actions and resources related to each matter.

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 93 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.2.2 Non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets ESG filters for listed equities and bonds For directly-held equities and corporate bonds, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries use a best-in- class approach for their investment selection, applying the ESG filters used for the GREaT(1) non-financial analysis methodology. Corporate issuers’ non-financial ratings are calculated using this method, which makes it possible to carry out pragmatic and differentiating analyses of companies with regard to sustainable development challenges, and taking into account negative impacts. The “GREaT” methodology measures commitment and responsibility across four pillars, including sustainable management of environmental and human resources. This pillar assesses the sustainable management of human and natural resources, minimises the company’s negative impact on its ecosystem, and promotes companies that nurture their human capital. The specific criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) – are described in their corresponding sections. The Green Works property management charter Real estate has a significant impact on the environment, both in the construction and operating phases. The Green Works Charter sets rules that must be followed by the companies that manage the portfolios of real estate directly held by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries in order to limit pollution, reduce water consumption, track the use of resources and promote the circular economy. The ESG criteria are defined in operational terms in the property management mandate. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ real estate asset management companies undertake to carry out works in accordance with the rules of this charter, particularly in relation to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5). The specific criteria for each matter are described in their corresponding sections. CNP Assurances’ real estate asset management companies are responsible for the risks associated with this charter. CNP Assurances expects them to manage these risks in a balanced and appropriate manner on a case-by-case basis, depending on the materiality of the matter in question. The policy of selecting investments on the basis of ESG criteria is also used for other asset classes. This policy is detailed in the Climate Transition Plan. 2.2.2.3 Shareholder engagement and voting policy At the general meetings of listed companies in the portfolio, CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries defend the interests of their policyholders and put their ESG commitments into practice. They also engage in dialogue with investee companies and asset managers, face-to-face or by letter, to encourage them to reduce their negative impacts. CNP Assurances applies its voting policy pragmatically, in some cases taking into account the specific characteristics of each company, such as business sector, national regulations, main ESG risks, size, shareholder structure, and economic and financial circumstances. CNP Assurances does not have specific targets for ESRS E2, E3 (including water and sustainable oceans and seas) and E5. The specific targets related to ESRS E4 are described in the ESRS E4 section on biodiversity and ecosystems.
