"Pollution 307 METRICS: POLLUTION Air and water pollution Metrics on emissions into air and water The metrics recorded across the Group are shown in the following. If thresholds for other air or water emissions as defined by the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR) are exceeded at European produc- tion sites, the sites report this to the competent authorities as part of their annual reporting obligations.

The information for 2023 is provided voluntarily and has not been externally validated. Description of measurement methodologies Group standard 98000 defines indicators for emissions to enable their consistent collection at Volkswagen Group sites. They include the recording of pollutants discharged into wastewater such as zinc, nickel, COD, total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved fluoride as well as air emissions such as dust, VOCs, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), CFCs and HFCs. The recording hierarchy in accordance with Group standard 98000 applies in conjunction with the permitted measurement methods described in the standard. These are parameter- specific and based on the state of the art. Context information on pollution of air The Volkswagen Group’s production sites record a range of environmentally relevant air emissions, irrespective of national legislation or regulatory requirements. These include refrigerants containing climate-relevant CFCs or HFCs, for which the quantities emitted from stationary facilities are recorded. Emissions from combustion processes, such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide, are calculated by multiplying the quantities of fuel used by country-specific emission factors, unless more precise, site-specific emission factors are available. In addition, the VOC emissions, which are mainly released during painting processes, are recorded. When calculating VOC emissions, as a minimum those emissions required by national legislation or plant permits are recorded. VOC emissions from painting facilities must be calculated for all vehicle paint shops. If VOC emis- sions are combusted through thermal post-combustion or regenerative post-combustion, the CO2 emissions released must also be recorded. With regard to recording particulate matter with a diameter of 10 μm or less (particulate matter 10 – PM10), it is permitted to record the total dust quantity and then convert it into PM10 using conversion factors.
