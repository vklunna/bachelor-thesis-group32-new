Analysis of alternatives to single-use products to be carried out in the various businesses. Supplier selection to include and develop criteria regarding product packaging, based on the CSR criteria matrix rolled out for buyers in 2024. Preferring composting over methanisation of biowaste Potential additional costs Selection of biowaste collection service providers on the basis of the waste treatment methods applied. Potential additional costs would arise from the introduction of biowaste collection for facilities/ countries that do not yet have this system and from a change in treatment method if the current system involves methanisation. Redirecting some residual waste for composting No Continue to raise awareness and monitor waste reduction and sorting practices in facilities. Initiatives to be carried out in terms of the development of new waste channels. 3-6 Business travel Business travel Reducing business travel No Adapt travel policies to reduce the volume of business travel and ensure the use of low-carbon modes of transport wherever possible. 3-7 Commuting Commuting Encouraging the use of public transport Potential additional costs Generalise incentives to use public transport (such as partial reimbursement by the employer, as adopted in France, although this could generate potential additional costs). Develop initiatives to reduce the distance between home and work wherever possible. Encouraging car pooling No Development of offers and partnerships and acting as a liaison point in order to encourage employees to adopt car pooling using their personal or company vehicles to get to work. The environmental taxonomy framework does not allow the Group to assess all mitigation actions carried out and referred to in ESRS E1. This is because the Group’s core business is caring for those in need and most of its revenue is earned in exchange for personal services, care and medical treatment provided to people in vulnerable situations. Clariane primarily has a social purpose, and this can only be assessed under the social taxonomy, which has not yet been drawn up by the European authorities. To date, only the environmental taxonomy has been codified (EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852). Work to define a social taxonomy is still ongoing, and no timetable has been set as yet. As a result, the Group has not set a target for aligning its turnover (revenue), OpEx and CapEx with the environmental taxonomy. This is due to the fact that: • the text of the environmental taxonomy only allows for the recognition of revenue from property rentals and sales under Activity 12.1 “Residential care activities” related to the climate change adaptation objective. Accordingly, revenue from caring for residents and patients, the Group’s core business, is excluded; • the materiality exemption is applied to OpEx that meet the taxonomy definition as they are not material; • for the 2024 taxonomy reporting, only CapEx over the €0.8 million threshold was analysed, making it impossible to obtain an accurate picture of all eligible CapEx. The Group expects its CapEx alignment to increase going forward, in line with the internal work carried out on the granularity of analysis by type of CapEx, enabling in particular CapEx contributing to decarbonisation to be monitored and individual measures to be assessed from 2025 onwards. Work in progress on centralising data relating to the Group’s real estate portfolio – and in particular building specifications – will also facilitate alignment analysis. 2024 Universal Registration Document — Clariane 122 Sustainability Statement and Duty of Care Plan Disclosures relating to environmental matters 3"
