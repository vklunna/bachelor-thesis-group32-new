Material IROs and their interaction with strategy and business model — resilience analysis and climate scenario planning The resilience analysis conducted in June 2022 and updated in 2024 is based on our climate scenario planning, covering both direct and indirect emissions from our own operations (scope 1 and 2) and indirect emissions along the upstream and downstream value chain (scope 3). Risks that met the financial materiality thresholds as a result of the resilience analysis were further embedded into our risk management process. Our full value chain has been included in this analysis: upstream, including design, raw material production, manufacturing processes; own operations, including procurement and buying plus fulfilment; downstream, including transport, product use and end-of-life. The analysis considers material physical risks, including hazards related to temperature, water, wind and soil. Additionally, potential policy and legal developments, technology shifts, market changes and reputational events were assessed to evaluate our exposure to transition risks. For more information, please refer to Impacts, risks and opportunities in section 2.8.1 General information. We assessed the climate resilience of our business by looking at climate-related transition and physical risks and opportunities in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The analysis took into account factors such as the availability of new technologies, regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, customer expectations and the broader business environment, including competitor actions. We used two different global GHG emissions pathways for the scenario analysis. In particular, we considered the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) AR5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 scenario, which assumes an increase in global temperatures to 1.5°C, and the AR5 IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario, with an increase of 4°C. The scenarios consider temperature, precipitation and the number of hot days. These scenarios were adapted to local conditions, and potential impacts on retail companies were assessed across three time frames: by 2025 (short-term), by 2030 (medium-term) and by 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 201 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"2050 (long-term). Parameters including increases in average monthly temperatures, precipitation levels and the number of extreme heat days (above 35°C) were analysed, and findings for Germany were confirmed using World Bank modelling tools. The climate scenario analysis conducted in 2022 enhanced our strategic planning by identifying climate-related risks and opportunities, and highlighting necessary investments for a science-based net-zero ambition through a cross-functional evaluation of potential business impacts. Physical risks include disruptions to sales and forecasting due to shifting weather patterns, extreme weather events impacting revenue, supply chain disruptions from raw material shortages, operational risks at logistic centres and stores and logistics delays due to severe weather. Transition risks are linked to the energy market volatility leading to renewable energy scarcity and increased operational costs from rising energy prices, which could also lead to reputational risks from potentially missing emission reduction targets and following changes of customer preferences. Although uncertainties remain — particularly in financial, reputational and strategic analyses — due to the qualitative assessment of the likelihood and magnitude of the potential impacts, we remain confident in our ability to adapt through strategic investments by setting SBTs aligned with our net-zero ambition for emissions reduction and enhancing logistics with the integration of renewable energy. We plan to update the climate scenarios analysis in 2025 to reflect new data and trends. For more information on our targets and ambition on climate change, please refer to the section below Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our business activities, including production, distribution, transportation and sale of goods, are major contributors to our carbon footprint. Our 2024–2028 corporate strategy (please refer to section 2.1.3 Group strategy of the combined management report) showcases our ability to adapt to climate-related risks and opportunities. A key component of this strategy is the introduction of the new B2B business model, ZEOS Fulfilment, which maximises the use of our existing logistics services. Through ZEOS Fulfilment, we aim to create an operating system for fashion and lifestyle in Europe, enabling brands and retailers to manage their multi-channel businesses within one unified platform across the continent via Zalando. We have been doing this by first opening up access to our expansive and well-invested logistics, software and services infrastructure. ZEOS Fulfilment aims to reduce industry overstock, shorten parcel delivery distances and aggregate customer orders placed across multiple platforms. This shift reflects our increasing focus on offering services, thus contributing to long-term efficiency and enhanced carbon management. For more details on our strategy, please refer to the Strategy section of 2.8.1 General information; for more details on specific activities and emissions coverage, please refer to Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation and Gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions sections below. Identification and assessment of material climate-related IROs Our business operations are linked to emissions being released into the atmosphere through our value chain. To understand what drives the most impact, we calculate our GHG emissions footprint on a yearly basis following the GHG Protocol (GHGP) as the accounting standard of reference. By following the GHGP, we ensure all our activities are screened and included in 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 202 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"the estimations of our impact on climate change. For more information on the screened activities, please refer to Gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions section below. In order to identify and assess the physical risks we may be exposed to, we took into consideration the results of the climate resilience analysis performed in 2022, and the annual climate-related risk assessments embedded in our risk process. Physical risks include: changing temperatures, heat waves, and extreme weather events like floods or drought, which can impact logistics operations and value chains, and can result in potential financial loss. Our Governance and Risk team biannually identifies, assesses and reports climate-related risks through workshops, self-assessments and ad-hoc reporting. The process involves close collaboration with the SDI team. As detailed in the resilience analysis section above, we adopted the TCFD recommendations to conduct an initial assessment of our exposure to climate change. This assessment considered longer time horizons and was performed in 2022 to better understand the potential risks and opportunities associated with climate change. We do not explicitly link short-, medium- and long-term time horizons to the expected lifetime of our assets, as our operations primarily involve retailing with limited tangible assets. Our strategic planning is focused on short-term cycles, typically spanning four years. However, we recognise the long-term implications of climate change. In assessing the extent to which our business activities may be exposed and are sensitive to the identified climate-related hazards, we took into consideration the likelihood and magnitude of impacts. We did not use geospatial coordinates nor the full magnitude and duration of the hazards. In order to identify and assess the transition risks and opportunities for our business, we considered the results of the climate resilience analysis performed in 2022 alongside factors such as the availability of new technologies, regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, customer expectations and the broader business environment, including competitor actions. In our assessment of the extent to which our assets and business activities may be exposed and are sensitive to the identified climate-related transition events, we considered the likelihood and magnitude of impacts. The 1.5°C climate scenario analysed in 2022 supported us to assess the compatibility of our business model with a climate-neutral economy. We have not identified any assets or business activities that are inherently incompatible with a climate- neutral economy. The climate scenarios analysed considered both transition and physical risks. We have limited high-emissions assets, considering that transportation and manufacturing processes with higher locked-in GHG emissions are primarily outside our direct operations. While no incompatible activities nor assets were found, significant efforts are being focused on our net-zero ambition to ensure business alignment with a climate-neutral economy. Progressing towards our net-zero ambition will involve improving energy efficiency and increasing the uptake of renewable energy in our operations and value chain, increasing the share of lower carbon materials, and driving business efficiencies while scaling circular business models. 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 203 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"

"ESRS E2 Pollution Identification and assessment of material pollution-related IROs We have identified five significant environmental impacts and associated human health concerns related to pollution. These impacts are as follows: — Water pollution: arising from the material processing phase, particularly during dyeing, and involving the use of water and chemicals. — Microplastic release: synthetic fibres contribute to the release of microplastics during washing cycles, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health. — Air pollution: caused by fragmented value chains that depend on long-distance transportation, leading to increased emissions. — Soil pollution: resulting from the use of pesticides and fertilisers in the conventional farming of natural fibres, which contaminate both soil and water sources. — Chemical pollution: processes such as bleaching, printing and finishing often involve harmful chemicals that, if not properly managed, can be released into the environment. The material environmental impacts resulting from the DMA occur during the production and distribution stages, including raw material extraction, textile production and transportation. These stages are outside our direct operations. Within our own operations, emissions are comparatively non-significant. For example, non-carbon emissions to air of our fulfilment centres are significantly lower than the emissions generated by the manufacturing processes. Similarly, microplastics potentially generated from our operations, if present, are minimal compared to the microplastics generated during the use phase of a fashion product over its life span. We did not screen site locations for pollution-related IROs, as none of the sites under our operation and control have emission sources that require reporting according to Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, E-PRTR Regulation). Affected communities along the value chain were not directly consulted during the DMA. For further information on stakeholder engagement in our DMA, please refer to Impacts, risks and opportunities in section 2.8.1 General information. For these reasons, our disclosures on pollution focus on our policies and actions related to chemical management. Accordingly, we have not yet established any group-wide policies, actions or targets in relation to pollution of air, water, soil and microplastics in line with the ESRS. Reporting on pollution metrics (disclosure requirements ESRS E2-4 and E2-5) for our own operations is not included as it is considered not material to Zalando according to our DMA. Policies related to pollution To manage upstream and downstream impacts and comply with regulations, we have developed a chemical management system. This includes the Restricted Substances List (RSL) to determine chemical requirements and limits for harmful substances in products. For private labels, the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) restricts chemicals in production, aligned with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals standards.

ESRS E3 Water resources Identification and assessment of material water-related IROs Our business depends on continued access to water, and we are already witnessing the effects of water scarcity and water quality risks in our activities. Previously assessed climate- related risks and opportunities described in the Resilience analysis and climate scenario planning in section ESRS E1 Climate change have informed our DMA. Our climate resilience analysis contributes to identifying water-related risks linked to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, such as flooding or droughts, along our value chain and in our own operations. Key risks carried into our DMA include reputational risks from water consumption in our value chain, business continuity risks from water scarcity affecting raw material availability and human health impacts from reduced water security. Opportunities centre on the potential to enable collective action on water stewardship. No IROs related to marine resources were identified as our business does not rely on marine resources. We have not screened our assets and activities to identify the IROs. However, in 2024 we undertook an assessment of water risk areas related to our own operations. This assessment specifically focuses on our direct impact on water consumption in these water risk regions, with further details provided in the following section. In 2024, we conducted a water risk assessment for our private labels for major Tier 2 (wet processing) facilities, and going forward we aim to pay particular attention to our private labels’ water impact, particularly in high water stress areas. Direct consultations with affected communities have not been conducted. Policies related to water We established our water management policy in 2024, reflecting our ambition to addressing the critical water challenges associated with our own operations and value chain. This policy sets the foundation for managing water consumption and pollution and for managing water- related risks. We are dedicated to continuously expanding and refining our water management approach in the future in alignment with industry best practices and stakeholder expectations. Water management is critical for the resilience of our business operations and value chain. The aim of our water management policy is to minimise our water consumption and water pollution, comply with regulatory requirements and ensure the responsible use of water resources across our own operations and value chain. 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 218 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"Our water stewardship guiding objectives and management principles are: — Pursuing efficient water use: We are dedicated to measuring our water footprint and identifying opportunities to reduce water consumption — especially in areas of limited water availability and higher water stress — and enhancing water efficiency across our operations while promoting best practice for water use across our value chain. This could include adopting water-saving technologies, optimising processes to reduce water consumption and promoting responsible water use among employees. — Minimising water pollution: Our aim is to identify key sources of water pollution and opportunities to minimise it, including ensuring that wastewater is treated to meet or exceed environmental standards before discharge. — Complying with regulations: We will pursue compliance with water-related regulations and standards that apply to our business. This involves monitoring regulatory changes and implementing due diligence procedures, where relevant. — Managing water-related risks, impacts, dependencies and opportunities: We will regularly assess water-related risks and impacts pertaining to our own operations and value chain and develop strategies to manage and mitigate material issues. This assessment may also include identifying dependencies on water resources in alignment with leading guidance and frameworks. — Engaging stakeholders: We will engage with stakeholders to gain additional insight, build awareness, and collaborate on water-related initiatives to promote the minimisation of our water consumption and water pollution. — Enhancing product and service design: We will continue to integrate sustainable business practices, including water efficiency and water pollution prevention, into the design and classification of our products and services. This includes identifying materials and processes which require less water and which generate minimal wastewater. The scope of our water management policy in 2024 includes: — Water management and the identification of opportunities for reducing water consumption in our fulfilment centres and offices; — Minimisation of water use and improved water management, including pollution and water treatment for priority private labels’ value chain partners.

"Actions and resources related to water management Our key action is the factory improvement programme — the initiative to engage factories in our private labels’ value chain to address their carbon and water impacts. Participating factories develop and sign off on action plans to improve their water and energy management. For further information on the initiative please refer to Actions and resources related to climate change policies in section ESRS E1 Climate change. Targets related to water management We are currently in the exploratory phase and have not yet set specific water targets in line with the ESRS. We are considering water quality, quantity, and risk and stress levers. The monitoring of water consumption will be used to track the effectiveness of our water management policy related to water quantity (for our own operations). As the policy emphasises efficient water use, tracking consumption will allow us to measure progress towards our objectives. The year 2024 will act as the baseline for future evaluations, providing a reference point for our ongoing improvement efforts.

"Water consumption: For each Zalando logistics and non-logistics site, the values for water consumption are estimated based on the measured water withdrawal data from the water supply network: — For non-logistics facilities (e.g. office spaces, showrooms, retail spaces, etc.): Water consumption is estimated to be 10% of the water withdrawn from the water supply network. The estimation is based primarily on data from the literature and the range is adjusted to account for geography, nature of activities in these spaces — primarily non- intensive water use activities, where a high share of water withdrawn is returned to the sewer system. — For logistics facilities (e.g. fulfilment centres): Water consumption is estimated to be 10% of the water withdrawn from the water supply network. The estimation is based primarily on data from the literature and the range is adjusted to account for geography and the nature of activities in these spaces. Ultimately, our total water consumption is calculated as the sum of all water consumption (in m 3) at facilities in our own operations. Total water consumption in areas at water risk: To identify areas of high water risk, we employ a composite index approach that aggregates multiple water-related risks, i.e. physical risk quantity, physical risk quality, and regulatory and reputational risks, allowing for a comprehensive risk assessment. The calculation is performed on via the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool, which returns values for the total water risk on a scale from “0” (low risk) to “5” (extremely high risk). The assessment covered 63 logistics and non-logistics sites. Among all Zalando sites, only our fulfilment centre in Lodz, Poland is classified as in an area at high overall water risk. Water consumption in areas at water risk is calculated as the sum of all water consumption at facilities that are located in areas of high and extremely high overall water risk (scores from 3 to 5). Total water recycled and reused: The total water recycled and reused is the amount of water and wastewater (treated or untreated) that has been used more than once within Zalando before being discharged. — For non-logistics facilities (e.g. office spaces, showrooms, retail spaces, etc.): No water is recycled and reused. — For logistics facilities (e.g. fulfilment centres): No water is recycled and reused. Total water stored: The total water stored is the amount of water that is held in water storage facilities, and is calculated as the sum of all water volumes stored at facilities in our own operations. — For non-logistics facilities (e.g. office spaces, showrooms, retail spaces, etc.): The volume of water stored is reported equal to the storing capacity of the water tanks at each site. — For logistics facilities (e.g. fulfilment centres): The volume of water stored is reported equal to the storing capacity of the water tanks at each site. 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 221 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"Change in water stored: This represents the year-on-year difference in the volume of water stored at our logistics and non-logistics facilities. Since 2024 is the first year of measurement, the first available value will be reported in the 2025 financial year. Water intensity: The water intensity ratio is calculated by dividing the total water consumption for our own operations by the net revenue of Zalando. Our water intensity is 2.2 m 3/m EUR. This relatively low value for the water intensity metric reflects the limited water consumption in our direct operations. Within our own operations, we do not engage in water-intensive activities as our core processes, e.g. warehousing, office and showrooms, have a relatively low water usage. We acknowledge that our more significant water impacts lie within our upstream value chain, particularly in raw material extraction, product manufacturing, and downstream activities related to product use. ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Identification and assessment of material resource use and circular economy-related IROs To identify the environmental impact potential related to the circular economy, we conducted life cycle assessments (LCAs) in 2022 and updated them in 2024 during the DMA. They encompassed different circular business models such as pre-owned, take-back, care and repair, and reusable packaging. The LCA results highlighted that raw material extraction and processing were the most significant environmental impact areas of a product’s life cycle. These outcomes informed our DMA, completed in 2024, and our new circularity policy. Regarding the use of materials, we depend heavily on cotton, polyester and leather as key materials for the majority of products offered by our private label business and brand partners. By embedding more sustainable practices across our value chain — from product sourcing and design to logistics and recommerce — we ensure that we remain resilient in the face of emerging environmental challenges, while contributing to the creation of long-term value for our stakeholders. We have outlined the specific business units responsible for managing IROs related to our resource use and circular economy initiatives below. The SDI team includes resources dedicated to the oversight of the comprehensive assessment of IROs related to resource use and the circular economy. This team sets our strategic direction for transitioning to a circular economy by developing strategic initiatives and partnerships that accelerate circular innovation. Policies related to resource use and circular economy Our circularity policy provides an overarching strategic framework for driving progress in the circular economy to manage our material IROs. The policy focuses on three foundational pillars: i) Circular products, ii) Circular business models and iii) End-of-life, broadly covering our business activities. We are committed to fostering innovation by continuing our efforts to support and scale up initiatives, building on strategic investments in textile-to-textile recyclers to date. For further information on our approach to innovation, please refer to Entity-specific information: Innovation and partnerships in section 2.8.4 Governance information. 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 222 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"Circularity is a complementary component of our net-zero ambition which we aim to achieve through three primary decarbonisation levers: material substitution, energy and circular business models. Circularity plays an important role, particularly in material use and circular models, advancing our progress towards our net-zero ambition. Furthermore, circularity is embedded across other dimensions of our sustainability approach, including decent work and D&I. It is a component of our strategy in both the B2C and B2B vectors. For our customers, circularity enables a better shopping experience by empowering them to buy and wear more apparel with a reduced environmental impact and feel better informed about their fashion choices. In the B2B space, circular services enhance our role as an ecosystem partner for our brands. Our circularity policy closely considers the transition away from virgin resources, particularly within the circular products and end-of-life pillars. Increasing the use of recycled content, especially within our private labels, is a core part of our circular products pillar. We aim to scale the use of recycled content, focusing primarily on cotton, man-made cellulosics (MMCFs) and polyester. For the end-of-life pillar, we are currently exploring the landscape in detail to define the key areas in which we can support the industry. Our circularity policy scope covers both upstream and downstream activities, engaging a range of cross-functional internal as well as external stakeholders, including brand partners, suppliers and third parties. Dedicated resources within our SDI team are responsible for the design and content of the policy. The VP SDI is accountable for its effective implementation across the business. Our circularity policy was closely developed in collaboration with key external partners, notably the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF). As a partner of the EMF, we align our circularity strategy with its guiding principles. In addition to collaborating with external partners, our circularity policy was developed through active engagement with cross- functional teams across Zalando. This approach has ensured alignment on key areas of overlap and clearly defined roles between the SDI team and embedded teams within the various business models. In line with the direction set by the circularity policy, we have applied a set of minimum sustainability and circularity product requirements through the implementation of the sustainable sourcing policy. The policy informs and guides our private labels, suppliers, agents and trading companies (i.e. business partners) on minimum environmental and ethical practices to ensure that the products we procure and sell meet sustainability-related regulatory requirements and our own requirements. The policy aims to support the transition to a fair, sustainable and circular economy and defines a level of ambition brands should strive for, along with industry initiatives that could support their sustainability journey. We require all partners to comply with certain minimum requirements at the product level that go beyond legal requirements. If there is doubt that these requirements are being met, we can request supporting evidence to ensure that the minimum requirements at the product level are 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 223 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"being fulfilled. Products found to be non-compliant with the policy’s minimum requirements are off-boarded from the platform where necessary. In addition to the circularity and sustainable sourcing policies, Zalando’s logistic sites in our operating countries are responsible for implementing a waste management approach and, where applicable, coordinate this with logistic partners. Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy Single-use plastic reduction As part of our previous sustainability strategy, do.MORE, significant efforts were made to reduce the amount of single-use plastic packaging. Key initiatives included introducing paper- based alternatives in 2021 and transitioning from plastic mailing bags to paper shipping bags. The implementation of paper shipping bags began in January 2021, with the goal of replacing plastic shipping bags across the network. By the end of 2022, we had partially rolled out paper alternatives, increasing the paper bag share to 76.2%. 60 Additionally, in October 2022, we eliminated the use of void fill from the shipments going out from our fulfilment centres, excluding Lounge by Zalando. Before, boxes were filled with void fill (plastic matter) to transport the products in a stable and protected manner. In May 2023, we launched a new shipping bag specification and tender, which redesigned our entire packaging portfolio. This included the development of a comprehensive specification document that aimed to achieve a full rollout of paper shipping bags while eliminating plastic shipping bags. The transition was completed in March 2024, and the initiative has contributed to the significant reduction of single-use plastics across our portfolio. Contract adjustments In all contractual negotiations with our packaging suppliers, we have established the following mandatory actions: — LCA: Suppliers are required to support the execution of an LCA of the product(s) in accordance with the European Product Environmental Footprint methodology, in cooperation with us. — Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification: Suppliers must provide documented proof of FSC certification for any virgin forest fibres (100.0% or mixed). This proof must include the FSC Chain of Custody certification code and FSC licence code. — Mechanical recyclability documentation: Upon written request, suppliers shall provide documentation on mechanical recyclability of products (e.g. ISO 14021 certification as proof of self-declared “recyclable” claim). These stringent requirements have been introduced to new and renewed contracts with packaging suppliers, starting in 2024. By integrating these sustainability requirements into our contractual agreements, we aim to gain comprehensive insights into the environmental impacts of each of our packaging products, facilitating informed decision-making and identifying areas for improvement. We also aim to ensure that the materials used in packaging 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 224 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024 60 Unaudited.
