For further details see section 8.1 ‘Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss’ of the Universal Registration Document. Similar to previous years, Euronext has reviewed the application of the EU Taxonomy Regulation to its activities, taking into account the list of economic activities outlined in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Euronext has concluded that it has no eligible or aligned turnover under the Taxonomy Regulation. This includes CCM 8.1 where it was assessed Euronext does not have eligible turnover. For a full list of Euronext's activities, please refer to section 7.1.3 of the Universal Registration Document on Sources of Revenue. 3.2.1.1.2 Operating Expenditure In compliance with the Disclosure Delegated Act, total OpEx is calculated by assessing all direct non-capitalised costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, as well as other direct expenditures necessary for the day-to-day servicing of property, plant, and equipment assets. This assessment is then compared with the economic activities defined in the various Annexes to the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Euronext Operational Expenditures are related to assets and processes associated with Taxonomy eligible economic activities. In the previous year, due to the lack of clarity on OpEx denominator calculation, it was decided to use the same OpEx as the one in the financials. For 2024, with more clarity over methodology from taxonomy, it was calculated using only categories that are aligned with those from taxonomy regulation like: ■Software and hardware maintenance; ■Facilities services and repair. ■Buildings renovations. ■Short-term leases. There are no other operational expenditures related to day to day servicing items related to Property, Plant, and Equipment that are not identified in the categories above. In 2024 Euronext identified activities related to facilities and data centres maintenance that were able to be classified as eligible for OpEx. 3.2.1.1.3 Capital Expenditure Under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the CapEx denominator is defined as the total capital expenditure reported in the financial statements, encompassing investments in property, plant, and equipment (PPE) in accordance with IAS 16, right-of- use assets under IFRS 16, and intangible assets as defined by IAS 38, excluding goodwill. This figure is presented without depreciation, amortization, remeasurement, or changes to fair value. (See the rows ""Additions"" and ""Acquisition of Subsidiaries"" in Chapter 8, Note 16, Table Property, Plant and Equipment; Note 17, Table Leases; and Note 18, Table Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Financial Statements). Euronext calculates the proportion of qualifying CapEx by comparing it with the economic activities defined in the various Annexes to the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Investment expenses include all additions to tangible and intangible assets. Currently, Euronext does not have a CapEx investment plan in place. 3.2.1.2 2024 Taxonomy underlying analysis Euronext has identified and analysed the following economic activities in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts that could potentially give rise to aligned investment expenses: ■Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2) ■Installation, maintenance and repair of technologies for renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6) ■Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) ■Data processing, hosting, and related services (CCM 8.1) 3.2.1.2.1 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2) Euronext is aware of the November 2024 Draft Commission Notice that clarifies purchase of output for CapEx and OpEx should be considered for all environmental objectives. Euronext acknowledges that some of its IT CapEx could be eligible when applying this interpretation, specifically within activity 1.2, ""Manufacture of Electrical and Electronic Equipment"", of the EU Taxonomy. Euronext will further assess these CapEx once the Draft Commission Notice is finalized in the future to determine their eligibility and alignment with relevant criteria and sustainability objectives. 3.2.1.2.2 Installation, maintenance and repair of technologies for renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6) At the Euronext Dublin office, solar panels were installed to increase the use of renewable energy. This investment represented a cost of €37,000, related to Property, Plant, and Equipment. After reviewing this CapEx, the latter was considered eligible with the EU Taxonomy under the Climate Change Mitigation objective. 3.2.1.2.3 Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) In 2024, Euronext recorded approximately €16.3 million in CapEx leases, related to right of use assets including acquisition of subsidiaries, for multiple office buildings (for more details see Note 17 on Leases in the Financial Statements). Following a detailed assessment, it determined that these leases met the eligibility criteria for the Climate Change Empower Sustainable Finance 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 97 (1) Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC Text with EEA relevance"

"Mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, specifically under Activity 7.7 (Acquisition and Ownership of Buildings). This conclusion was based on the commission notice (C/2024/6691), which explicitly states that leases can be considered eligible under the EU Taxonomy. However, due to insufficient information from the vendor, the Group was unable to assess compliance with the alignment criteria. 3.2.1.2.4 Data Processing, hosting, and related services (CCM 8.1) In 2024, Euronext recorded approximately €5.3 million in CapEx, related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, related to its data centres infrastructure (for more details see Note 16 on Property, Plant, and Equipment). Following a detailed assessment, it determined that these CapEx met the eligibility criteria for the Climate Change Mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, specifically under Activity 8.1 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). 3.2.2 Climate Change Material topic Description Climate Change Impact on global warming through energy use and scope 3 GHG-emissions from the upstream and downstream supply chain (mostly purchase of goods and services, and business travel). Actual Negative Impact Impact on global warming through scope 1 - 2 GHG-emissions of own offices and data centres, taking into account use of (renewable) energy and energy efficiency measures. 3.2.2.1 Governance Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes (ESRS 2 GOV-3) Please refer to section 3.1.4.4. of the Universal Registration Document, which discusses the integration of sustainability- related performance in incentive schemes. Additionally, for more details on remuneration structure, refer to the Remuneration report on section 4.4 of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.2 Strategy Between 2021 and 2024, under its ""Growth for Impact 2024"" strategic plan, Euronext focused on accelerating climate action—both within Euronext’s own operations and through its role in advancing sustainable finance across all its markets. This commitment also encompassed an ambitious 1.5° climate goal for Euronext, and included developing services and products that help businesses, partners, clients and the European economy in general to ensure the increase in global temperatures from pre-industrial times remains below the 1.5°C target, as set out in the Paris Agreement. For the next strategic cycle “Innovate for Growth 2027"" 2024-2027, Euronext has renewed its commitment to support its clients throughout their climate journey, and further develop efficient ESG products and advisory services. Additionally, Euronext committed to set science-based net zero targets by 2027 in its own operations. In this context, Euronext has joined the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance, part of the global coalition ‘Race to Zero’. Euronext’s climate strategy is detailed in the company's Transition Plan, outlining the key measures Euronext is taking to align its activities with a sustainable future. Central to this strategy are Euronext's decarbonisation commitments, which guide its efforts to reduce emissions in line with global climate goals. To operationalise Euronext’s climate strategy, the company has established a robust internal framework which is outlined in the Environmental Policy. Furthermore, Euronext’s detailed action plan highlights the concrete steps Euronext has already implemented, ensuring accountability and progress as the Group transitions towards a more sustainable and resilient operational model. Undertaken actions in 2024 are detailed in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document 3.2.2.2.1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-1) Euronext disclosed in 2024 the latest version of its climate transition plan, demonstrating to capital markets and stakeholders that the company is committed to achieving a 1.5° pathway, and that its business model will remain relevant (i.e., profitable) in a net-zero carbon economy. This document has been approved by the Managing Board in September 2023 and can be found on Euronext's website. Any future amendments will be subject to the same approval process. Euronext's Climate Transition Plan outlines the company's transition toward a low-carbon economy, detailing its Fit 1.5 strategy, key actions, milestones, and ambitions. The Transition Plan also sheds light on Euronext's environmental governance framework. Euronext’s business model does not have locked-in emissions. Unlike industries reliant on physical infrastructure or production-based carbon outputs, the company’s operations focus on facilitating financial transactions and services. The infrastructure the Group uses, such as its buildings and data centres, has a relatively lower environmental footprint and offers greater flexibility for decarbonisation. Additionally, Euronext does not operate in a CapEx-intensive industry and, therefore, does not have a CapEx plan linked to its transition plan. However, Euronext may in the future have some Taxonomy-aligned CapEx and/or OpEx reflecting its efforts to greenify its buildings and IT infrastructure. 3 Empower Sustainable Finance 98 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT"
