"3.2.1 EU Taxonomy disclosure 3.2.1.1 2024 Taxonomy disclosure Since 2021, the EU Taxonomy on Sustainable Economic Activities has applied to Euronext, requiring mandatory disclosures under Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation1. This regulation establishes a standardised classification system to identify environmentally sustainable economic activities. An activity is taxonomy-eligible if listed in the Taxonomy Delegated Acts, regardless of meeting technical screening criteria. It becomes taxonomy-aligned when it: ■Substantially contributes to one of six environmental objectives under the Technical Screening Criteria (TSC), which are: – Climate change mitigation – Climate change adaptation – Sustainable use of water and marine resources – Transition to a circular economy – Pollution prevention and control – Biodiversity and ecosystem protection ■Does no significant harm (DNSH) to other objectives. ■Complies with minimum social safeguards (MSS). The Technical Screening Criteria (TSC) set specific requirements for an activity’s contribution to sustainability goals. These are detailed in the following Delegated Acts : ■Climate Delegated Act2 – Covers criteria for climate objectives, i.e. climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. ■Environmental Delegated Act3 – Covers non-climate environmental objectives, i.e. sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control and protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. ■Complementary Climate Delegated Act4 – Includes nuclear and gas energy under strict conditions (not applicable to Euronext). Under Article 8, Euronext must disclose the extent to which its activities are taxonomy-eligible and aligned, reporting the proportion of: ■Turnover from products and services associated with sustainable economic activities. ■Capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenditure (OpEx) related to sustainable activities. The taxonomy is primarily designed for industry-related activities, and Euronext does not expect to report significant amounts under this framework. For 2024, It was concluded that all of Euronext revenues are non-eligible and non-aligned. However, the company identified eligible CapEx and OpEx, but no alignment. All reportable figures are validated by comparing the invoice with the activity amounts reported avoiding double counting. For more details on these, as defined by the European Regulation5, please read the standard taxonomy reporting tables on section 3.5.3. of the Universal Registration Document.

The net total turnover International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82 (a), as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008. For further details see section 8.1 ‘Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss’ of the Universal Registration Document. Similar to previous years, Euronext has reviewed the application of the EU Taxonomy Regulation to its activities, taking into account the list of economic activities outlined in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Euronext has concluded that it has no eligible or aligned turnover under the Taxonomy Regulation. This includes CCM 8.1 where it was assessed Euronext does not have eligible turnover. For a full list of Euronext's activities, please refer to section 7.1.3 of the Universal Registration Document on Sources of Revenue. 3.2.1.1.2 Operating Expenditure In compliance with the Disclosure Delegated Act, total OpEx is calculated by assessing all direct non-capitalised costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, as well as other direct expenditures necessary for the day-to-day servicing of property, plant, and equipment assets. This assessment is then compared with the economic activities defined in the various Annexes to the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Euronext Operational Expenditures are related to assets and processes associated with Taxonomy eligible economic activities. In the previous year, due to the lack of clarity on OpEx denominator calculation, it was decided to use the same OpEx as the one in the financials. For 2024, with more clarity over methodology from taxonomy, it was calculated using only categories that are aligned with those from taxonomy regulation like: ■Software and hardware maintenance; ■Facilities services and repair. ■Buildings renovations. ■Short-term leases. There are no other operational expenditures related to day to day servicing items related to Property, Plant, and Equipment that are not identified in the categories above. In 2024 Euronext identified activities related to facilities and data centres maintenance that were able to be classified as eligible for OpEx. 3.2.1.1.3 Capital Expenditure Under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the CapEx denominator is defined as the total capital expenditure reported in the financial statements, encompassing investments in property, plant, and equipment (PPE) in accordance with IAS 16, right-of- use assets under IFRS 16, and intangible assets as defined by IAS 38, excluding goodwill. This figure is presented without depreciation, amortization, remeasurement, or changes to fair value. (See the rows ""Additions"" and ""Acquisition of Subsidiaries"" in Chapter 8, Note 16, Table Property, Plant and Equipment; Note 17, Table Leases; and Note 18, Table Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Financial Statements). Euronext calculates the proportion of qualifying CapEx by comparing it with the economic activities defined in the various Annexes to the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Investment expenses include all additions to tangible and intangible assets. Currently, Euronext does not have a CapEx investment plan in place. 3.2.1.2 2024 Taxonomy underlying analysis Euronext has identified and analysed the following economic activities in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts that could potentially give rise to aligned investment expenses: ■Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2) ■Installation, maintenance and repair of technologies for renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6) ■Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) ■Data processing, hosting, and related services (CCM 8.1) 3.2.1.2.1 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2) Euronext is aware of the November 2024 Draft Commission Notice that clarifies purchase of output for CapEx and OpEx should be considered for all environmental objectives. Euronext acknowledges that some of its IT CapEx could be eligible when applying this interpretation, specifically within activity 1.2, ""Manufacture of Electrical and Electronic Equipment"", of the EU Taxonomy. Euronext will further assess these CapEx once the Draft Commission Notice is finalized in the future to determine their eligibility and alignment with relevant criteria and sustainability objectives. 3.2.1.2.2 Installation, maintenance and repair of technologies for renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6) At the Euronext Dublin office, solar panels were installed to increase the use of renewable energy. This investment represented a cost of €37,000, related to Property, Plant, and Equipment. After reviewing this CapEx, the latter was considered eligible with the EU Taxonomy under the Climate Change Mitigation objective. 3.2.1.2.3 Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) In 2024, Euronext recorded approximately €16.3 million in CapEx leases, related to right of use assets including acquisition of subsidiaries, for multiple office buildings (for more details see Note 17 on Leases in the Financial Statements). Following a detailed assessment, it determined that these leases met the eligibility criteria for the Climate Change Empower Sustainable Finance 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 97 (1) Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC Text with EEA relevance"
"Mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, specifically under Activity 7.7 (Acquisition and Ownership of Buildings). This conclusion was based on the commission notice (C/2024/6691), which explicitly states that leases can be considered eligible under the EU Taxonomy. However, due to insufficient information from the vendor, the Group was unable to assess compliance with the alignment criteria. 3.2.1.2.4 Data Processing, hosting, and related services (CCM 8.1) In 2024, Euronext recorded approximately €5.3 million in CapEx, related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, related to its data centres infrastructure (for more details see Note 16 on Property, Plant, and Equipment). Following a detailed assessment, it determined that these CapEx met the eligibility criteria for the Climate Change Mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, specifically under Activity 8.1 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). 3.2.2 Climate Change Material topic Description Climate Change Impact on global warming through energy use and scope 3 GHG-emissions from the upstream and downstream supply chain (mostly purchase of goods and services, and business travel).

Additionally, for more details on remuneration structure, refer to the Remuneration report on section 4.4 of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.2 Strategy Between 2021 and 2024, under its ""Growth for Impact 2024"" strategic plan, Euronext focused on accelerating climate action—both within Euronext’s own operations and through its role in advancing sustainable finance across all its markets. This commitment also encompassed an ambitious 1.5° climate goal for Euronext, and included developing services and products that help businesses, partners, clients and the European economy in general to ensure the increase in global temperatures from pre-industrial times remains below the 1.5°C target, as set out in the Paris Agreement. For the next strategic cycle “Innovate for Growth 2027"" 2024-2027, Euronext has renewed its commitment to support its clients throughout their climate journey, and further develop efficient ESG products and advisory services. Additionally, Euronext committed to set science-based net zero targets by 2027 in its own operations. In this context, Euronext has joined the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance, part of the global coalition ‘Race to Zero’. Euronext’s climate strategy is detailed in the company's Transition Plan, outlining the key measures Euronext is taking to align its activities with a sustainable future. Central to this strategy are Euronext's decarbonisation commitments, which guide its efforts to reduce emissions in line with global climate goals. To operationalise Euronext’s climate strategy, the company has established a robust internal framework which is outlined in the Environmental Policy. Furthermore, Euronext’s detailed action plan highlights the concrete steps Euronext has already implemented, ensuring accountability and progress as the Group transitions towards a more sustainable and resilient operational model. Undertaken actions in 2024 are detailed in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document 3.2.2.2.1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-1) Euronext disclosed in 2024 the latest version of its climate transition plan, demonstrating to capital markets and stakeholders that the company is committed to achieving a 1.5° pathway, and that its business model will remain relevant (i.e., profitable) in a net-zero carbon economy. This document has been approved by the Managing Board in September 2023 and can be found on Euronext's website. Any future amendments will be subject to the same approval process. Euronext's Climate Transition Plan outlines the company's transition toward a low-carbon economy, detailing its Fit 1.5 strategy, key actions, milestones, and ambitions. The Transition Plan also sheds light on Euronext's environmental governance framework. Euronext’s business model does not have locked-in emissions. Unlike industries reliant on physical infrastructure or production-based carbon outputs, the company’s operations focus on facilitating financial transactions and services. The infrastructure the Group uses, such as its buildings and data centres, has a relatively lower environmental footprint and offers greater flexibility for decarbonisation. Additionally, Euronext does not operate in a CapEx-intensive industry and, therefore, does not have a CapEx plan linked to its transition plan. However, Euronext may in the future have some Taxonomy-aligned CapEx and/or OpEx reflecting its efforts to greenify its buildings and IT infrastructure. 3 Empower Sustainable Finance 98 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT"
"ESRS E1 requires companies to disclose whether they are excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks, in accordance with the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) and 12.2 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation). This regulation requires administrators of EU Paris-aligned benchmarks to exclude from those benchmarks the companies that derive revenues over specified thresholds from certain activities (e.g., coal-, oil- or natural gas-related activities, or high-GHG-intensity electricity generation) and the companies found or estimated to significantly harm one or more of the EU Taxonomy environmental objectives. Based on its activities, Euronext does not meet any of the exclusion criteria and therefore is not subject to any exclusion from the EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. As part of its strategy to reduce its impact on Climate Change, Euronext has considered future technological developments in designing its transition plan. The Group’s approach encompasses a holistic view that integrates emerging trends such as for example, the transition towards green energy, the increasing emphasis on the “greenification” of data centres and the decarbonisation of its value chain. Transition towards green energy Euronext recognises the global shift towards renewable energy sources as a pivotal factor shaping the future landscape of GHG emissions. Euronext acknowledges the imperative to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and embrace sustainable alternatives in its operations. By aligning its strategies with the growing adoption of green energy solutions, Euronext anticipates a significant impact on its GHG emissions profile, with a reduction in its carbon footprint to transition towards a lower-carbon footprint. Greenification of data centres As a leading financial marketplace, Euronext understands the pivotal role of data centres in supporting its infrastructure and facilitating efficient operations. The company acknowledges the burgeoning trend towards the “greenification” of data centres, driven by both environmental concerns and regulatory imperatives. By embracing innovative technologies and sustainable practices in its data centre operations, the Group aims to minimise its environmental footprint while maximising operational efficiency. This entails investment in energy- efficient infrastructure, adoption of renewable energy sources, and implementation of best practices in data centre management. The migration to a sustainable data centre sets the standard for the industry and provides clients with concrete tools to improve their own carbon footprint. Decarbonisation of the value chain The Group simultaneously decided to decarbonise its upstream value chain by implementing a supplier engagement programme, ensuring to work exclusively with suppliers committed to a low-carbon economy and driven by the numerous science-based standards being developed to guide and benchmark efforts toward sustainability and emissions reductions. Currently, the Group has not yet quantified any decarbonisation measures, but plans to address this in the coming years. More information on Euronext's decarbonisation actions can be found below in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.2.2 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3) Euronext has long recognised climate change as a critical issue for its operations and activities. Moreover, the company has embedded climate change in its strategic plan since 2021, as outlined in section 3.2.2.2. of the Universal Registration Document. Following its 2024 double materiality assessment, climate change was confirmed by stakeholders as a material topic for Euronext. The company concluded that, without adequate mitigation actions, its activities could have detrimental effects on both society and the environment. Euronext acknowledges that human activities are the primary drivers of climate change, and failing to act promptly will result in catastrophic environmental and societal consequences. Euronext’s operations have an actual and negative impact on global warming through its activities. Through its operations, Euronext emits a certain amount of GHG annually, contributing to global warming and negatively affecting stakeholders across its value chain. This is driven by both scope 3 GHG emissions from its upstream and downstream supply chain - primarily through the purchase of goods, services, and business travel - and from its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions deriving from its own offices and data centres. Since 2018, Euronext has been calculating and disclosing its annual GHG emissions based with a detailed analysis of its value chain and business model. Euronext has direct control over Scope 1, Scope 2, and travel-related emissions and reports only on relevant and material Scope 3 categories. For instance, Euronext does not report on financed emissions (Category 15 of Scope 3) because its business model does not involve investment activities such as loans, equity investments, or underwriting. For a full list of scope 3 categories, see the scope of the carbon footprint described in section 3.2.2.4.1. of the Universal Registration Document. The company’s emissions occur in the following areas: ■Direct GHG emissions coming from the company’s own offices and data centres, resulting from energy consumption and operational inefficiencies. Despite efforts to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy, these operations still contribute to environmental degradation through carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2 emissions). ■Indirect GHG emissions stemming from the company’s upstream and downstream supply chain activities, particularly through the purchase of goods and services and business travel. These areas represent significant contributors to the company’s carbon footprint (Scope 3 emissions). While Euronext's activities, particularly in the realm of data processing and storage, inherently involve energy use with potential environmental impacts, Euronext's data centre consolidation strategy, highlighted by the green core data centre in Bergamo, is a testament to its dedication to minimising this footprint. This state-of-the-art facility leverages renewable energy and advanced cooling technologies to reduce the exacerbation of climate change, which can affect ecosystems, communities, and global health. By proactively addressing these concerns, Euronext aims to curtail contributions to rising temperatures that lead to extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and environmental Empower Sustainable Finance 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 99"

For 2024, with more clarity over methodology from taxonomy, it was calculated using only categories that are aligned with those from taxonomy regulation like: ■Software and hardware maintenance; ■Facilities services and repair. ■Buildings renovations. ■Short-term leases. There are no other operational expenditures related to day to day servicing items related to Property, Plant, and Equipment that are not identified in the categories above. In 2024 Euronext identified activities related to facilities and data centres maintenance that were able to be classified as eligible for OpEx. 3.2.1.1.3 Capital Expenditure Under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the CapEx denominator is defined as the total capital expenditure reported in the financial statements, encompassing investments in property, plant, and equipment (PPE) in accordance with IAS 16, right-of- use assets under IFRS 16, and intangible assets as defined by IAS 38, excluding goodwill. This figure is presented without depreciation, amortization, remeasurement, or changes to fair value. (See the rows ""Additions"" and ""Acquisition of Subsidiaries"" in Chapter 8, Note 16, Table Property, Plant and Equipment; Note 17, Table Leases; and Note 18, Table Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets in the Financial Statements). Euronext calculates the proportion of qualifying CapEx by comparing it with the economic activities defined in the various Annexes to the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Investment expenses include all additions to tangible and intangible assets. Currently, Euronext does not have a CapEx investment plan in place. 3.2.1.2 2024 Taxonomy underlying analysis Euronext has identified and analysed the following economic activities in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts that could potentially give rise to aligned investment expenses: ■Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2) ■Installation, maintenance and repair of technologies for renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6) ■Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) ■Data processing, hosting, and related services (CCM 8.1) 3.2.1.2.1 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment (CE 1.2) Euronext is aware of the November 2024 Draft Commission Notice that clarifies purchase of output for CapEx and OpEx should be considered for all environmental objectives. Euronext acknowledges that some of its IT CapEx could be eligible when applying this interpretation, specifically within activity 1.2, ""Manufacture of Electrical and Electronic Equipment"", of the EU Taxonomy. Euronext will further assess these CapEx once the Draft Commission Notice is finalized in the future to determine their eligibility and alignment with relevant criteria and sustainability objectives. 3.2.1.2.2 Installation, maintenance and repair of technologies for renewable energy technologies (CCM 7.6) At the Euronext Dublin office, solar panels were installed to increase the use of renewable energy. This investment represented a cost of €37,000, related to Property, Plant, and Equipment. After reviewing this CapEx, the latter was considered eligible with the EU Taxonomy under the Climate Change Mitigation objective. 3.2.1.2.3 Acquisition and ownership of buildings (CCM 7.7) In 2024, Euronext recorded approximately €16.3 million in CapEx leases, related to right of use assets including acquisition of subsidiaries, for multiple office buildings (for more details see Note 17 on Leases in the Financial Statements). Following a detailed assessment, it determined that these leases met the eligibility criteria for the Climate Change Empower Sustainable Finance 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 97 (1) Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on the annual financial statements, consolidated financial statements and related reports of certain types of undertakings, amending Directive 2006/43/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directives 78/660/EEC and 83/349/EEC Text with EEA relevance"
"Mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, specifically under Activity 7.7 (Acquisition and Ownership of Buildings). This conclusion was based on the commission notice (C/2024/6691), which explicitly states that leases can be considered eligible under the EU Taxonomy. However, due to insufficient information from the vendor, the Group was unable to assess compliance with the alignment criteria. 3.2.1.2.4 Data Processing, hosting, and related services (CCM 8.1) In 2024, Euronext recorded approximately €5.3 million in CapEx, related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, related to its data centres infrastructure (for more details see Note 16 on Property, Plant, and Equipment). Following a detailed assessment, it determined that these CapEx met the eligibility criteria for the Climate Change Mitigation objective of the EU Taxonomy, specifically under Activity 8.1 (Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services). 3.2.2 Climate Change Material topic Description Climate Change Impact on global warming through energy use and scope 3 GHG-emissions from the upstream and downstream supply chain (mostly purchase of goods and services, and business travel). Actual Negative Impact Impact on global warming through scope 1 - 2 GHG-emissions of own offices and data centres, taking into account use of (renewable) energy and energy efficiency measures. 3.2.2.1 Governance Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes (ESRS 2 GOV-3) Please refer to section 3.1.4.4. of the Universal Registration Document, which discusses the integration of sustainability- related performance in incentive schemes. Additionally, for more details on remuneration structure, refer to the Remuneration report on section 4.4 of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.2 Strategy Between 2021 and 2024, under its ""Growth for Impact 2024"" strategic plan, Euronext focused on accelerating climate action—both within Euronext’s own operations and through its role in advancing sustainable finance across all its markets. This commitment also encompassed an ambitious 1.5° climate goal for Euronext, and included developing services and products that help businesses, partners, clients and the European economy in general to ensure the increase in global temperatures from pre-industrial times remains below the 1.5°C target, as set out in the Paris Agreement. For the next strategic cycle “Innovate for Growth 2027"" 2024-2027, Euronext has renewed its commitment to support its clients throughout their climate journey, and further develop efficient ESG products and advisory services. Additionally, Euronext committed to set science-based net zero targets by 2027 in its own operations. In this context, Euronext has joined the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance, part of the global coalition ‘Race to Zero’. Euronext’s climate strategy is detailed in the company's Transition Plan, outlining the key measures Euronext is taking to align its activities with a sustainable future. Central to this strategy are Euronext's decarbonisation commitments, which guide its efforts to reduce emissions in line with global climate goals. To operationalise Euronext’s climate strategy, the company has established a robust internal framework which is outlined in the Environmental Policy. Furthermore, Euronext’s detailed action plan highlights the concrete steps Euronext has already implemented, ensuring accountability and progress as the Group transitions towards a more sustainable and resilient operational model. Undertaken actions in 2024 are detailed in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document 3.2.2.2.1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-1) Euronext disclosed in 2024 the latest version of its climate transition plan, demonstrating to capital markets and stakeholders that the company is committed to achieving a 1.5° pathway, and that its business model will remain relevant (i.e., profitable) in a net-zero carbon economy. This document has been approved by the Managing Board in September 2023 and can be found on Euronext's website. Any future amendments will be subject to the same approval process. Euronext's Climate Transition Plan outlines the company's transition toward a low-carbon economy, detailing its Fit 1.5 strategy, key actions, milestones, and ambitions. The Transition Plan also sheds light on Euronext's environmental governance framework. Euronext’s business model does not have locked-in emissions. Unlike industries reliant on physical infrastructure or production-based carbon outputs, the company’s operations focus on facilitating financial transactions and services. The infrastructure the Group uses, such as its buildings and data centres, has a relatively lower environmental footprint and offers greater flexibility for decarbonisation. Additionally, Euronext does not operate in a CapEx-intensive industry and, therefore, does not have a CapEx plan linked to its transition plan. However, Euronext may in the future have some Taxonomy-aligned CapEx and/or OpEx reflecting its efforts to greenify its buildings and IT infrastructure. 3 Empower Sustainable Finance 98 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT"
"ESRS E1 requires companies to disclose whether they are excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks, in accordance with the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) and 12.2 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818 (Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation). This regulation requires administrators of EU Paris-aligned benchmarks to exclude from those benchmarks the companies that derive revenues over specified thresholds from certain activities (e.g., coal-, oil- or natural gas-related activities, or high-GHG-intensity electricity generation) and the companies found or estimated to significantly harm one or more of the EU Taxonomy environmental objectives. Based on its activities, Euronext does not meet any of the exclusion criteria and therefore is not subject to any exclusion from the EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. As part of its strategy to reduce its impact on Climate Change, Euronext has considered future technological developments in designing its transition plan. The Group’s approach encompasses a holistic view that integrates emerging trends such as for example, the transition towards green energy, the increasing emphasis on the “greenification” of data centres and the decarbonisation of its value chain. Transition towards green energy Euronext recognises the global shift towards renewable energy sources as a pivotal factor shaping the future landscape of GHG emissions. Euronext acknowledges the imperative to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and embrace sustainable alternatives in its operations. By aligning its strategies with the growing adoption of green energy solutions, Euronext anticipates a significant impact on its GHG emissions profile, with a reduction in its carbon footprint to transition towards a lower-carbon footprint. Greenification of data centres As a leading financial marketplace, Euronext understands the pivotal role of data centres in supporting its infrastructure and facilitating efficient operations. The company acknowledges the burgeoning trend towards the “greenification” of data centres, driven by both environmental concerns and regulatory imperatives. By embracing innovative technologies and sustainable practices in its data centre operations, the Group aims to minimise its environmental footprint while maximising operational efficiency. This entails investment in energy- efficient infrastructure, adoption of renewable energy sources, and implementation of best practices in data centre management. The migration to a sustainable data centre sets the standard for the industry and provides clients with concrete tools to improve their own carbon footprint. Decarbonisation of the value chain The Group simultaneously decided to decarbonise its upstream value chain by implementing a supplier engagement programme, ensuring to work exclusively with suppliers committed to a low-carbon economy and driven by the numerous science-based standards being developed to guide and benchmark efforts toward sustainability and emissions reductions. Currently, the Group has not yet quantified any decarbonisation measures, but plans to address this in the coming years. More information on Euronext's decarbonisation actions can be found below in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.2.2 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (ESRS 2 SBM-3) Euronext has long recognised climate change as a critical issue for its operations and activities. Moreover, the company has embedded climate change in its strategic plan since 2021, as outlined in section 3.2.2.2. of the Universal Registration Document. Following its 2024 double materiality assessment, climate change was confirmed by stakeholders as a material topic for Euronext. The company concluded that, without adequate mitigation actions, its activities could have detrimental effects on both society and the environment. Euronext acknowledges that human activities are the primary drivers of climate change, and failing to act promptly will result in catastrophic environmental and societal consequences. Euronext’s operations have an actual and negative impact on global warming through its activities. Through its operations, Euronext emits a certain amount of GHG annually, contributing to global warming and negatively affecting stakeholders across its value chain. This is driven by both scope 3 GHG emissions from its upstream and downstream supply chain - primarily through the purchase of goods, services, and business travel - and from its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions deriving from its own offices and data centres. Since 2018, Euronext has been calculating and disclosing its annual GHG emissions based with a detailed analysis of its value chain and business model. Euronext has direct control over Scope 1, Scope 2, and travel-related emissions and reports only on relevant and material Scope 3 categories. For instance, Euronext does not report on financed emissions (Category 15 of Scope 3) because its business model does not involve investment activities such as loans, equity investments, or underwriting. For a full list of scope 3 categories, see the scope of the carbon footprint described in section 3.2.2.4.1. of the Universal Registration Document. The company’s emissions occur in the following areas: ■Direct GHG emissions coming from the company’s own offices and data centres, resulting from energy consumption and operational inefficiencies. Despite efforts to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of renewable energy, these operations still contribute to environmental degradation through carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2 emissions). ■Indirect GHG emissions stemming from the company’s upstream and downstream supply chain activities, particularly through the purchase of goods and services and business travel. These areas represent significant contributors to the company’s carbon footprint (Scope 3 emissions). While Euronext's activities, particularly in the realm of data processing and storage, inherently involve energy use with potential environmental impacts, Euronext's data centre consolidation strategy, highlighted by the green core data centre in Bergamo, is a testament to its dedication to minimising this footprint. This state-of-the-art facility leverages renewable energy and advanced cooling technologies to reduce the exacerbation of climate change, which can affect ecosystems, communities, and global health. By proactively addressing these concerns, Euronext aims to curtail contributions to rising temperatures that lead to extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, and environmental Empower Sustainable Finance 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 99"
"instability, thereby safeguarding the well-being of people and the planet we serve. To achieve its goals, Euronext has developed a comprehensive roadmap focused on several key actions available in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document. Additional actions will be defined in the coming year as Euronext continues to decarbonize its operations, with the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.

This includes the geographic scope of Euronext’s activities, which are primarily within Europe. Additionally, Euronext evaluates the nature of its sector of activities - financial services - which differs significantly from other more impacting sectors like manufacturing. Consequently, issues such as supplier management, critical in manufacturing due to its complex supply chains, are less relevant to Euronext, where supply chains do not involve physical goods production. The detailed criteria and processes used to identify these material impacts are disclosed in section 3.1.3.1 of the Universal Registration Document. This comprehensive approach ensures that all relevant factors influencing business conduct matters are thoroughly evaluated to determine materiality for Euronext. 3.2.2.3.1 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-2) Euronext's Environmental policy outlines the Group’s key commitments and actions to address identified impacts linked to Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation, including energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment topics. The document can be found on Euronext's website. The Environmental Policy applies comprehensively across all of Euronext's activities and operations in all geographies where it operates, extending to its employees. The Group Head of ESG & Sustainable Finance is responsible for overseeing Euronext’s Environmental Policy, which has been approved by the Managing Board. For more details on the actions covered by Euronext's Environmental Policy, see section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.3.2 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies (E1-3) To reduce its carbon footprint, Euronext has developed a comprehensive action plan and a dedicated governance has been put in place to mobilise internal actors and to facilitate the implementation of an integrated approach. Euronext's Environmental governance, outlined in the environmental policy, encompasses all pertinent departments, including IT, Facilities, Procurement, ESG, Risk, and Finance, as well as other internal stakeholders. Regular project committee meetings are held, such as for the Suppliers Engagement Programme, which is supported by a dedicated working group that convenes regularly to monitor project progress and determine subsequent actions. Additionally, a regular Steering Committee meeting is conducted, involving key business decision-makers when critical decisions are required. For more information on the governance put in place, see section 3.1.4 of the Universal Registration Document and the Sustainability Policy available on the Euronext's website. 3 Empower Sustainable Finance 100 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT"
