"Table 5. Description of relevant activities, methodologies, assumptions and emissions factors per scope and energy consumption Scope Description Relevance Scope 1 The direct emissions cover all flights under Finnair’s operational control (the parent company Finnair Plc, Norra Oy and any wet-leased flights), flights performed with assets under Finnair’s financial control (aircraft leased out by Finnair to other operators), Finnair operated ground vehicle fuel consumption and Finnair’s renewable energy production for its own use (solar power). Fuel consumption for flight operations are derived from Finnair’s own data systems and based on actual fuel consumptions (Annex 1 EU ETS Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, ‘Method A’ EU ETS Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (EU) N:o 601/2012). The CO2e emission factor for fossil jet fuel used has been 3,16 kg CO2e/kg with reference to ISO 14083:2023; Table K.1. SAF CO2e factor used has been 0 CO2e/kg as GHG Protocol guides. Fuel volume has been converted to mass using densities provided by the fuel vendor. If density has not been available, a default value of 0.80 kg/liter has been used. Ground vehicles’ fuel consumption figures have been derived from Finnair’s own refuelling station. The emission factors used for fossil fuels (petrol and fuel oil (LFO)) reference to ISO 14083:2023; Table K.1. Relevant Scope 2 Location / Market based Energy consumption figures of the corporate facilities are derived from Finnair’s facility management system. In 2024, Finnair purchased 100% wind electricity and green district heating. Both are 100% renewable and emit 0 kgCO2e/MWh. In 2023, when energy certificates were not used, 17.4 % of the district heat came from bioenergy, 11.7% of the electricity was bio-based and 18.2% was nuclear. These energy consumption mix figures have been received from the energy providers. For the years 2023 and 2024 the location-based emission factor for district heating was the same as the market-based one, being 153.7 kgCO2/MWh (source: Local Power: Emissions of the district heating network Vantaan Energia Oy - Vantaa). For electricity, location-based factor (Finland total) for the year 2023 was 52.3 kgCO2/MWh (source: Tilastokeskus/Statistics Finland). The emission factors applied do not separate the percentage of biomass used or biogenic CO2. Other GHG emissions than CO2 have also not been available. Relevant Scope 3 Description Relevance 1 Purchased goods and services Most of the products and services purchased are focused on services provided by airports, air traffic management, ground operations, and maintenance operations, excluding upstream transportation and distribution. The method used to calculate emissions has been a spend-based method applied to the total consumption of purchased goods and services. The emission factors used have been obtained from the consultant used for the preparatory work and referred mainly to CDP.

"E1-7 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits Finnair operated ground operations at Helsinki- Vantaa airport have been carbon neutral (Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 category 3) since 2023. To achieve this commitment, Finnair also has to compensate for residual emissions. The residual emissions in 2024 consisted of emissions from renewable fuel production (Scope 3, category 3 fuel production and transport) and using of fossil fuel, gasoline. Finnair also compensated 100 % of its personnel business travel by air. In 2024, WTW emissions from business travel were reduced by 15% with sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and the remaining 85% was compensated with carbon credits. The above-mentioned emissions have been compensated by externally certified voluntary emission reduction projects (VER). The compensation as a lever is not impeding nor reducing Finnair’s own GHG reduction activities. At the moment, Finnair do not have an internal procedure to manage the risk of non-permanence of the GHG removals, including determining and monitoring leakage and reversal events. Table AR 64.

"Table AR 66. Internal carbon pricing Types of internal carbon prices Volume at stake (tCO2e) Prices applied (€/tCO2e) Perimeter description Internal carbon cost (Scope 1) 3,244,093 65 The carbon price is reviewed at least on quarterly basis to reflect all regulatory costs for jet fuel. E1-8 Internal carbon pricing Finnair has included all regulatory costs related to jet fuel in its financial planning as an internal carbon price. This helps Finnair understand and manage the increasing costs associated with the environmental impact of its operations. Finnair’s fuel cost includes estimated regulatory costs for carbon dioxide emissions (EU ETS, CORSIA and SAF mandates) and covers Finnair’s total aviation fuel consumption (>99% of Scope 1 emissions). Whenever jet fuel cost related calculations are done (for example weight reduction campaigns, fleet and network planning or SAF investments), the carbon price is included automatically. The carbon price is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis to reflect the EU ETS and CORSIA carbon price, and estimated SAF mandate cost. The regulation-based carbon price can be volatile, influenced by market dynamics, policy changes, and general economic conditions. This volatility can lead to significant fluctuations in the internal carbon price, providing challenges to maintain consistent financial planning and decision-making. For example, the EU ETS price is subject to short-term market conditions, which may not be fully captured in the future cost estimations of carbon emissions.

"E4-1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model Currently, Finnair does not have a formalised transition plan, nor has it conducted a specific resilience analysis of its current business model and strategy in relation to biodiversity and ecosystem-related physical, transitional, or systemic risks. Nevertheless, these matters are integrated into Finnair’s strategic considerations and business model through the management of Finnair’s climate impacts and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) strategy. Finnair acknowledges that the use of fossil fuels contributes to climate change, which in turn has both direct and indirect impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. For disclosures regarding climate change see E1 Climate change. This section E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems of the Sustainability Report addresses specifically the biodiversity and ecosystem-related impacts and risks associated with increasing use of SAF in Finnair’s operations. SAF is central to the aviation industry’s energy transition and achievement of its sustainability objectives.

"Table AR 66. Internal carbon pricing Types of internal carbon prices Volume at stake (tCO2e) Prices applied (€/tCO2e) Perimeter description Internal carbon cost (Scope 1) 3,244,093 65 The carbon price is reviewed at least on quarterly basis to reflect all regulatory costs for jet fuel. E1-8 Internal carbon pricing Finnair has included all regulatory costs related to jet fuel in its financial planning as an internal carbon price. This helps Finnair understand and manage the increasing costs associated with the environmental impact of its operations. Finnair’s fuel cost includes estimated regulatory costs for carbon dioxide emissions (EU ETS, CORSIA and SAF mandates) and covers Finnair’s total aviation fuel consumption (>99% of Scope 1 emissions). Whenever jet fuel cost related calculations are done (for example weight reduction campaigns, fleet and network planning or SAF investments), the carbon price is included automatically. The carbon price is reviewed at least on a quarterly basis to reflect the EU ETS and CORSIA carbon price, and estimated SAF mandate cost. The regulation-based carbon price can be volatile, influenced by market dynamics, policy changes, and general economic conditions. This volatility can lead to significant fluctuations in the internal carbon price, providing challenges to maintain consistent financial planning and decision-making. For example, the EU ETS price is subject to short-term market conditions, which may not be fully captured in the future cost estimations of carbon emissions.

E5-1 Polices related to resource use and circular economy As part of its Environmental Management System (EMS) Finnair has developed a Circular Economy Policy that addresses the resource use and waste management aspects concerning Finnair’s own operations in its Helsinki-Vantaa airport home hub, with specific objectives set for Finnair Kitchen, Finnair Technical Operations, and Finnair Cargo. The Policy follows the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/ EC) and its amendments to reduce material use, reuse when possible, recycle, and recover. The Policy’s objective is to implement robust material management process in Finnair’s own operations by the end of 2025, including the identifying of most important material and waste flows, finding opportunities to minimise those, implementing the measures, and follow-up on progress. Progress is reported to the Sustainability Leadership Team on a quarterly basis by the respective operational Leadership Teams that are accountable for implementing the Policy. For more information on the governance of sustainability at Finnair, see ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Policy guidelines for minimising resource use emphasise continuous improvement in Finnair’s own operations. Aurinkomatkat operations are excluded as their resource use in own operations is minimal. Identified material sustainability matter Type Description Use of virgin resources and depletion of natural resources Negative impact The extraction of virgin resources significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. Within Finnair’s own operations, in-flight catering services cause substantial material consumption in the form of food, beverages, and packaging. Proactive engagement in the adoption of reused and recycled materials within the industry presents an opportunity to ensure material availability and achieve cost-efficiency. While aircraft manufacturing predominantly involves the use of virgin raw materials, there is potential in reducing this dependency in the medium- and long-term as the cost of virgin raw materials is expected to rise. Decreased need for virgin resources Opportunity Waste generation and non-recycling Negative impact If waste is not properly handled in Finnair’s own operations or its upstream value chain, there are potential negative impacts to the environment in the form of pollution and animal and plant diseases.

"Policy guidelines include, for example, the optimisation of over-catering in Finnair Kitchen operations as well as reducing the use of single-use packaging in Finnair Cargo. In their daily operations, Finnair Technical Operations repairs and maintains aircraft and aircraft components for re-usage, thus extending the life cycle of various aircraft parts. Waste hierarchy is addressed in the Policy in different stages of product and service life cycle. Finnair aims to design its service elements to be light, durable, and repairable to minimise material use and to prevent waste. Repairability allows for the reuse of products. Finnair aims to use recyclable materials when possible. Recycling objectives are set in the Circular Economy Policy acknowledging the animal health regulation (1069/2009/EC) which prohibits recycling of international catering waste. Due to the safety regulations in the aviation industry set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014, usage of recycled materials in aircraft is limited, whereas within the service design for inflight catering and cargo operations the use of recycled materials is encouraged. The Circular Economy Policy also addresses sustainable procurement practices in the upstream value chain and sets as an objective for implementing policy and working instructions for sustainable procurement for food and beverage. E5-2 Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy To achieve the objectives on material management, waste reduction, and recycling outlined in the Circular Economy Policy, Finnair has established a circular economy working group. The working group is responsible for overseeing the continuous improvement actions in the different functions, namely Finnair Kitchen, Finnair Technical Operations and Finnair Cargo. Action plans and resourcing for continuous improvement are approved and results monitored in each operational unit’s Leadership Team. Circular economy action plan implementation does not require significant financial investments in the short-term time horizon. According to Finnair’s sustainability governance model company-level performance is monitored in the Sustainability Leadership Team. Reducing the need for virgin materials Finnair’s product and service design addresses circularity by following a set of principles that aim to minimise virgin material need and prevent non-recyclable waste. These principles address the weight of products, preference for recycled materials, durability and maintainability as well as recyclability by, for example, preferring monomaterials. To address virgin material use and prevent food waste Finnair has established a continuous process to optimise in-flight catering. It is estimated that in 2024 this reduced the annual catering waste by 10 tonnes. Finnair has also replaced individual cosmetics in business class amenity kits with on-demand cosmetics. This has reduced the amount of packaging and prevented the amenity kits from expiring. The usage of aircraft materials and material lifetime are regulated by aviation legislation. Within those regulatory boundaries Finnair Technical Operations is keeping aircraft parts in circulation for as long as possible. New repair possibilities are also constantly evaluated and implemented whenever feasible. Finnair maintains and repairs various components within its own facilities. These include for example various structural items, cargo containers, brakes, wheels, batteries, and several types of cabin and galley equipment. In addition to its own maintenance and repair services, Finnair participates in shared component pools with other organisations. The shared inventory and repair management activities contribute to reduced need for virgin resources and optimise Finnair’s own inventory. As part of the continuous improvement agenda Finnair is currently exploring the possibility of maintaining, repairing, and reusing life vests. Waste generation and recycling Recycling of international catering waste from flights originating outside the EU is prohibited (1069/2009/ EC).

Finnair is aiming to develop understanding of its operations’ nature impacts through, for example, participation in SBTN training. The potential impacts of SAF production on biodiversity and ecosystems are evaluated to materialise in the long-term so stakeholders’ understanding is likely to increase in the future along the value chain, namely among SAF producers, regulators, and airlines.

E5-1 Polices related to resource use and circular economy As part of its Environmental Management System (EMS) Finnair has developed a Circular Economy Policy that addresses the resource use and waste management aspects concerning Finnair’s own operations in its Helsinki-Vantaa airport home hub, with specific objectives set for Finnair Kitchen, Finnair Technical Operations, and Finnair Cargo. The Policy follows the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/ EC) and its amendments to reduce material use, reuse when possible, recycle, and recover. The Policy’s objective is to implement robust material management process in Finnair’s own operations by the end of 2025, including the identifying of most important material and waste flows, finding opportunities to minimise those, implementing the measures, and follow-up on progress. Progress is reported to the Sustainability Leadership Team on a quarterly basis by the respective operational Leadership Teams that are accountable for implementing the Policy. For more information on the governance of sustainability at Finnair, see ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies.

"Policy guidelines include, for example, the optimisation of over-catering in Finnair Kitchen operations as well as reducing the use of single-use packaging in Finnair Cargo. In their daily operations, Finnair Technical Operations repairs and maintains aircraft and aircraft components for re-usage, thus extending the life cycle of various aircraft parts. Waste hierarchy is addressed in the Policy in different stages of product and service life cycle. Finnair aims to design its service elements to be light, durable, and repairable to minimise material use and to prevent waste. Repairability allows for the reuse of products. Finnair aims to use recyclable materials when possible. Recycling objectives are set in the Circular Economy Policy acknowledging the animal health regulation (1069/2009/EC) which prohibits recycling of international catering waste. Due to the safety regulations in the aviation industry set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014, usage of recycled materials in aircraft is limited, whereas within the service design for inflight catering and cargo operations the use of recycled materials is encouraged. The Circular Economy Policy also addresses sustainable procurement practices in the upstream value chain and sets as an objective for implementing policy and working instructions for sustainable procurement for food and beverage. E5-2 Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy To achieve the objectives on material management, waste reduction, and recycling outlined in the Circular Economy Policy, Finnair has established a circular economy working group. The working group is responsible for overseeing the continuous improvement actions in the different functions, namely Finnair Kitchen, Finnair Technical Operations and Finnair Cargo. Action plans and resourcing for continuous improvement are approved and results monitored in each operational unit’s Leadership Team. Circular economy action plan implementation does not require significant financial investments in the short-term time horizon. According to Finnair’s sustainability governance model company-level performance is monitored in the Sustainability Leadership Team. Reducing the need for virgin materials Finnair’s product and service design addresses circularity by following a set of principles that aim to minimise virgin material need and prevent non-recyclable waste. These principles address the weight of products, preference for recycled materials, durability and maintainability as well as recyclability by, for example, preferring monomaterials. To address virgin material use and prevent food waste Finnair has established a continuous process to optimise in-flight catering. It is estimated that in 2024 this reduced the annual catering waste by 10 tonnes. Finnair has also replaced individual cosmetics in business class amenity kits with on-demand cosmetics. This has reduced the amount of packaging and prevented the amenity kits from expiring. The usage of aircraft materials and material lifetime are regulated by aviation legislation. Within those regulatory boundaries Finnair Technical Operations is keeping aircraft parts in circulation for as long as possible. New repair possibilities are also constantly evaluated and implemented whenever feasible. Finnair maintains and repairs various components within its own facilities. These include for example various structural items, cargo containers, brakes, wheels, batteries, and several types of cabin and galley equipment. In addition to its own maintenance and repair services, Finnair participates in shared component pools with other organisations. The shared inventory and repair management activities contribute to reduced need for virgin resources and optimise Finnair’s own inventory. As part of the continuous improvement agenda Finnair is currently exploring the possibility of maintaining, repairing, and reusing life vests. Waste generation and recycling Recycling of international catering waste from flights originating outside the EU is prohibited (1069/2009/ EC).

"recycle materials. To address waste flows that can be recycled Finnair has established a process for continuous improvement where new possible material streams for recycling are identified in the operations, evaluated in the circular economy working group, and implemented within the operational units when feasible. In 2024, glass recycling for smaller aircraft types was implemented in flight operations and cardboard recycling was introduced in Finnair Cargo unit. Planned actions for 2025 include introducing cardboard recycling and recycling of small plastic bottles for flights arriving to Helsinki-Vantaa airport. This would yield approximately 20 tonnes more material directed to recycling instead of energy recovery. Recycling of cabin waste starts with sorting the waste onboard and in addition to existing guidelines, during 2025 the Finnair cabin crew will be presented with an educational video on the topic. As part of the mid-term actions, Finnair is exploring options for recycling aircraft textiles at end-of-life. This requires collaboration with both textile manufacturers and recycling facilities to ensure a sustainable life cycle for the materials. E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy Finnair has not set targets related to resource use and circular economy for the reporting period of 2024. Finnair nevertheless tracks key performance indicators related to the topic as determined in the Circular Economy Policy. The Circular Economy Policy objectives are followed monitoring two quantitative performance indicators. The first indicator is waste produced per passenger. This indicator relates to all identified impacts and risks on the resource inflows and waste as minimising the resource inflows contributes positively to waste reduction. The second performance indicator is recycling rate that relates to waste generation and the use of virgin resources. The scope of both indicators is waste generated at Finnair’s own operations at the Helsinki-Vantaa airport home hub and returning flights. Passenger number is the total number of passengers Category Weight (tonnes) Certified biological, % Recycled materials, kg and % Food and beverage 9,090 0 0 Chemicals 580 0 0 carried on Finnair flights within the reporting year. Internal targets have been set for a five-year period in 2021 and 2025 marks the last year of this journey. The base year 2021 results for these indicators were 0,34 kilograms waste per passenger and recycling rate of 22%. In 2024 the waste per passenger in own operations at Helsinki-Vantaa was 0,21 kilograms and recycling rate was 28%. E5-4 Resource inflows metrics Finnair has recognised material resource inflows in two different categories which together constitute approximately 90% of resource inflows. The biggest category is food and beverage consumed at Finnair Kitchen and outstations to produce in-flight catering. The biggest items within this category include juices, bottled water, and ready-made meals. Another important category is chemicals, where dry ice and nitrogen are the most significant items. Accompanying these, various other chemicals are utilised for their respective purposes in small quantities. In 2024, Finnair’s fleet expansion included the addition of one A350 aircraft, which weighs approximately 140 tonnes. Critical raw materials are assessed separately and their weight totals 700 kilograms, consisting of nickel, copper, titanium, and lithium. In addition, 13 tonnes of aluminium were used.

"E4-3 Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems Finnair’s identified material impacts and risks related to biodiversity are connected to the sourcing of biogenic SAF. In its operations, Finnair is committed to purchasing SAF that shall meet at least the following sustainability criteria: • The purchased SAF should generate at least 50% lower carbon emissions on a life cycle basis compared to the baseline of fossil fuel. The fossil baseline shall be the CORSIA baseline of 89 gCO2e/ MJ for impact measurement. This mitigates the impact of climate change on biodiversity. • The purchased SAF shall be validated by an external certification body (e.g., ISCC, RSB) against a recognised sustainability standards and requirements (e.g., CORSIA or EU RED). This addresses the potential adverse impact of feedstock production on biodiversity. CORSIA is a global scheme designed for international flights between participating countries, whereas EU RED applies to EU member states. There are certain differences between the requirements of CORSIA and EU RED for the sustainability principles that the SAF shall meet, namely in terms of biodiversity, conservation, ecosystem services, and impact on food production. Continuous dialogue with Finnair’s current SAF providers is conducted to ensure the compatibility of the procured SAF. Finnair is also engaging with various stakeholders from fuel providers to regulators to ensure sustainable and scalable future production of non-biogenic SAF. During 2024, Finnair participated in UN Global Compact Finland’s training program focusing on Science-based Targets for Nature (SBTN), with the aim of developing knowledge on the assessment of the nature impacts of its operations. Within 2025 Finnair also aims to introduce more thorough guidance on SAF sustainability criteria in accordance with the latest regulatory requirements and scientific findings. During 2024, no biodiversity offsets were utilised nor was local or indigenous knowledge or nature-based solutions incorporated into decision-making. For the reporting period of 2024, Finnair has not quantified the current or future operational and capital expenditures related to addressing biodiversity or ecosystem impacts. E4-4 Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems Finnair has not set targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems as there is currently not a mature enough understanding of SAF’s biodiversity and ecosystem impacts to put in place measurable and outcome- oriented targets. Finnair’s continuous objective is to protect biodiversity and ecosystems and minimise its impacts on these. This is achieved by sustainable purchasing guidelines of SAF.

"Included are the most significant resource categories by weight, covering approximately 90% of materials used in own direct operations. Information obtained for reporting mass of material inflows is based on actual weights measured for food and beverage. In approximately half of the chemicals category weights are estimates. Included are materials used in Finnair’s own direct operations, purchased by Finnair for Finnair’s own use. Food and beverage category also includes wet-lease in operations, where calculations are based on average menu weights. Categorisation has been done based on commodity codes defined by the Finnish public commodity code service, Fintaric. Value chain material use information and leased assets are not included. Since frameworks for the value chain information reporting are inconsistent and data collection inefficient at this stage, Finnair has decided to make use of the transitional provisions as defined under ESRS 1 General Requirements for the first year of reporting. Leased assets in Finnair operations are mainly vehicles and IT equipment. Whilst a significant amount of leased assets is utilised, the amount of acquired materials within the reporting year are insignificant. Metrics have not been validated by any external verifier other than the auditor of the Sustainability Report. E5-5 Resource outflows metrics In the reporting year 2024 total waste generated in Finnair’s own operations was 3,649 tonnes of which hazardous waste 71 tonnes and radioactive waste 0 kilograms. Non-recycled waste mass was 2,945 tonnes, 81% of total waste mass. The biggest waste category was international catering waste that accounted for 70% of total waste mass.

Other waste streams exceeding 1% of the total waste mass include cardboard, plastic, paper, food waste from intra-European flights, wood, and kerosine. Small amounts of waste chemicals, metals, batteries, electronics, and glass were also produced, each falling under 1% share of the total waste mass. Hazardous waste consists mainly of oil, lubricants, and kerosene. The reported figures include waste from Finnair’s own direct operations in Helsinki-Vantaa and waste generated on Finnair’s long-haul flights and disposed at outstations. This differs from the calculation of performance indicators described in E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy as those figures do not include waste left at the outstations. Reported waste amounts are obtained from waste treatment partners and are direct measurements, except for waste disposed at the outstations. In calculating the amount of waste left at outstations, an average weight of waste per passenger, determined by dividing the amount waste generated in Helsinki- Vantaa operations by passengers returning to Helsinki- Vantaa, has been used. It is assumed that all waste left at outstations is sent to landfill.

To address virgin material use and prevent food waste Finnair has established a continuous process to optimise in-flight catering. It is estimated that in 2024 this reduced the annual catering waste by 10 tonnes. Finnair has also replaced individual cosmetics in business class amenity kits with on-demand cosmetics. This has reduced the amount of packaging and prevented the amenity kits from expiring. The usage of aircraft materials and material lifetime are regulated by aviation legislation. Within those regulatory boundaries Finnair Technical Operations is keeping aircraft parts in circulation for as long as possible. New repair possibilities are also constantly evaluated and implemented whenever feasible. Finnair maintains and repairs various components within its own facilities. These include for example various structural items, cargo containers, brakes, wheels, batteries, and several types of cabin and galley equipment. In addition to its own maintenance and repair services, Finnair participates in shared component pools with other organisations. The shared inventory and repair management activities contribute to reduced need for virgin resources and optimise Finnair’s own inventory. As part of the continuous improvement agenda Finnair is currently exploring the possibility of maintaining, repairing, and reusing life vests. Waste generation and recycling Recycling of international catering waste from flights originating outside the EU is prohibited (1069/2009/ EC).

"recycle materials. To address waste flows that can be recycled Finnair has established a process for continuous improvement where new possible material streams for recycling are identified in the operations, evaluated in the circular economy working group, and implemented within the operational units when feasible. In 2024, glass recycling for smaller aircraft types was implemented in flight operations and cardboard recycling was introduced in Finnair Cargo unit. Planned actions for 2025 include introducing cardboard recycling and recycling of small plastic bottles for flights arriving to Helsinki-Vantaa airport. This would yield approximately 20 tonnes more material directed to recycling instead of energy recovery. Recycling of cabin waste starts with sorting the waste onboard and in addition to existing guidelines, during 2025 the Finnair cabin crew will be presented with an educational video on the topic. As part of the mid-term actions, Finnair is exploring options for recycling aircraft textiles at end-of-life. This requires collaboration with both textile manufacturers and recycling facilities to ensure a sustainable life cycle for the materials. E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy Finnair has not set targets related to resource use and circular economy for the reporting period of 2024. Finnair nevertheless tracks key performance indicators related to the topic as determined in the Circular Economy Policy. The Circular Economy Policy objectives are followed monitoring two quantitative performance indicators. The first indicator is waste produced per passenger. This indicator relates to all identified impacts and risks on the resource inflows and waste as minimising the resource inflows contributes positively to waste reduction. The second performance indicator is recycling rate that relates to waste generation and the use of virgin resources. The scope of both indicators is waste generated at Finnair’s own operations at the Helsinki-Vantaa airport home hub and returning flights. Passenger number is the total number of passengers Category Weight (tonnes) Certified biological, % Recycled materials, kg and % Food and beverage 9,090 0 0 Chemicals 580 0 0 carried on Finnair flights within the reporting year. Internal targets have been set for a five-year period in 2021 and 2025 marks the last year of this journey. The base year 2021 results for these indicators were 0,34 kilograms waste per passenger and recycling rate of 22%. In 2024 the waste per passenger in own operations at Helsinki-Vantaa was 0,21 kilograms and recycling rate was 28%. E5-4 Resource inflows metrics Finnair has recognised material resource inflows in two different categories which together constitute approximately 90% of resource inflows. The biggest category is food and beverage consumed at Finnair Kitchen and outstations to produce in-flight catering. The biggest items within this category include juices, bottled water, and ready-made meals. Another important category is chemicals, where dry ice and nitrogen are the most significant items. Accompanying these, various other chemicals are utilised for their respective purposes in small quantities. In 2024, Finnair’s fleet expansion included the addition of one A350 aircraft, which weighs approximately 140 tonnes. Critical raw materials are assessed separately and their weight totals 700 kilograms, consisting of nickel, copper, titanium, and lithium. In addition, 13 tonnes of aluminium were used.

"Included are the most significant resource categories by weight, covering approximately 90% of materials used in own direct operations. Information obtained for reporting mass of material inflows is based on actual weights measured for food and beverage. In approximately half of the chemicals category weights are estimates. Included are materials used in Finnair’s own direct operations, purchased by Finnair for Finnair’s own use. Food and beverage category also includes wet-lease in operations, where calculations are based on average menu weights. Categorisation has been done based on commodity codes defined by the Finnish public commodity code service, Fintaric. Value chain material use information and leased assets are not included. Since frameworks for the value chain information reporting are inconsistent and data collection inefficient at this stage, Finnair has decided to make use of the transitional provisions as defined under ESRS 1 General Requirements for the first year of reporting. Leased assets in Finnair operations are mainly vehicles and IT equipment. Whilst a significant amount of leased assets is utilised, the amount of acquired materials within the reporting year are insignificant. Metrics have not been validated by any external verifier other than the auditor of the Sustainability Report. E5-5 Resource outflows metrics In the reporting year 2024 total waste generated in Finnair’s own operations was 3,649 tonnes of which hazardous waste 71 tonnes and radioactive waste 0 kilograms. Non-recycled waste mass was 2,945 tonnes, 81% of total waste mass. The biggest waste category was international catering waste that accounted for 70% of total waste mass. This waste stream includes both food waste and packaging that has been in contact with food returning from outside the EU.

Other waste streams exceeding 1% of the total waste mass include cardboard, plastic, paper, food waste from intra-European flights, wood, and kerosine. Small amounts of waste chemicals, metals, batteries, electronics, and glass were also produced, each falling under 1% share of the total waste mass. Hazardous waste consists mainly of oil, lubricants, and kerosene. The reported figures include waste from Finnair’s own direct operations in Helsinki-Vantaa and waste generated on Finnair’s long-haul flights and disposed at outstations. This differs from the calculation of performance indicators described in E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy as those figures do not include waste left at the outstations. Reported waste amounts are obtained from waste treatment partners and are direct measurements, except for waste disposed at the outstations. In calculating the amount of waste left at outstations, an average weight of waste per passenger, determined by dividing the amount waste generated in Helsinki- Vantaa operations by passengers returning to Helsinki- Vantaa, has been used. It is assumed that all waste left at outstations is sent to landfill.

"E5 Resource use and circular economy Finnair conducted a double materiality assessment in 2023 according to the process described under ESRS 2 IRO-1 Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities. E5-1 Polices related to resource use and circular economy As part of its Environmental Management System (EMS) Finnair has developed a Circular Economy Policy that addresses the resource use and waste management aspects concerning Finnair’s own operations in its Helsinki-Vantaa airport home hub, with specific objectives set for Finnair Kitchen, Finnair Technical Operations, and Finnair Cargo. The Policy follows the EU Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/ EC) and its amendments to reduce material use, reuse when possible, recycle, and recover. The Policy’s objective is to implement robust material management process in Finnair’s own operations by the end of 2025, including the identifying of most important material and waste flows, finding opportunities to minimise those, implementing the measures, and follow-up on progress. Progress is reported to the Sustainability Leadership Team on a quarterly basis by the respective operational Leadership Teams that are accountable for implementing the Policy. For more information on the governance of sustainability at Finnair, see ESRS 2 GOV-1 The role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Policy guidelines for minimising resource use emphasise continuous improvement in Finnair’s own operations. Aurinkomatkat operations are excluded as their resource use in own operations is minimal. Identified material sustainability matter Type Description Use of virgin resources and depletion of natural resources Negative impact The extraction of virgin resources significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. Within Finnair’s own operations, in-flight catering services cause substantial material consumption in the form of food, beverages, and packaging. Proactive engagement in the adoption of reused and recycled materials within the industry presents an opportunity to ensure material availability and achieve cost-efficiency. While aircraft manufacturing predominantly involves the use of virgin raw materials, there is potential in reducing this dependency in the medium- and long-term as the cost of virgin raw materials is expected to rise. Decreased need for virgin resources Opportunity Waste generation and non-recycling Negative impact If waste is not properly handled in Finnair’s own operations or its upstream value chain, there are potential negative impacts to the environment in the form of pollution and animal and plant diseases. Not recycling valuable materials leads to increasing exploitation of virgin resources.

"Policy guidelines include, for example, the optimisation of over-catering in Finnair Kitchen operations as well as reducing the use of single-use packaging in Finnair Cargo. In their daily operations, Finnair Technical Operations repairs and maintains aircraft and aircraft components for re-usage, thus extending the life cycle of various aircraft parts. Waste hierarchy is addressed in the Policy in different stages of product and service life cycle. Finnair aims to design its service elements to be light, durable, and repairable to minimise material use and to prevent waste. Repairability allows for the reuse of products. Finnair aims to use recyclable materials when possible. Recycling objectives are set in the Circular Economy Policy acknowledging the animal health regulation (1069/2009/EC) which prohibits recycling of international catering waste. Due to the safety regulations in the aviation industry set in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014, usage of recycled materials in aircraft is limited, whereas within the service design for inflight catering and cargo operations the use of recycled materials is encouraged. The Circular Economy Policy also addresses sustainable procurement practices in the upstream value chain and sets as an objective for implementing policy and working instructions for sustainable procurement for food and beverage. E5-2 Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy To achieve the objectives on material management, waste reduction, and recycling outlined in the Circular Economy Policy, Finnair has established a circular economy working group. The working group is responsible for overseeing the continuous improvement actions in the different functions, namely Finnair Kitchen, Finnair Technical Operations and Finnair Cargo. Action plans and resourcing for continuous improvement are approved and results monitored in each operational unit’s Leadership Team. Circular economy action plan implementation does not require significant financial investments in the short-term time horizon.
