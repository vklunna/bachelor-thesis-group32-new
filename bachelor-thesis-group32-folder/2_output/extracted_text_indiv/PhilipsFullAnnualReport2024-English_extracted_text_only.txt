"8.4 Environmental information Note I Climate change Climate change has been a material topic for Philips for many years, and the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) performed in 2024 re-confirmed this. It has also been a part of senior management remuneration as further explained in Remuneration report 2024. Building on our success in achieving carbon neutrality in 2020, this chapter details how Philips aligns its climate actions with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We will set out Philips’ policy, targets and metrics, material climate-related risks and opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition. Please note that Philips is not excluded from any EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks as we do not meet any of the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Policies, metrics and targets In this section, Philips’ Environmental policy, Science Based Targets and climate action scope will be further explored. For a more detailed overview of this please refer to the Climate Resilience report. Philips’ Policy and targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Our Climate Action targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to reduce our full value chain emissions and building Philips’ adaptive capacity. These targets therefore also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. Philips set its first science-based emission reduction targets back in 2017 for its Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions, officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, Philips has stepped-up and introduced new Science Based Targets, covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (approximately 96% of our value chain emissions). We are therefore committed to collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact and reduce our footprint across the value chain. Our Scope 3 target includes the following Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories: • Category 1: Purchased goods and services • Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution • Category 6: Business travel • Category 4: Downstream transportation and distribution • Category 11: Use of sold products All other Scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the GHG Protocol and CDP reporting requirements. Capital goods (Category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), waste generated in operations (Category 5), employee commuting (Category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. Additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (Category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (Category 10), franchises (Category 14), and investments (Category 15) are not applicable to Philips'. This approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. For all of our SBTi-approved and 1.5 °C-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. These targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the SBTi and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. Please note that we have also committed to Net Zero via SBTi and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. Philips Group Science Based Targets reduction % compared to baseline Scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA) emission reduction targets Scope 1 & 2 (Baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% Scope 3 (Baseline 2020) 95% -42% In accordance with the SBTi guidance, our site specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. During our baseline year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% Scope 1 emissions and 74% Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. In 2024, 89% of our target consisted of Scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. We have therefore decarbonized our Scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with Scope 1. All our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our Science Based Targets at Group level listed above. We do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. In establishing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. More precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. In particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives.

"Despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for Scope 3 stands out as a significant year for Philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. In contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative. Actions associated with climate change In this section Philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. This includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. This section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. Philips’ energy consumption and mix In 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. This was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. Most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. As such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. We have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. This is largely driven by multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) securing the supply of renewable electricity. Prior to 2023, these included the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. To further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in Europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in Mutkalampi, Finland and a solar farm in Pontinia, Italy. In December 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in China followed by a second one in December of 2024. For all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Details regarding the attributes per country are available through RE100. EACs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of RE100. These instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. By investing in renewable energy projects through the purchase of EACs, we not only contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector, but also directly limit our carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption.

"Please note that no carbon pricing scheme associated with our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (ETS, carbon tax, etc.) has a current material impact on our financial statements. Downstream transition events Under the given low global warming scenario, it is assumed that there is strong socio-economic drive to shift towards a low-carbon economy. With more than 60% of our full value chain emissions residing downstream during the use phase of our products this is our main exposure. This could include energy efficiency policies, market forces demanding energy efficiency improvements and consumer preferences that drive technological advancements. The rapid change could lead to a situation where Philips’ current technological capabilities lag behind those of our competitors and where the locked-in GHG emissions of our products inhibit our Scope 3 target achievement. For a more detailed overview of this risk please refer to our Climate Resilience report that is available via our ESG download page. To manage this risk, we continue our focus on energy efficiency, with Energy as one of four key focal areas of our EcoDesign program. All new product introductions are expected to optimize their energy efficiency. For more information on how EcoDesign can help our target achievement besides the transition towards renewable energy please refer to Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. For a quantitative assessment of our locked-in GHG emissions associated with our products please refer to Climate change and more specifically our emission associated with purchased goods and use of sold products. Resources allocated to climate change To strengthen our climate resilience from both adaptation and mitigation perspective and meet external commitments (e.g. Science Based Targets) we have allocated resources to reducing our environmental impact and preparing for potential acute and chronic climate related risks. Past and current resources Philips has allocated resources to enhance environmental resilience, including proceeds from the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework (April 24, 2019). These funds have been invested in Green and Sustainability Eligible Projects aligned with the objectives of: • Reducing value chain emissions (climate mitigation) • Building adaptive capacity (climate adaptation) All bonds issued under the Framework follow the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018, Social Bond Principles 2018 and the ICMA Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018, to ensure that the selected and disclosed projects meet widely recognized criteria. For more information, visit https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/debt.html. We have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For climate mitigation and adaptation, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 3 million (0.3%) of our EU Taxonomy aligned CapEx related to our actions to improve energy efficiency, phase out fossil fuels and build adaptive capacity on site. Refer to our EU Taxonomy disclosures for more. We have also invested EUR 263 million in Green Innovation in 2024 to support our efforts in reducing our biggest emissions contributors which are purchased goods and use of sold products. In total, our aforementioned expenditures cover these key actions related to our decarbonization levers: • Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase • Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives • Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain • Reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon • Transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites Future resources To ensure we meet our future climate targets and continue to build our adaptive capacity, it is important that future resources are allocated to our target achievement, such as: • Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency • Development of EcoDesigned new product introductions and partnerships • Infrastructure resilience, flood defense improvements, and climate-resilient, nature-based solutions The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies: Philips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three Scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two Scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our Scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total carbon footprint. As part of our carbon footprint, Philips also reports on five Scope 3 categories. These are indirect emissions that reside either upstream or downstream and are included in our approved Science Based Target of 42% reduction by 2030. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions These are direct emissions caused by company owned and -controlled entities. For example, the burning of fossil fuels and the use of refrigerants or chemicals on-site generates Scope 1-related CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. Sites report their consumption of refrigerants, and anthropogenic or biogenic-based fuels via our internal sustainability reporting system. Consumption per resource is then aggregated across all sites and multiplied by resource-specific emission factors. This approach is being used for all industrial sites and 80% of our non-industrial sites’ floor area. For all other sites, consumption is extrapolated. For Scope 1 emissions we use two sets of emission factors. For fossil fuels and natural gases, we use the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) database (v1.1 2023 – Global Warming Potentials (GWP) 5th Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 194"

"please refer to the Climate Resilience report 2024 that can be found via our ESG download page. Most importantly our definitions for the short-, medium-, and long-term diverge from our central definition prescribed by the ESRS. This was done in consultation with other departments, to ensure perpetual business continuity and acknowledge the fact that climate related risks and opportunities generally materialize beyond a 5-year time horizon. It also accounts for the time horizons linked to our commitments.

This aligns and is embedded in our business strategy as well as financial planning. To achieve this, we focus on the following core objectives, prioritized by their potential impact. Further details on underlying assumptions are available in our Climate Resilience report, which has been approved by our administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase Since most of our climate impact occurs downstream during the use-phase of our products, we are dedicated to designing energy-efficient solutions and supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. All new product introductions adhere to our EcoDesign requirements, where energy efficiency is a key focus. This approach allows us to engineer a product portfolio optimized for energy consumption during use, which not only reduces our environmental footprint but also helps our customers lower their operational costs. Moreover, the adoption of renewable energy by our customers, also supports our use phase decarbonization by eliminating CO2-e emissions during the energy generation. We therefore actively support and encourage our customers in their transition to renewables (see Champalimaud case). Our key assumption is that electrical grids will decarbonize in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Stated Policy Scenario (SPS) or Announced Pledge Scenario (APS). Based on preliminary estimates, we expect to reduce our use phase (GHGP category 11) carbon footprint as follows: Philips Group Expected use-phase emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 2,529 2,797 – 2,330 1,590 – 98 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 2,631 2,363 – 2,829 3,570 – 5,062 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 51% 46% - 55% 69% - 98% Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives From a climate perspective, applying circular business models has the potential for significant emission reductions. By retaining materials’ value, we reduce the need for virgin resources and the energy required to produce them, resulting in lower emissions. This approach is led by our Circular Economy team through the principles of ‘use less, use longer, and use again’, which also includes our ambition of ‘closing the loop’. Circular design is one of the key focal areas of EcoDesign, which includes for example design for low weight, which reduces the need for material extraction and thereby contributes to emission reductions. It also includes designing with sustainable materials (recycled, biobased, etc.), which often require less energy to process, cutting down greenhouse gases in the sourcing and manufacturing phase. For our Personal Health segment, for example, this includes replacing virgin plastic packaging with paper-based alternatives or increasing the recycled content of the materials we use. Next, we focus on increasing circular practices at our sites and responsible waste management according to the waste hierarchy. As such we actively monitor the waste management of our industrial sites with the aim of retaining the value of materials. This is further explained in Sustainable Operations. Lastly, we initiated the process to focus on responsibly reusing products and parts at the end of their use. Among other things, this includes refurbishment, and responsible takeback. By recirculating products, parts and materials, we increase the market for used products and ensure materials are longer in use. Altogether we believe that by applying our circularity principles, we will be able to reduce our purchased goods emissions (GHGP category 1) by: Philips Group Expected purchased goods emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 904 1,023 – 872 812 – 148 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 275 156 – 307 367 – 1,031 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 23% 13% - 26% 31% - 87% Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 189"

"Our total energy efficiency slightly declined by 2%, from 25.18 MWh/million EUR sales in 2023 to 25.78 MWh/million EUR sales in 2024. As noted, this is primarily due to increase office attendance. No capital expenditures have been made related to coal, oil or gas-related economic activities. There have also not been any site-related investments in 2024 with significant locked-in GHG emissions that might impede our renewable energy and/or emission-related targets. On the contrary, by signing new long-term Power Purchase Agreements, we have been able to secure the delivery of renewable energy for the future. Philips’ gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions We report on our full value chain emissions covering approximately 96% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Compared to 2023 we have not made any changes to this reporting scope ensuring comparability. The main adjustment compared with the previous year has been the splitting of upstream transportation and distribution from downstream transportation and distribution. This is further explained in Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution. Overall, we are well underway to achieving our Science Based Targets. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% meaning that for the achievement of our long-term 2040 target we will only have to reduce our emissions by 7 kilotonnes CO2-e. Additionally, we have reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 12% meaning that in the remaining 6 years we will only have to reduce emissions by 110 kilotonnes CO2-e. This excludes the use of any carbon credits (e.g., removal or reduction projects).

This is mainly due to the restructuring at Philips that required increased travel to allow for an optimal transition. The post- pandemic increase in travel was also driven by a need to align with customers which further contributed to the increased emissions. Moving forward, we continue to electrify our lease fleet and promote online collaboration, as well as increase our efforts to move travelers to rail transport for shorter distances. With tightened travel budgets in 2025, we aim to curb the growth of travel emissions.

The reduction in use-phase emissions can mainly be explained through reduced sales volume of energy-intensive products, and changes in the sales mix towards more energy efficient products. To reduce the impact of our sold products we are implementing energy efficiency measures for our existing and future installed base. This is closely tied to our EcoDesign commitment of having all new product introductions EcoDesigned by 2025. This is further explored under EcoDesign. We are also involved in novel partnerships with our customers to ensure reduced energy consumption and increased renewable energy usage of our devices. For more information on our partnerships please refer to Advocacy activities and expenses. Philips’ GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits Although reduction is key to achieving carbon neutrality, unavoidable carbon emissions require compensation. This is achieved by the cancellation of acquired carbon credits. In 2024, we offset a total of 474 kilotonnes CO2-e, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 14.2 million medium-sized oak trees. To plant all these trees an area of 512 million m2 would be required, equivalent to 9 times the area of Manhattan. This covers our operational carbon footprint, which includes all CO2-e emissions from our sites, business travel, and transportation and distribution. We thereby address climate change outside our own value chain and contribute to the reduction of global CO2-e emissions that we cannot eliminate along our own value chain. These activities complement our existing climate strategy and are excluded from our Science Based Targets for emission reductions. Thus, ensuring that these investments do not impede the achievement of our carbon reduction targets. Philips not only offsets its operational carbon footprint by funding impactful social and environmental projects but is also proactively exploring innovative approaches to directly reduce carbon emissions in its value chain, particularly for unavoidable transport-related emissions. Although we did not use any biofuels in 2024, we do believe this is a potential lever that can help us reduce our carbon footprint in the future. For future reference we only accept biofuels from wastes, residues and by-products as feedstocks with preference for REDII Annex IX feedstocks for advanced biofuels. This strategic move not only resulted in a modest reduction of emissions, but also aligns with our commitment to nature-based solutions.

"We finance projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 12. To ensure these offsets meet our high-quality standard of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting, Philips only procures carbon credits from carbon standards that are endorsed by ICROA, such as VCS Standard and Gold Standard. Each program is also verified by an independent third party. We ensure, through our providers, that the quality criteria of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting are met. In addition, Philips has conducted site visits to some of the projects in our portfolio. None of our credits as of now are subject to corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Philips will follow the developments of Article 6 closely to understand if, and when, any of the projects might become subject to corresponding adjustments. Please note that all removal credits are associated with biogenic sinks and linked to activities outside Philips value chain. All our carbon offsets drive social, economic and environmental progress in emerging markets. In 2024 we did not retire any carbon credits from removal projects. Our projects include: Restoring ecosystems and empowering communities through tree planting In Kenya, subsistence farmers are supported to plant and maintain trees on their land through the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST). This carbon removal project enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and strengthens community resilience, providing co-benefits beyond carbon sequestration. Farmers retain ownership of the trees and their products, receiving training and a share of carbon revenues. As an Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiative, it is a nature-based solution contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard with the CCB label. Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption This carbon-emission reduction project is expected to provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. As such, this contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Protecting forests through sustainable production Deforestation is expected to be reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. Unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced, thereby contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. The forest supports the supply of water to other parts of Ethiopia and neighboring countries. It is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy In India, the energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation. This is therefore considered a technological solution that also enables an improvement in livelihoods. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Improving respiratory health and reducing deforestation through provision of clean cookstoves By supporting a range of cookstove technologies across Ghana and Kenya, the projects improve respiratory health, reduce fuel costs and reduce deforestation. As such, this project contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. This also gives people more time for paid work, thus improving prospects. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Philips’ internal carbon pricing At Philips, we apply an internal carbon shadow discount price for our IT, Real Estate, Businesses and R&D investments. If an investment may support our climate targets by reducing CO2-e emissions, the relevant Function and/or Business is encouraged to apply EUR 150 discount per saved tonne CO2-e. This enables all Functions and Businesses to incorporate climate impacts in their business case development. Furthermore, by using a discount we proactively incentivize the pursuit of sustainable projects, rather than imposing penalties on unsustainable investments. The scope spans all Philips operations and includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as all the material Scope 3 categories. There are no geographic or business-specific boundaries. This therefore covers 100% of our Scope 1 & 2 targets and approximately 95% of our gross Scope 3 emissions (96% of overall emissions). The price of EUR 150 per metric ton CO2-e is derived from the internationally recognized ReCiPe methodology, in combination with the environmental pricing provided by CE Delft. The price is also validated by an external body other than our assurance provider, namely KPMG and set in alignment with our EP&L statement. The key assumption is that the price of carbon will increase in the future. Therefore, to ensure price stability over the coming years, an uplift was applied to the price of carbon, identified by CE Delft. Please note that the internal carbon pricing is not considered in the financial statements as the assumptions in the financial statements are based on (external) market assumptions.

"scope materials within the EP&L. While biological materials like paper are suitable for biological loops, these are also materials that can be recycled and have a high rate of recyclable content. That is why the recyclable content is higher for our biological materials (100%) compared to our technical materials (50%). For our biological and renewable materials, it is important to note that in line with the 1st priority of the cascading principle, these materials are used in our products and packaging and not for energy purposes. Similar to our renewable materials, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced biological materials. The results are similar because most renewable materials are also considered biological. Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care contributed with 2.5 kilotonnes of reused materials. This includes our Circular Edition refurbished medical equipment and recirculated parts. Personal Health contributed with 0.01 kilotonnes from refurbished products. Actions Philips circular revenues, which is our overarching circularity metric, increased with 4% compared to 2023. The step-up is mainly driven by contributions from circular design, mostly from low-weight design and use of sustainable materials. Revenues associated with circular services in use-phase dropped, mainly related to reclassifying products within ‘circular service in use-phase’ to other circular revenue categories. This is also one of the main reasons why circular revenues from circular delivery and financing models increased compared to 2023. Philips Group Philips Circular revenues as % of total Philips revenues 5.5% 7.5% 1.9% 6.1% 3.3% 5.2% 9.2% 5.7% Circular services in-use phase Circular end-of-use management Circular design of software and hardware Circular delivery and financing models 2023 2024 More detailed actions to deliver on our 2025 circularity commitments are described in subsequent sections. Circular design of software and hardware Our EcoDesign program is a key driver for our Circular Economy program. One of the focal areas of EcoDesign is circularity, which encompasses, for example, the application of recycled and bio-based materials and designing for low weight, durability, disassembly, and recycling. A subset of EcoDesigned products, those which specifically outperform on the focal area of circular design, will therefore also be counted as contributing to circular revenues target metric. These include, for example, products that meet defined thresholds on reduced weight compared to competitor products or their predecessors. Durability is a product’s ability to remain functional and relevant when used as intended and can be expressed through different ways such as reliability and lifetime. At this moment, Philips cannot report on the durability of its product groups compared to industry average, as there are no publicly available industry averages for our product groups. We however continue our efforts to optimize lifetime either through circular design requirements (by outperforming on our EcoDesign requirements for ‘design for durability & reliability’ vs predecessor) or for which lifetime extensions and refurbishment can be offered. Most of our medical equipment portfolio is serviceable, including service instructions for professional maintenance, and spare parts and support availability over the product lifetime. Consumer products are being redesigned as required to meet all relevant new standards and regulations including Right to Repair regulations and the EU Battery Directive, if applicable and required. Philips strives to improve professional and consumer repairability of its products, and our design process includes tools to assess repairability. Circular manufacturing and supply In line with our ambition for fully circular operations, Philips applies Lean methodologies to improve processes and continuously reduce the environmental footprint across our sites. Circular materials management is our leading KPI and is not expressed in circular revenues. We retain as much as possible material value of our waste stream through waste management and increasing circular practices at our sites. Waste related to biological materials is taken care of according to the cascading principle, which is similar to the waste hierarchy for which we apply with regards to waste from technical materials. We team up with our supply chain partners to find circular solutions for discarded materials, for example in the ’waste to value’ initiative. For inbound supplier packaging, we aim to replace single-use packaging with more sustainable solutions like reusable boxes to contribute to our packaging waste ambitions from recycling to re-use and reduce. For example, at the Philips Personal Health Industrial Site in Zhuhai 0.8 kilotonnes of plastic waste and 0.4 kilotonnes of cardboard waste were prevented by implementing reusable plastic trays to replace cardboard box partitions and implementing circular systems in which boxes are continuously sent back to the suppliers for them to use again for the supply of future shipments. Through initiatives like this in 2024, a total of 4.8 kilotonnes of waste were prevented or reused, thereby averting end of life emissions of 3.0 kilotonnes of CO2-e (assuming incineration as end-of- life treatment).

"packaging put to market (stemming from the Philips Environmental Profit and Loss Account – EP&L) with the EU WEEE recycling rates. For products, we use a 3-year average weight put to market, and for packaging we use the weight put to market in the reporting year only. This is a slight change from last year, where we used a 3-year average for both. The change in methodology for packaging is because we assume that packaging is disposed of in the year of purchase. Due to this change, this year’s figure is not comparable to last year. Impact, risk and opportunity management In this section, Philips’ nature risk assessment approach (including risks related to resource use and circular economy), and the results of this assessment, will be explained. Philips nature risk assessment approach Philips recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing and mitigating nature-related risks to ensure business continuity and resilience. The Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) report provides information needed by investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other stakeholders to appropriately assess nature-related risks and opportunities, including those related to ESRS E5. To identify and evaluate our impacts and dependencies (actual and potential) and assess related risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy, we applied the Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare (LEAP) approach, in line with the recommended approach of TNFD. This approach constitutes four stages: Locate (Philips’ interface with nature), Evaluate (Philips’ dependencies and impacts on nature), Assess (Philips’ nature-related risks and opportunities) and Prepare (to respond to and report on material nature-related issues). This is also aligned with the recommended disclosures for Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). As part of the Locate stage, we determined the scope of our risk and opportunities assessment includes Philips’ businesses, regions, and functions focusing on Philips’ 23 manufacturing sites. To apply the LEAP approach, Philips used multiple available tools such as an external risk insurance tool (Munich Re), the Ecosystem Intelligence tool (Ecometrix), and the Philips EP&L. Local teams at our manufacturing sites were involved in the impact assessment to identify high priority nature-related risks and opportunities. As part of the improvement opportunities in developing the LEAP approach, we aim to expand the consultations with local affected stakeholders in the coming years. Philips nature risk assessment results In the Evaluate stage, the dependencies analysis results showed dependencies on the ecosystem services like resource extraction. While resource extraction occurs outside the scope of our manufacturing sites, we further assessed its dependencies and impacts on material flows based on 2023 EP&L data. See Philips material flows for more information. The highest dependencies identified are: Paper & Cardboard (29%), Plastics (29%) and Metals (21%). In terms of materials type, the highest impacts are caused by metals (including processing) (37%), PCBs (33%), and electronics components (10%). Overall, the majority of the material impacts are found in the upstream value chain. As part of the Assess stage, we applied the same time horizons in the climate-related risk assessments. These timeframes are agreed in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) for ‘halting and reversing nature loss’ and ‘living in harmony with nature’. See Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. The main physical and transitional risks include: Physical Philips only uses limited amounts of water, but four manufacturing sites are located in water- stressed regions. Continued and/or expansion of business operations could place additional stress on scarcer water supply. Transitional A high priority risk identified is the volatility of costs of materials due to change in global abundance of resources: Our analysis suggests that the highest risk stems from rising costs from material scarcity due to various geopolitical drivers as well as developments in the non-renewables market in the upstream value chain. Secondly, Philips could face challenges in incorporating EcoDesign criteria from new or upcoming legislation into its products and services. The Prepare phase establishes metrics and targets related to nature-related dependencies and impacts. These have been set as part of our ESG 2025 commitments. For targets linked to circularity of resource inflows, outflows and waste management, see Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets. Allocated Resources to Resource use and circular economy To support the transition towards a circular economy and ensure we meet our external circularity commitments, we have allocated resources. Past and current resources Part of Philips resources is from the proceeds of the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds that were issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework dated April 24, 2019. Refer to Climate change for more information. In addition to the proceeds, we also have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For circular economy, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 83 million (13%) of our CapEx related to our actions to grow circular revenue sales from 'Circular delivery and financing models' and 'Circular end-of-use management'. The former amounts to EUR 72 million from 'CE4.1 Provision of IT/OT data driven solutions' and 'CE5.5. Product-as-a-service and other circular use- and result oriented services'. Their expenditures relate mainly to property, plant, equipment and Right-of-Use assets (75%) followed by intangible assets (25%). The expenditures of ‘Circular end-of-use management’ amounts to EUR 11 million from 'CE5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing' and 'CE5.2 Sales of spare parts'. Their expenditures only relate to property, plant, equipment and Right-of-Use assets. Approximately EUR 361 million (19%) of our OpEx expenditures relate primarily to our actions to grow circular revenue sales from 'Circular delivery and financing models'.

"Note II Resource use and circular economy For Philips, resource use and circular economy has, similar to climate change, been a material topic for many years, reconfirmed also by the DMA conducted in 2024. Our first circularity targets were established in the 1990s when we set recycling targets for our manufacturing sites. Since then, we have continued with waste related targets that build on established measurements in line with global waste standards. Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment. This was followed by another commitment in 2018 at Davos to ‘close the loop’ of our large medical equipment, recognizing the need to also take responsible care of them at their end-of-use. This chapter details Philips’ policies, targets, metrics, impacts, risks, opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition towards sustainable resource use and a circular economy. Policies, metrics and targets Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets Our circularity targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to maximize value with minimal consumption of virgin and non-renewable materials. Philips looks at circularity in its broadest sense, meaning that we do not only address the type and weight of the materials we use, but also, for example, dematerialization (e.g. through digitalization), efficiency (e.g., improving utilization), optimizing products-in-use (e.g. upgrades) and take-back of our products at end-of- use. The accompanying table shows how our 2025 circularity targets relate to increasing the circularity of our resource inflows and outflows while reducing waste. These targets also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use.

"Note II Resource use and circular economy For Philips, resource use and circular economy has, similar to climate change, been a material topic for many years, reconfirmed also by the DMA conducted in 2024. Our first circularity targets were established in the 1990s when we set recycling targets for our manufacturing sites. Since then, we have continued with waste related targets that build on established measurements in line with global waste standards. Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment. This was followed by another commitment in 2018 at Davos to ‘close the loop’ of our large medical equipment, recognizing the need to also take responsible care of them at their end-of-use. This chapter details Philips’ policies, targets, metrics, impacts, risks, opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition towards sustainable resource use and a circular economy. Policies, metrics and targets Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets Our circularity targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to maximize value with minimal consumption of virgin and non-renewable materials. Philips looks at circularity in its broadest sense, meaning that we do not only address the type and weight of the materials we use, but also, for example, dematerialization (e.g. through digitalization), efficiency (e.g., improving utilization), optimizing products-in-use (e.g. upgrades) and take-back of our products at end-of- use. The accompanying table shows how our 2025 circularity targets relate to increasing the circularity of our resource inflows and outflows while reducing waste. These targets also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use.

"Connected Care Connected Care’s EcoHero revenues were 5.6% in 2024. Examples of an EcoHero include patient monitors MX750 and MX850. In comparison to it's predecessor (MX800) the MX850 and the MX750 have a significant better energy efficiency. For the MX850 the energy consumption is reduced by 20%, for the MX750 around 30%. With EUR 3.0 billion, Green Revenues amounted to 59% of total. An example is the Philips EcoDesigned PageWriter TC35 cardiograph, with reduced power in on-mode compared to its predecessors TC 20 and TC 30. Personal Health EcoHero revenues from Personal Health were 17.1% in 2024. One example of an EcoHero for Personal Health is the Oral Healthcare Brush Head with biobased content. In our Mother and Child Care portfolio, Philips launched a new baby monitor with 50% mechanically recycled ABS material in the housing, coming in a paper based packaging. With EUR 3.3 billion, Green Revenues were equivalent to 96% of total sales, demonstrating the maturity of the Personal Health business in EcoDesign. Waste In 2024, our manufacturing sites generated 20 kilotonnes of waste, an increase of 4% compared to 2023, mainly driven by the increased amount of reused materials reported from our two sites in the US. The reused materials represent 13% of the total waste in 2024 compared to the 9% in 2023. In the Personal Health segment the waste increased significantly, by 19% due to increased operational waste of the reused materials. Diagnosis & Treatment waste in 2024 was comparable to 2023. Connected Care decreased waste by 31% due to decrease in operational waste at Sleep & Respiratory Care Sites.

We extended the scope with materials sent for re-use and other recovery as of 2021. Total waste does not include waste prevented. Materials delivered for re-use, other recovery or recycling via an external contractor amounted to 18,485 tonnes, which equals 92% of the total waste. Non-recycled waste, classified as materials delivered to incineration and landfill amounted to 1,672 tonnes, which equals 8% of the total waste of which 67% comprised non-hazardous waste and 33% hazardous waste. The total amount of non-recycled waste (subtracting recycled waste from total waste) is 4,211 tonnes, which equals 21% of the total waste of which 2,528 tonnes are prepared for reuse. We recorded 2,314 tonnes of waste prevented in our own activities in 2024, compared to 1,531 tonnes in 2023. Philips did not produce any radioactive waste in 2024.

There is no waste generated that is destined for other disposal methods. Our sites addressed both the Circular Materials Management percentage as well as waste sent to landfill, as part of our ESG commitments; refer to Definitions and abbreviations for the definition of Circular Materials Management. The Circular Materials Management percentage has replaced the recycling percentage in 2021. In 2024, 94% was achieved compared to 91% in 2023, the change was mainly driven by improving operational waste management for instance through reuse of materials and through establishing new partnerships for previously non-recycled materials. Our Zero Waste to Landfill KPI excludes one-time-only waste and waste delivered to landfill due to regulatory requirements. According to this definition, in 2024 our manufacturing sites reported 1.1 tonnes of waste sent to landfill, a significant decrease compared to 2.7 tonnes in 2023. All our 23 industrial sites achieved Zero Waste to Landfill status in 2024.
