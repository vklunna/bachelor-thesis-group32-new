"8.4 Environmental information Note I Climate change Climate change has been a material topic for Philips for many years, and the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) performed in 2024 re-confirmed this. It has also been a part of senior management remuneration as further explained in Remuneration report 2024. Building on our success in achieving carbon neutrality in 2020, this chapter details how Philips aligns its climate actions with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We will set out Philips’ policy, targets and metrics, material climate-related risks and opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition. Please note that Philips is not excluded from any EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks as we do not meet any of the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Policies, metrics and targets In this section, Philips’ Environmental policy, Science Based Targets and climate action scope will be further explored. For a more detailed overview of this please refer to the Climate Resilience report. Philips’ Policy and targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Our Climate Action targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to reduce our full value chain emissions and building Philips’ adaptive capacity. These targets therefore also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. Philips set its first science-based emission reduction targets back in 2017 for its Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions, officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, Philips has stepped-up and introduced new Science Based Targets, covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (approximately 96% of our value chain emissions). We are therefore committed to collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact and reduce our footprint across the value chain. Our Scope 3 target includes the following Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories: • Category 1: Purchased goods and services • Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution • Category 6: Business travel • Category 4: Downstream transportation and distribution • Category 11: Use of sold products All other Scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the GHG Protocol and CDP reporting requirements. Capital goods (Category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), waste generated in operations (Category 5), employee commuting (Category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. Additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (Category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (Category 10), franchises (Category 14), and investments (Category 15) are not applicable to Philips'. This approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. For all of our SBTi-approved and 1.5 °C-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. These targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the SBTi and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. Please note that we have also committed to Net Zero via SBTi and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. Philips Group Science Based Targets reduction % compared to baseline Scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA) emission reduction targets Scope 1 & 2 (Baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% Scope 3 (Baseline 2020) 95% -42% In accordance with the SBTi guidance, our site specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. During our baseline year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% Scope 1 emissions and 74% Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. In 2024, 89% of our target consisted of Scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. We have therefore decarbonized our Scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with Scope 1. All our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our Science Based Targets at Group level listed above. We do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. In establishing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. More precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. In particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives.

"Despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for Scope 3 stands out as a significant year for Philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. In contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative. Actions associated with climate change In this section Philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. This includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. This section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. Philips’ energy consumption and mix In 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. This was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. Most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. As such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. We have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. This is largely driven by multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) securing the supply of renewable electricity. Prior to 2023, these included the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. To further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in Europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in Mutkalampi, Finland and a solar farm in Pontinia, Italy. In December 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in China followed by a second one in December of 2024. For all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Details regarding the attributes per country are available through RE100. EACs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of RE100. These instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. By investing in renewable energy projects through the purchase of EACs, we not only contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector, but also directly limit our carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption. For more information on our renewable energy strategy please refer to the renewable energy methodology.

"Our total energy efficiency slightly declined by 2%, from 25.18 MWh/million EUR sales in 2023 to 25.78 MWh/million EUR sales in 2024. As noted, this is primarily due to increase office attendance. No capital expenditures have been made related to coal, oil or gas-related economic activities. There have also not been any site-related investments in 2024 with significant locked-in GHG emissions that might impede our renewable energy and/or emission-related targets. On the contrary, by signing new long-term Power Purchase Agreements, we have been able to secure the delivery of renewable energy for the future. Philips’ gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions We report on our full value chain emissions covering approximately 96% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Compared to 2023 we have not made any changes to this reporting scope ensuring comparability. The main adjustment compared with the previous year has been the splitting of upstream transportation and distribution from downstream transportation and distribution. This is further explained in Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution. Overall, we are well underway to achieving our Science Based Targets. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% meaning that for the achievement of our long-term 2040 target we will only have to reduce our emissions by 7 kilotonnes CO2-e. Additionally, we have reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 12% meaning that in the remaining 6 years we will only have to reduce emissions by 110 kilotonnes CO2-e. This excludes the use of any carbon credits (e.g., removal or reduction projects).

Our Scope 3 target includes the following Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories: • Category 1: Purchased goods and services • Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution • Category 6: Business travel • Category 4: Downstream transportation and distribution • Category 11: Use of sold products All other Scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the GHG Protocol and CDP reporting requirements. Capital goods (Category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), waste generated in operations (Category 5), employee commuting (Category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. Additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (Category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (Category 10), franchises (Category 14), and investments (Category 15) are not applicable to Philips'. This approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. For all of our SBTi-approved and 1.5 °C-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. These targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the SBTi and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. Please note that we have also committed to Net Zero via SBTi and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. Philips Group Science Based Targets reduction % compared to baseline Scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA) emission reduction targets Scope 1 & 2 (Baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% Scope 3 (Baseline 2020) 95% -42% In accordance with the SBTi guidance, our site specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. During our baseline year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% Scope 1 emissions and 74% Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. In 2024, 89% of our target consisted of Scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. We have therefore decarbonized our Scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with Scope 1. All our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our Science Based Targets at Group level listed above. We do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. In establishing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. More precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. In particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives.

"Despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for Scope 3 stands out as a significant year for Philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. In contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative. Actions associated with climate change In this section Philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. This includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. This section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. Philips’ energy consumption and mix In 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. This was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. Most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. As such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. We have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. This is largely driven by multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) securing the supply of renewable electricity. Prior to 2023, these included the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. To further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in Europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in Mutkalampi, Finland and a solar farm in Pontinia, Italy. In December 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in China followed by a second one in December of 2024. For all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Details regarding the attributes per country are available through RE100. EACs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of RE100. These instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. By investing in renewable energy projects through the purchase of EACs, we not only contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector, but also directly limit our carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption.

"Our total energy efficiency slightly declined by 2%, from 25.18 MWh/million EUR sales in 2023 to 25.78 MWh/million EUR sales in 2024. As noted, this is primarily due to increase office attendance. No capital expenditures have been made related to coal, oil or gas-related economic activities. There have also not been any site-related investments in 2024 with significant locked-in GHG emissions that might impede our renewable energy and/or emission-related targets. On the contrary, by signing new long-term Power Purchase Agreements, we have been able to secure the delivery of renewable energy for the future. Philips’ gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions We report on our full value chain emissions covering approximately 96% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Compared to 2023 we have not made any changes to this reporting scope ensuring comparability. The main adjustment compared with the previous year has been the splitting of upstream transportation and distribution from downstream transportation and distribution. This is further explained in Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution. Overall, we are well underway to achieving our Science Based Targets. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% meaning that for the achievement of our long-term 2040 target we will only have to reduce our emissions by 7 kilotonnes CO2-e. Additionally, we have reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 12% meaning that in the remaining 6 years we will only have to reduce emissions by 110 kilotonnes CO2-e. This excludes the use of any carbon credits (e.g., removal or reduction projects).

"Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions At our sites, we reduced our Scope 1 (direct) CO2-e emissions by 10% and increased our Scope 2 (market-based approach) CO2-e emissions by 1% compared to 2023. Scope 1 emissions include the emissions from direct fuel consumption and refrigerant use, while Scope 2 (market-based) emissions cover non-renewable electricity and purchased (city/district) heating, cooling, and steam. In line with our environmental policy, we are actively implementing energy efficiency measures, phasing out fossil fuels, and procuring renewable electricity to meet our Science Based Targets for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This commitment is further underscored by our pursuit of ISO 50001 certification for our manufacturing sites, enabling a systematic approach to continuous energy management improvements. For more information on our energy performance please refer to Philips’ energy consumption and mix. Although we have already achieved our 2025 SBTi targets, we are committed to accelerating our Scope 1 and 2 decarbonization efforts by reducing overall energy consumption and sourcing alternative renewable energy solutions. This ensures we remain on track to meet our long-term 2040 Science Based Target. As part of our reporting obligations, we are also committed to disclosing emissions per greenhouse gas type, where available. We do this for our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as these are under our direct operational control. Knowing which greenhouse gases contribute the most to our footprint allows us to scrutinize the underlying processes and if needed take corrective actions. In accordance with international reporting requirements, emissions from each of the gases are weighted by their Global Warming Potential (GWP), so that total Greenhouse Gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis. For an overview of the respective GWPs per fuel please refer to Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies. Philips Group Greenhouse Gas emissions per gas type in tonnes CO2-equivalent 2023 2024 Scope 1 Carbon dioxide (CO2) 18,267 16,971 Methane (CH4) 25 25 Nitrous oxide (N20) 13 10 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) 1,297 550 Perfluorinated carbons (PFC) 0 0 Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) 5 4 Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) 249 223 Scope 2 (Market based) Carbon dioxide (CO2) 2,118 2,160 Methane (CH4) 12 12 Nitrous oxide (N20) 7 7 Total amount of emissions 21,993 19,962 Scope 3, Category 1 - Purchased Goods and Services Our emissions from purchased goods and services were 1,396 kilotonnes CO2-e in 2024. This is a reduction of 19% compared to the 2020 baseline and a 8% reduction compared to 2023. The main reason for this reduction is the reduced sales volume of Philips in 2024 vs 2023 and the shift in our product portfolio reducing the per unit purchased goods emissions. To further reduce these emissions towards our 2030 SBTi target and Net Zero commitment, we are driving action through our Circular Economy and EcoDesign programs, applying the principles ’use less, use longer and use again’. For more information on our actions associated with the Circular Economy program please refer to Resource use and circular economy. For more information on how we are planning to decarbonize our purchased goods and service emissions in the future please refer to Philips’ transition plan. We also announced at COP26 our plan to step up our acclaimed Supplier Sustainability program with the goal of having at least 50% of our suppliers (based on spend) committing to Science Based Targets for CO2-e emissions reduction by 2025. This will help amplify our impact reducing emissions across the supply chain. For more information please refer to Supplier sustainability & Workers in the value chain. Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution In 2024, we split our upstream transportation and distribution emissions from our downstream transportation and distribution. This adds a level of granularity to our report that we were not able to provide in previous years. To ensure comparability across the years we have decided to use the same proportionate split between upstream and downstream for all historic years up to our baseline year 2020. This change has therefore not impacted our total value chain emissions but merely added more granularity. Overall, we recorded an increase of 11% in our emissions from our Transportation and Distribution compared to 2023. The reason for this increase is primarily driven by the updated BEIS emission factors that have increased by 20% compared to our 2023 emission factors (for long haul flights). This is a variable that we are not able to influence and therefore out of our control. Looking at the variables we are able to influence, we have successfully reduced our total number of air freight shipments by 2% which has mitigated the increase in emission factors. This reduction in air freight shipments can be associated with several business specific projects. These among others include the Magnet by Ocean project, where we shifted several up- and downstream lanes from air freight to ocean freight, and the shipment consolidation project, where we group multiple shipments in one to reduce the total number of shipments. It is also important to note that Philips was the first healthcare company to sign the coZEV ambition statement for Sustainable Maritime Freight Shipping. This will support our efforts in accelerating maritime decarbonization.

"other stakeholders to appropriately assess and price climate-related risks and opportunities. Please see the visual below for an indication of Philips’ climate-related risks and opportunities. Philips Group Climate risks and opportunities 2024 For the physical risk (including both climate and nature related risks) assessment, a range of Philips sites are evaluated over short-, medium-, and long-term and the expected impact on them due to acute and chronic physical risks. This is done using a high global warming scenario with expected average temperature increase of above 4 degrees Celsius (RCP8.5 – SSP5). Transition risks on the other hand are globally assessed across the short-, medium-, and long-term, encompassing both upstream and downstream activities and their potential impact. This done using a low global warming scenario in line with the Paris ambition of keeping global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius (RCP1.9 – SSP1, IEA APS, IEA SPS). The assessment of each risk is conducted by a multi-disciplinary team, consisting of members of Philips Group Sustainability, Business Continuity Management, Real Estate, Enterprise Risk Management, Insurance & Risk Management, Innovation & Strategy, Health and Safety and Group control. By embedding this risk assessment in existing processes and frameworks we have ensured alignment with the company’s strategy and financial plans. All Climate-related risks are a result of the DMA and maintained as part of the common risk view and considered in the Philips Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. As such Philips Executive Committee identifies, oversees, and manages the climate-related risks Philips faces in executing its strategy and its objectives. A Risk Management Support Team together with Philips Group Sustainability, consisting of several functional experts covering the various categories of enterprise risks, supports the Executive Committee through regular analysis of the climate-related risk- and opportunity profiles. Where needed assets and business activities at risk are addressed through climate mitigation or adaptation actions. To evaluate enterprise-wide risks (including climate risks), these are cascaded to the relevant target of evaluation, which are then expected to identify Philips risk exposure utilizing the Risk Assessment Number (RAN). This standardized metric, spanning from 1 to 125, allows all relevant stakeholders to uniformly compare diverse risks, irrespective of their varying risk drivers. The RAN is defined through three distinct variables. Namely, the likelihood of the risk materializing, the impact of the risk considering no control measures and lastly the control effectiveness of existing controls. Each of these variables are rated on a Likert scale from 1 to 5 by relevant subject matter experts. Physical Risk Assessment We assess physical risks through objective definition, risk exposure identification, vulnerability calculation, and impact analysis. The result of the risk assessment will constitute the basis for Philips’ adaptation actions. For more information on the underlying process and tooling used please refer to the Climate Resilience report that is available via the ESG download page. This risk assessment is limited to 24 of our sites that are considered critical for our business continuity. Critical suppliers have also been screened as part of the hot spot analysis but not yet integrated in our risk process. The following risks are assessed: drought, heat stress, wildfire, precipitation, river flood, tropical cyclones, cold stress, sea level rise and chronic risks. To evaluate Philips’ exposure to physical climate risks a two-step approach was employed. First, a hotspot analysis was conducted using the NATHAN tool to identify the expected future likelihood of risks becoming material. This initial analysis was enriched through site specific insights gathered through a workshop for relevant risks per site. This workshop engaged experts from Business Continuity Management, Plant Management, and Environmental and Financial Management for each in-scope site. These experts collaborated to assess the potential impact and the effectiveness of existing controls under a hypothetical worst-case scenario. This comprehensive assessment enabled us to quantitatively assess each site’s exposure to climate related perils. The resulting risk scores were aggregated at the company level.

"From an acute perspective results show that three sites require particular attention, namely Best, Reedsville and Pune. The site of Best (Netherlands, NUTS code: NL414) and Reedsville (US) face high-level risks across all time scales, primarily due to cold stress. According to NATHAN analysis, this risk is expected to decrease significantly in the future. The site of Pune (India) is projected to face high-level physical risks in the medium and long-term. Its exposure to precipitation and heat stress is expected to increase, alongside the consistently high risk of fire weather across all time scales. Additionally, sites in Alajuela (Costa Rica), Haifa (Israel), and Colorado Springs (US) are assessed to have medium-level risks in the foreseeable future predominately driven by heat stress and drought. From a chronic perspective results indicate that none of our sites are expected to be exposed to sea level rise and exposure to chronic shifts (e.g. change average temperatures) is also very limited. It is however important to note that there are a few sites in direct proximity to high-risk areas for sea level rise. This includes the Drachten site (Netherlands), Hamburg site (Germany), and Batam site (Indonesia). Philips has implemented robust control measures across our sites to address identified climate risks. Our risk analysis demonstrates comprehensive preparedness: among the 12 risks categorized as very high likelihood, all are controlled by measures with medium or higher effectiveness, with 83% controlled by high or very high effective measures. Similarly, for the 29 risks identified with high likelihood, 86% are managed through control measures of high or very high effectiveness. This data validates the strength and thoroughness of our risk adaptation strategy, confirming our operational resilience in the face of climate challenges. Transition Risk & Opportunity Assessment To ensure a smooth and gradual transition it is important for us to anticipate potential transition events and their impact on Philips’ operations. Conducting a transition risk/opportunity assessment therefore helps us navigate the rapidly evolving global market and regulatory landscape marked by sustainability imperatives. It also enables us to identify opportunities that we should capitalize on. Overall, through a stringent transition risk and opportunity assessment we are able to ensure the company stays compliant with upcoming regulations, adapts its business strategies, invest in sustainable technologies, minimize financial disruptions and proactively attract eco-conscious customers and investors. For more information on the methodology and results of the risk assessment please refer to the Climate Resilience report 2024. Please note that calculation methodologies, critical assumptions and scope of assessment are specific to each transition and explored below underneath each header. Upstream transition events It is expected that the prices for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions will rise in the future to incentivize the adoption of low-carbon technologies. This can be driven by mechanisms such as the Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) or carbon taxation. While we endorse this general policy direction, it comes with associated risks. From an upstream perspective, we expect that impacted suppliers will pass on the cost of carbon using the rates as defined by CE Delft (2021) per sector. The general assumption is that depending on the homogeneity of the product and elasticity of demand, some sectors are more inclined to pass on the cost of carbon downstream to their value chain partners (e.g. Philips). Most notably the EU-ETS is a cap-and-trade system that covers roughly 40% of all EU wide emissions. Sectors in scope are among others steel, iron, aluminum, paper and cardboard and glass. With the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) legislation in 2026, the scope of the EU ETS will expand to also include importers that currently reside outside the EU. For a preliminary estimation we have the below key assumptions: • We can decarbonize our Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and service in line with Philips’ transition plan. • Maximum carbon prices in accordance with the SSP1-1.9 scenario as derived by IIASA. • Only purchased goods and service-related emissions are of interest. For the short- and medium-term it was assumed that only high emitting industries, in alignment with the EU-ETS, will be directly impacted by carbon pricing (steel, iron, aluminum, glass, etc.). Carbon prices were therefore only applied to chemicals, glass, a subset of metals, and paper and cardboard. For the long-term it was then assumed that all materials regardless of their type will be impacted by carbon pricing. As response, we actively monitor the life cycle emissions of our purchased goods and steer our businesses towards sustainable product development through our EcoDesign and Circular Economy program. For more information, please refer to Resource use and circular economy. Operations transition events As Philips we have set a stringent long-term emission reduction target of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% until 2040 compared to the 2015 baseline. From a transition perspective we are therefore interested in identifying potential stranded assets, which are concretely planned sites, across the medium- and long-term with significant locked-in GHG emissions. Based on our internal investigations that included members from our integrated supply chain, Real estate and Group Sustainability, we have concluded that there are no expected stranded assets and no assets exposed to transition risks. This is based on the fact that in 2024 we have already reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% compared to 2015 meaning a target achievement rate of 95%. We are therefore well on track to achieving our long-term reduction targets. To manage our remaining energy and GHG intensive sites we monitor the emissions of our high impact sites monthly and together with Real estate are investigating novel ways to eliminate the usage of fossil fuels on site. All high impact sites are therefore under control and addressed by climate mitigation plans. From 2025 onwards a new KPI will also be introduced targeted at the CO2-e footprint of our sites.

"Please note that no carbon pricing scheme associated with our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (ETS, carbon tax, etc.) has a current material impact on our financial statements. Downstream transition events Under the given low global warming scenario, it is assumed that there is strong socio-economic drive to shift towards a low-carbon economy. With more than 60% of our full value chain emissions residing downstream during the use phase of our products this is our main exposure. This could include energy efficiency policies, market forces demanding energy efficiency improvements and consumer preferences that drive technological advancements. The rapid change could lead to a situation where Philips’ current technological capabilities lag behind those of our competitors and where the locked-in GHG emissions of our products inhibit our Scope 3 target achievement. For a more detailed overview of this risk please refer to our Climate Resilience report that is available via our ESG download page. To manage this risk, we continue our focus on energy efficiency, with Energy as one of four key focal areas of our EcoDesign program. All new product introductions are expected to optimize their energy efficiency. For more information on how EcoDesign can help our target achievement besides the transition towards renewable energy please refer to Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. For a quantitative assessment of our locked-in GHG emissions associated with our products please refer to Climate change and more specifically our emission associated with purchased goods and use of sold products. Resources allocated to climate change To strengthen our climate resilience from both adaptation and mitigation perspective and meet external commitments (e.g. Science Based Targets) we have allocated resources to reducing our environmental impact and preparing for potential acute and chronic climate related risks. Past and current resources Philips has allocated resources to enhance environmental resilience, including proceeds from the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework (April 24, 2019). These funds have been invested in Green and Sustainability Eligible Projects aligned with the objectives of: • Reducing value chain emissions (climate mitigation) • Building adaptive capacity (climate adaptation) All bonds issued under the Framework follow the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018, Social Bond Principles 2018 and the ICMA Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018, to ensure that the selected and disclosed projects meet widely recognized criteria. For more information, visit https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/debt.html. We have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For climate mitigation and adaptation, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 3 million (0.3%) of our EU Taxonomy aligned CapEx related to our actions to improve energy efficiency, phase out fossil fuels and build adaptive capacity on site. Refer to our EU Taxonomy disclosures for more. We have also invested EUR 263 million in Green Innovation in 2024 to support our efforts in reducing our biggest emissions contributors which are purchased goods and use of sold products. In total, our aforementioned expenditures cover these key actions related to our decarbonization levers: • Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase • Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives • Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain • Reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon • Transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites Future resources To ensure we meet our future climate targets and continue to build our adaptive capacity, it is important that future resources are allocated to our target achievement, such as: • Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency • Development of EcoDesigned new product introductions and partnerships • Infrastructure resilience, flood defense improvements, and climate-resilient, nature-based solutions The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies: Philips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three Scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two Scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our Scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total carbon footprint. As part of our carbon footprint, Philips also reports on five Scope 3 categories. These are indirect emissions that reside either upstream or downstream and are included in our approved Science Based Target of 42% reduction by 2030. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions These are direct emissions caused by company owned and -controlled entities. For example, the burning of fossil fuels and the use of refrigerants or chemicals on-site generates Scope 1-related CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. Sites report their consumption of refrigerants, and anthropogenic or biogenic-based fuels via our internal sustainability reporting system. Consumption per resource is then aggregated across all sites and multiplied by resource-specific emission factors. This approach is being used for all industrial sites and 80% of our non-industrial sites’ floor area. For all other sites, consumption is extrapolated. For Scope 1 emissions we use two sets of emission factors. For fossil fuels and natural gases, we use the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) database (v1.1 2023 – Global Warming Potentials (GWP) 5th Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 194"
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR)). For all other relevant Scope 1 refrigerants, we use the IPCC database (Either AR6, v1.2 or v1.5, or AR5, v1.2). Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions These are indirect emissions caused by the purchase of electricity, heating, steam, and cooling. These emissions are not generated on our sites but are still directly impacted by our consumption level and contractual agreements. We can therefore reduce these emissions by reducing consumption or by ensuring purchased energy comes from low-emission sources. We report on both market-based and location-based emissions. For the market-based approach, we first subtract the amount of renewable energy acquired or self-generated in a specific region from the actual amount of electricity consumed. All renewable electricity claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy market where the electricity-consuming operations are located, and is tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of Philips. To ensure ‘additionality’, all certificates were generated in 2024 – or maximum six months prior – in the market of consumption and are retired on behalf of Philips. The remainder can then be considered grey electricity, meaning a non- renewable source. We then multiply this by a residual mix emission factor. For more information on our renewable energy methodology please refer to the ESG download page. For the location-based approach, we examine energy purchases and disregard any renewable energy certificates acquired. This amount is then multiplied by grid-average emission factors. The grid emission factors used for the market-based approach are dependent on the location. For sites in the US, we apply the eGrid- specific Residual Mix emission factor (Green-e 2023 v1.1 (2021 Data)), and for sites in Europe we use the AIB European Residual Mixes (2022 v1.1). For all other countries, we apply the IEA emission factors because residual mix emission factors are non-existent for these regions (2023 v1.1 - GWP AR4, or 2022 v1.1 – GWP AR4). For the location-based approach we use eGrid and IEA grid average emission factors (Both v1.1 – GWP AR4). For all other energy purchases we use the emission factors from Bets (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5). Scope 3, category 1 – Purchased goods and services This includes any emissions generated by the consumption of raw materials, components, packaging, and services that are acquired to create and distribute Philips products. This is partially done in alignment with the Philips EP&L statement and only includes production-related goods (e.g., components and parts) and all services that fall under the GHG Protocol described category. Goods-related emissions are calculated using an average data method and services using a spend- based method. Components and material specific emission factors are determined using EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6). These factors are regularly updated and consider the sourcing as well as raw material processing. The impact of purchased services is in contrast based on an input-output model. To derive emissions the Exiobase database (v3.8.2 – GWP AR5 and AR6) is leveraged, which factors in all activities connected to the corresponding service. Scope 3, category 4 – Upstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting components, products, or raw materials from one location to another via a mode owned by a third party. This includes both upstream and mainstream (shipment between Philips facilities) related shipments and can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight, the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 6 – Business travel This covers any mode of transportation that is used by employees for business purposes and operated by a third party, excluding commuting. To calculate business travel emissions, we distinguish air travel and automobile travel. For automobile travel, we include leased vehicles and rented vehicles. All other modes of transportation are not considered due to their minimal usage for business purposes and negligible total impact (e.g., trains in the Netherlands run on renewable electricity). The emissions factors from BEIS (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5) are leveraged as these are updated annually. Scope 3, category 9 – Downstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting finished goods from a Philips facility or third- party warehouse to a customer via a mode owned by a third party. Please note that we are not always able to clearly distinguish shipments paid by Philips or by our customers, thereby slightly deviating from the GHGP. This can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 11 – Use of sold products To calculate the emissions generated during the use phase of our products we are interested in three key variables: the lifetime energy per device, number of products sold per country and country specific emission factors. It should be noted that the energy consumption during the full lifetime of the products sold is included in the emission calculation of the year of sale. To calculate emissions, the country grid average emission factors from EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6) are used. Only the direct energy need during use is accounted for (e.g., electricity to power our products). For more information on our emission and renewable energy calculation methodologies please refer to the ESG download page. This also includes a detailed analysis of the proportion of emissions calculated using primary data from our suppliers.

"Note II Resource use and circular economy For Philips, resource use and circular economy has, similar to climate change, been a material topic for many years, reconfirmed also by the DMA conducted in 2024. Our first circularity targets were established in the 1990s when we set recycling targets for our manufacturing sites. Since then, we have continued with waste related targets that build on established measurements in line with global waste standards. Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment. This was followed by another commitment in 2018 at Davos to ‘close the loop’ of our large medical equipment, recognizing the need to also take responsible care of them at their end-of-use. This chapter details Philips’ policies, targets, metrics, impacts, risks, opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition towards sustainable resource use and a circular economy. Policies, metrics and targets Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets Our circularity targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to maximize value with minimal consumption of virgin and non-renewable materials. Philips looks at circularity in its broadest sense, meaning that we do not only address the type and weight of the materials we use, but also, for example, dematerialization (e.g. through digitalization), efficiency (e.g., improving utilization), optimizing products-in-use (e.g. upgrades) and take-back of our products at end-of- use. The accompanying table shows how our 2025 circularity targets relate to increasing the circularity of our resource inflows and outflows while reducing waste. These targets also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use. Philips Group Philips 2025 targets linked to circularity of resource inflows and outflows KPIs Increase circular design Increase circular material use rate Minimize primary raw materials Increase sustainable sourcing of renewable materials Ensure waste management Circular revenues EcoDesigned NPIs EcoHero revenues Close the loop on medical equipment Zero waste to landfill Circular materials management Philips tracks progress on its 2025 targets as included in the next table, which also describes key actions to further deliver on these metrics. The progress toward accomplishing these targets is internally monitored on at least a quarterly basis, with quarterly progress externally reported for a selection of these via the Philips results hub.

"8.4 Environmental information Note I Climate change Climate change has been a material topic for Philips for many years, and the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) performed in 2024 re-confirmed this. It has also been a part of senior management remuneration as further explained in Remuneration report 2024. Building on our success in achieving carbon neutrality in 2020, this chapter details how Philips aligns its climate actions with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We will set out Philips’ policy, targets and metrics, material climate-related risks and opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition. Please note that Philips is not excluded from any EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks as we do not meet any of the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Policies, metrics and targets In this section, Philips’ Environmental policy, Science Based Targets and climate action scope will be further explored. For a more detailed overview of this please refer to the Climate Resilience report. Philips’ Policy and targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Our Climate Action targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to reduce our full value chain emissions and building Philips’ adaptive capacity. These targets therefore also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. Philips set its first science-based emission reduction targets back in 2017 for its Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions, officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, Philips has stepped-up and introduced new Science Based Targets, covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (approximately 96% of our value chain emissions). We are therefore committed to collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact and reduce our footprint across the value chain. Our Scope 3 target includes the following Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories: • Category 1: Purchased goods and services • Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution • Category 6: Business travel • Category 4: Downstream transportation and distribution • Category 11: Use of sold products All other Scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the GHG Protocol and CDP reporting requirements. Capital goods (Category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), waste generated in operations (Category 5), employee commuting (Category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. Additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (Category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (Category 10), franchises (Category 14), and investments (Category 15) are not applicable to Philips'. This approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. For all of our SBTi-approved and 1.5 °C-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. These targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the SBTi and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. Please note that we have also committed to Net Zero via SBTi and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. Philips Group Science Based Targets reduction % compared to baseline Scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA) emission reduction targets Scope 1 & 2 (Baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% Scope 3 (Baseline 2020) 95% -42% In accordance with the SBTi guidance, our site specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. During our baseline year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% Scope 1 emissions and 74% Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. In 2024, 89% of our target consisted of Scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. We have therefore decarbonized our Scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with Scope 1. All our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our Science Based Targets at Group level listed above. We do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. In establishing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. More precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. In particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives.

"Despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for Scope 3 stands out as a significant year for Philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. In contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative. Actions associated with climate change In this section Philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. This includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. This section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. Philips’ energy consumption and mix In 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. This was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. Most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. As such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. We have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. This is largely driven by multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) securing the supply of renewable electricity. Prior to 2023, these included the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. To further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in Europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in Mutkalampi, Finland and a solar farm in Pontinia, Italy. In December 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in China followed by a second one in December of 2024. For all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Details regarding the attributes per country are available through RE100. EACs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of RE100. These instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. By investing in renewable energy projects through the purchase of EACs, we not only contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector, but also directly limit our carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption. For more information on our renewable energy strategy please refer to the renewable energy methodology.

"Our total energy efficiency slightly declined by 2%, from 25.18 MWh/million EUR sales in 2023 to 25.78 MWh/million EUR sales in 2024. As noted, this is primarily due to increase office attendance. No capital expenditures have been made related to coal, oil or gas-related economic activities. There have also not been any site-related investments in 2024 with significant locked-in GHG emissions that might impede our renewable energy and/or emission-related targets. On the contrary, by signing new long-term Power Purchase Agreements, we have been able to secure the delivery of renewable energy for the future. Philips’ gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions We report on our full value chain emissions covering approximately 96% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Compared to 2023 we have not made any changes to this reporting scope ensuring comparability. The main adjustment compared with the previous year has been the splitting of upstream transportation and distribution from downstream transportation and distribution. This is further explained in Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution. Overall, we are well underway to achieving our Science Based Targets. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% meaning that for the achievement of our long-term 2040 target we will only have to reduce our emissions by 7 kilotonnes CO2-e. Additionally, we have reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 12% meaning that in the remaining 6 years we will only have to reduce emissions by 110 kilotonnes CO2-e. This excludes the use of any carbon credits (e.g., removal or reduction projects).

This is mainly due to the restructuring at Philips that required increased travel to allow for an optimal transition. The post- pandemic increase in travel was also driven by a need to align with customers which further contributed to the increased emissions. Moving forward, we continue to electrify our lease fleet and promote online collaboration, as well as increase our efforts to move travelers to rail transport for shorter distances. With tightened travel budgets in 2025, we aim to curb the growth of travel emissions.

The reduction in use-phase emissions can mainly be explained through reduced sales volume of energy-intensive products, and changes in the sales mix towards more energy efficient products. To reduce the impact of our sold products we are implementing energy efficiency measures for our existing and future installed base. This is closely tied to our EcoDesign commitment of having all new product introductions EcoDesigned by 2025. This is further explored under EcoDesign. We are also involved in novel partnerships with our customers to ensure reduced energy consumption and increased renewable energy usage of our devices. For more information on our partnerships please refer to Advocacy activities and expenses. Philips’ GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits Although reduction is key to achieving carbon neutrality, unavoidable carbon emissions require compensation. This is achieved by the cancellation of acquired carbon credits. In 2024, we offset a total of 474 kilotonnes CO2-e, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 14.2 million medium-sized oak trees. To plant all these trees an area of 512 million m2 would be required, equivalent to 9 times the area of Manhattan. This covers our operational carbon footprint, which includes all CO2-e emissions from our sites, business travel, and transportation and distribution. We thereby address climate change outside our own value chain and contribute to the reduction of global CO2-e emissions that we cannot eliminate along our own value chain. These activities complement our existing climate strategy and are excluded from our Science Based Targets for emission reductions. Thus, ensuring that these investments do not impede the achievement of our carbon reduction targets. Philips not only offsets its operational carbon footprint by funding impactful social and environmental projects but is also proactively exploring innovative approaches to directly reduce carbon emissions in its value chain, particularly for unavoidable transport-related emissions. Although we did not use any biofuels in 2024, we do believe this is a potential lever that can help us reduce our carbon footprint in the future. For future reference we only accept biofuels from wastes, residues and by-products as feedstocks with preference for REDII Annex IX feedstocks for advanced biofuels. This strategic move not only resulted in a modest reduction of emissions, but also aligns with our commitment to nature-based solutions.

"We finance projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 12. To ensure these offsets meet our high-quality standard of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting, Philips only procures carbon credits from carbon standards that are endorsed by ICROA, such as VCS Standard and Gold Standard. Each program is also verified by an independent third party. We ensure, through our providers, that the quality criteria of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting are met. In addition, Philips has conducted site visits to some of the projects in our portfolio. None of our credits as of now are subject to corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Philips will follow the developments of Article 6 closely to understand if, and when, any of the projects might become subject to corresponding adjustments. Please note that all removal credits are associated with biogenic sinks and linked to activities outside Philips value chain. All our carbon offsets drive social, economic and environmental progress in emerging markets. In 2024 we did not retire any carbon credits from removal projects. Our projects include: Restoring ecosystems and empowering communities through tree planting In Kenya, subsistence farmers are supported to plant and maintain trees on their land through the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST). This carbon removal project enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and strengthens community resilience, providing co-benefits beyond carbon sequestration. Farmers retain ownership of the trees and their products, receiving training and a share of carbon revenues. As an Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiative, it is a nature-based solution contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard with the CCB label. Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption This carbon-emission reduction project is expected to provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. As such, this contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Protecting forests through sustainable production Deforestation is expected to be reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. Unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced, thereby contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. The forest supports the supply of water to other parts of Ethiopia and neighboring countries. It is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy In India, the energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation. This is therefore considered a technological solution that also enables an improvement in livelihoods. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Improving respiratory health and reducing deforestation through provision of clean cookstoves By supporting a range of cookstove technologies across Ghana and Kenya, the projects improve respiratory health, reduce fuel costs and reduce deforestation. As such, this project contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. This also gives people more time for paid work, thus improving prospects. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Philips’ internal carbon pricing At Philips, we apply an internal carbon shadow discount price for our IT, Real Estate, Businesses and R&D investments. If an investment may support our climate targets by reducing CO2-e emissions, the relevant Function and/or Business is encouraged to apply EUR 150 discount per saved tonne CO2-e. This enables all Functions and Businesses to incorporate climate impacts in their business case development. Furthermore, by using a discount we proactively incentivize the pursuit of sustainable projects, rather than imposing penalties on unsustainable investments. The scope spans all Philips operations and includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as all the material Scope 3 categories. There are no geographic or business-specific boundaries. This therefore covers 100% of our Scope 1 & 2 targets and approximately 95% of our gross Scope 3 emissions (96% of overall emissions). The price of EUR 150 per metric ton CO2-e is derived from the internationally recognized ReCiPe methodology, in combination with the environmental pricing provided by CE Delft. The price is also validated by an external body other than our assurance provider, namely KPMG and set in alignment with our EP&L statement. The key assumption is that the price of carbon will increase in the future. Therefore, to ensure price stability over the coming years, an uplift was applied to the price of carbon, identified by CE Delft. Please note that the internal carbon pricing is not considered in the financial statements as the assumptions in the financial statements are based on (external) market assumptions.

"please refer to the Climate Resilience report 2024 that can be found via our ESG download page. Most importantly our definitions for the short-, medium-, and long-term diverge from our central definition prescribed by the ESRS. This was done in consultation with other departments, to ensure perpetual business continuity and acknowledge the fact that climate related risks and opportunities generally materialize beyond a 5-year time horizon. It also accounts for the time horizons linked to our commitments.

This aligns and is embedded in our business strategy as well as financial planning. To achieve this, we focus on the following core objectives, prioritized by their potential impact. Further details on underlying assumptions are available in our Climate Resilience report, which has been approved by our administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase Since most of our climate impact occurs downstream during the use-phase of our products, we are dedicated to designing energy-efficient solutions and supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. All new product introductions adhere to our EcoDesign requirements, where energy efficiency is a key focus. This approach allows us to engineer a product portfolio optimized for energy consumption during use, which not only reduces our environmental footprint but also helps our customers lower their operational costs. Moreover, the adoption of renewable energy by our customers, also supports our use phase decarbonization by eliminating CO2-e emissions during the energy generation. We therefore actively support and encourage our customers in their transition to renewables (see Champalimaud case). Our key assumption is that electrical grids will decarbonize in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Stated Policy Scenario (SPS) or Announced Pledge Scenario (APS). Based on preliminary estimates, we expect to reduce our use phase (GHGP category 11) carbon footprint as follows: Philips Group Expected use-phase emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 2,529 2,797 – 2,330 1,590 – 98 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 2,631 2,363 – 2,829 3,570 – 5,062 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 51% 46% - 55% 69% - 98% Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives From a climate perspective, applying circular business models has the potential for significant emission reductions. By retaining materials’ value, we reduce the need for virgin resources and the energy required to produce them, resulting in lower emissions. This approach is led by our Circular Economy team through the principles of ‘use less, use longer, and use again’, which also includes our ambition of ‘closing the loop’. Circular design is one of the key focal areas of EcoDesign, which includes for example design for low weight, which reduces the need for material extraction and thereby contributes to emission reductions. It also includes designing with sustainable materials (recycled, biobased, etc.), which often require less energy to process, cutting down greenhouse gases in the sourcing and manufacturing phase. For our Personal Health segment, for example, this includes replacing virgin plastic packaging with paper-based alternatives or increasing the recycled content of the materials we use. Next, we focus on increasing circular practices at our sites and responsible waste management according to the waste hierarchy. As such we actively monitor the waste management of our industrial sites with the aim of retaining the value of materials. This is further explained in Sustainable Operations. Lastly, we initiated the process to focus on responsibly reusing products and parts at the end of their use. Among other things, this includes refurbishment, and responsible takeback. By recirculating products, parts and materials, we increase the market for used products and ensure materials are longer in use. Altogether we believe that by applying our circularity principles, we will be able to reduce our purchased goods emissions (GHGP category 1) by: Philips Group Expected purchased goods emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 904 1,023 – 872 812 – 148 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 275 156 – 307 367 – 1,031 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 23% 13% - 26% 31% - 87% Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 189"

"Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain There is a pressing need for industry and business to manage and reduce CO2-e emissions across the entire value chain – including at supplier level. To this end, we have invited many of our largest suppliers to report their climate performance and strategy as part of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain program. Additionally, we engage with these suppliers to reduce their emissions as part of our Supplier Sustainability program. By engaging with suppliers, encouraging them to set Science Based targets and supporting their decarbonization efforts we believe we will be able to amplify our impact. We acknowledge our dependency on suppliers’ decarbonization in achieving our climate ambitions and will continue our focus on driving impact throughout the value chain. To that end, we expect that by further engaging with our suppliers through our Supplier Sustainability program we are able to reduce our purchased services emissions as follows (GHGP category 1): Philips Group Expected purchased services emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 492 442 – 388 334 – 308 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 44 95 – 149 203 – 229 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 8% 18% - 28% 38% - 43% Reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon We are committed to minimizing the CO2-e impact of our logistics operations by working closely with our logistics partners and transportation providers. To this end, we have initiated collaborations with our key logistics suppliers to transition to low-emission vehicle fleets, increase fuel efficiency, and optimize route planning. We actively engage with all partners (both internal and external) through our Sustainable Logistics program, which aims to identify further opportunities for emission reductions, including alternative fuel options and innovative, lower-emission transport modes. Key decarbonization levers are correspondingly: reducing the need for shipments, shifting air to ocean, reducing shipment chargeable weight in line with our EcoDesign strategy and transitioning to alternative fuels (e.g. electric or biofuel). To that end we expect to reduce our logistic emissions (GHGP categories 4 and 9) as follows: Philips Group Expected upstream and downstream logistics emissions reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 338 275 – 200 239 – 67 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 77 140 – 215 176 – 348 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 18% 34% - 52% 42% - 84% Transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites By continuing to phase-out fossil fuels at our sites and increase our global renewable energy share, we will be able to achieve our long-term emission targets (GHGP Scope 1 and 2). The main lever to transition to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites is by reducing our natural gas consumption. We are aiming to significantly reduce our natural gas consumption by for example moving towards geothermal and renewable district heating and cooling solutions as well as exploring the option of switching towards biofuels. As such we expect to decarbonize our sites as follows: Philips Group Expected Scope 1 and 2 emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 20 19 – 13 13 – 1 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 124 116 – 121 121 – 134 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 84% 86% - 90% 90% - 99% Philips Group Climate Transition plan 2024 Emission reductions are linked to performance bonuses through for example the Long-term Incentive (LTI) program. As mentioned previously we have also included carbon pricing as standard measure in our corporate saving and investment tooling highlighting our climate change governance and embeddedness.

"8.4 Environmental information Note I Climate change Climate change has been a material topic for Philips for many years, and the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) performed in 2024 re-confirmed this. It has also been a part of senior management remuneration as further explained in Remuneration report 2024. Building on our success in achieving carbon neutrality in 2020, this chapter details how Philips aligns its climate actions with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We will set out Philips’ policy, targets and metrics, material climate-related risks and opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition. Please note that Philips is not excluded from any EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks as we do not meet any of the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Policies, metrics and targets In this section, Philips’ Environmental policy, Science Based Targets and climate action scope will be further explored. For a more detailed overview of this please refer to the Climate Resilience report. Philips’ Policy and targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Our Climate Action targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to reduce our full value chain emissions and building Philips’ adaptive capacity. These targets therefore also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. Philips set its first science-based emission reduction targets back in 2017 for its Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions, officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, Philips has stepped-up and introduced new Science Based Targets, covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (approximately 96% of our value chain emissions). We are therefore committed to collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact and reduce our footprint across the value chain. Our Scope 3 target includes the following Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories: • Category 1: Purchased goods and services • Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution • Category 6: Business travel • Category 4: Downstream transportation and distribution • Category 11: Use of sold products All other Scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the GHG Protocol and CDP reporting requirements. Capital goods (Category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), waste generated in operations (Category 5), employee commuting (Category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. Additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (Category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (Category 10), franchises (Category 14), and investments (Category 15) are not applicable to Philips'. This approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. For all of our SBTi-approved and 1.5 °C-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. These targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the SBTi and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. Please note that we have also committed to Net Zero via SBTi and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. Philips Group Science Based Targets reduction % compared to baseline Scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA) emission reduction targets Scope 1 & 2 (Baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% Scope 3 (Baseline 2020) 95% -42% In accordance with the SBTi guidance, our site specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. During our baseline year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% Scope 1 emissions and 74% Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. In 2024, 89% of our target consisted of Scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. We have therefore decarbonized our Scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with Scope 1. All our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our Science Based Targets at Group level listed above. We do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. In establishing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. More precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. In particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives.

"Despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for Scope 3 stands out as a significant year for Philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. In contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative. Actions associated with climate change In this section Philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. This includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. This section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. Philips’ energy consumption and mix In 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. This was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. Most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. As such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. We have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. This is largely driven by multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) securing the supply of renewable electricity. Prior to 2023, these included the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. To further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in Europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in Mutkalampi, Finland and a solar farm in Pontinia, Italy. In December 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in China followed by a second one in December of 2024. For all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Details regarding the attributes per country are available through RE100. EACs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of RE100. These instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility.

"Our total energy efficiency slightly declined by 2%, from 25.18 MWh/million EUR sales in 2023 to 25.78 MWh/million EUR sales in 2024. As noted, this is primarily due to increase office attendance. No capital expenditures have been made related to coal, oil or gas-related economic activities. There have also not been any site-related investments in 2024 with significant locked-in GHG emissions that might impede our renewable energy and/or emission-related targets. On the contrary, by signing new long-term Power Purchase Agreements, we have been able to secure the delivery of renewable energy for the future. Philips’ gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions We report on our full value chain emissions covering approximately 96% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Compared to 2023 we have not made any changes to this reporting scope ensuring comparability. The main adjustment compared with the previous year has been the splitting of upstream transportation and distribution from downstream transportation and distribution. This is further explained in Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution. Overall, we are well underway to achieving our Science Based Targets. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% meaning that for the achievement of our long-term 2040 target we will only have to reduce our emissions by 7 kilotonnes CO2-e. Additionally, we have reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 12% meaning that in the remaining 6 years we will only have to reduce emissions by 110 kilotonnes CO2-e. This excludes the use of any carbon credits (e.g., removal or reduction projects).

"Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions At our sites, we reduced our Scope 1 (direct) CO2-e emissions by 10% and increased our Scope 2 (market-based approach) CO2-e emissions by 1% compared to 2023. Scope 1 emissions include the emissions from direct fuel consumption and refrigerant use, while Scope 2 (market-based) emissions cover non-renewable electricity and purchased (city/district) heating, cooling, and steam. In line with our environmental policy, we are actively implementing energy efficiency measures, phasing out fossil fuels, and procuring renewable electricity to meet our Science Based Targets for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This commitment is further underscored by our pursuit of ISO 50001 certification for our manufacturing sites, enabling a systematic approach to continuous energy management improvements. For more information on our energy performance please refer to Philips’ energy consumption and mix. Although we have already achieved our 2025 SBTi targets, we are committed to accelerating our Scope 1 and 2 decarbonization efforts by reducing overall energy consumption and sourcing alternative renewable energy solutions. This ensures we remain on track to meet our long-term 2040 Science Based Target. As part of our reporting obligations, we are also committed to disclosing emissions per greenhouse gas type, where available. We do this for our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as these are under our direct operational control. Knowing which greenhouse gases contribute the most to our footprint allows us to scrutinize the underlying processes and if needed take corrective actions. In accordance with international reporting requirements, emissions from each of the gases are weighted by their Global Warming Potential (GWP), so that total Greenhouse Gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis. For an overview of the respective GWPs per fuel please refer to Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies.

This is a reduction of 19% compared to the 2020 baseline and a 8% reduction compared to 2023. The main reason for this reduction is the reduced sales volume of Philips in 2024 vs 2023 and the shift in our product portfolio reducing the per unit purchased goods emissions. To further reduce these emissions towards our 2030 SBTi target and Net Zero commitment, we are driving action through our Circular Economy and EcoDesign programs, applying the principles ’use less, use longer and use again’. For more information on our actions associated with the Circular Economy program please refer to Resource use and circular economy. For more information on how we are planning to decarbonize our purchased goods and service emissions in the future please refer to Philips’ transition plan. We also announced at COP26 our plan to step up our acclaimed Supplier Sustainability program with the goal of having at least 50% of our suppliers (based on spend) committing to Science Based Targets for CO2-e emissions reduction by 2025. This will help amplify our impact reducing emissions across the supply chain. For more information please refer to Supplier sustainability & Workers in the value chain. Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution In 2024, we split our upstream transportation and distribution emissions from our downstream transportation and distribution. This adds a level of granularity to our report that we were not able to provide in previous years. To ensure comparability across the years we have decided to use the same proportionate split between upstream and downstream for all historic years up to our baseline year 2020. This change has therefore not impacted our total value chain emissions but merely added more granularity. Overall, we recorded an increase of 11% in our emissions from our Transportation and Distribution compared to 2023. The reason for this increase is primarily driven by the updated BEIS emission factors that have increased by 20% compared to our 2023 emission factors (for long haul flights). This is a variable that we are not able to influence and therefore out of our control. Looking at the variables we are able to influence, we have successfully reduced our total number of air freight shipments by 2% which has mitigated the increase in emission factors. This reduction in air freight shipments can be associated with several business specific projects. These among others include the Magnet by Ocean project, where we shifted several up- and downstream lanes from air freight to ocean freight, and the shipment consolidation project, where we group multiple shipments in one to reduce the total number of shipments. It is also important to note that Philips was the first healthcare company to sign the coZEV ambition statement for Sustainable Maritime Freight Shipping. This will support our efforts in accelerating maritime decarbonization.

"8.4 Environmental information Note I Climate change Climate change has been a material topic for Philips for many years, and the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) performed in 2024 re-confirmed this. It has also been a part of senior management remuneration as further explained in Remuneration report 2024. Building on our success in achieving carbon neutrality in 2020, this chapter details how Philips aligns its climate actions with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). We will set out Philips’ policy, targets and metrics, material climate-related risks and opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition. Please note that Philips is not excluded from any EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks as we do not meet any of the exclusion criteria stated in Article 12.1 (d) to (g) of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818. Policies, metrics and targets In this section, Philips’ Environmental policy, Science Based Targets and climate action scope will be further explored. For a more detailed overview of this please refer to the Climate Resilience report. Philips’ Policy and targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Our Climate Action targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to reduce our full value chain emissions and building Philips’ adaptive capacity. These targets therefore also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. Philips set its first science-based emission reduction targets back in 2017 for its Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions, officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In 2022, Philips has stepped-up and introduced new Science Based Targets, covering Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (approximately 96% of our value chain emissions). We are therefore committed to collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact and reduce our footprint across the value chain. Our Scope 3 target includes the following Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories: • Category 1: Purchased goods and services • Category 4: Upstream transportation and distribution • Category 6: Business travel • Category 4: Downstream transportation and distribution • Category 11: Use of sold products All other Scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the GHG Protocol and CDP reporting requirements. Capital goods (Category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (Category 3), waste generated in operations (Category 5), employee commuting (Category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (Category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. Additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (Category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (Category 10), franchises (Category 14), and investments (Category 15) are not applicable to Philips'. This approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. For all of our SBTi-approved and 1.5 °C-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. These targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the SBTi and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. Please note that we have also committed to Net Zero via SBTi and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. Philips Group Science Based Targets reduction % compared to baseline Scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 Absolute Contraction Approach (ACA) emission reduction targets Scope 1 & 2 (Baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% Scope 3 (Baseline 2020) 95% -42% In accordance with the SBTi guidance, our site specific direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. During our baseline year, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% Scope 1 emissions and 74% Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. In 2024, 89% of our target consisted of Scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. We have therefore decarbonized our Scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with Scope 1. All our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our Science Based Targets at Group level listed above. We do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. In establishing our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. More precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. In particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives.

"Despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for Scope 3 stands out as a significant year for Philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. In contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for Scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative. Actions associated with climate change In this section Philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. This includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. This section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. Philips’ energy consumption and mix In 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. This was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. Most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. As such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. We have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. This is largely driven by multiple Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) securing the supply of renewable electricity. Prior to 2023, these included the Los Mirasoles wind farm in the US and the Krammer and Bouwdokken wind farms in the Dutch province of Zeeland. To further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in Europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in Mutkalampi, Finland and a solar farm in Pontinia, Italy. In December 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in China followed by a second one in December of 2024. For all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). Details regarding the attributes per country are available through RE100. EACs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of RE100. These instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. By investing in renewable energy projects through the purchase of EACs, we not only contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector, but also directly limit our carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption.

Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution In 2024, we split our upstream transportation and distribution emissions from our downstream transportation and distribution. This adds a level of granularity to our report that we were not able to provide in previous years. To ensure comparability across the years we have decided to use the same proportionate split between upstream and downstream for all historic years up to our baseline year 2020. This change has therefore not impacted our total value chain emissions but merely added more granularity. Overall, we recorded an increase of 11% in our emissions from our Transportation and Distribution compared to 2023. The reason for this increase is primarily driven by the updated BEIS emission factors that have increased by 20% compared to our 2023 emission factors (for long haul flights). This is a variable that we are not able to influence and therefore out of our control. Looking at the variables we are able to influence, we have successfully reduced our total number of air freight shipments by 2% which has mitigated the increase in emission factors. This reduction in air freight shipments can be associated with several business specific projects. These among others include the Magnet by Ocean project, where we shifted several up- and downstream lanes from air freight to ocean freight, and the shipment consolidation project, where we group multiple shipments in one to reduce the total number of shipments. It is also important to note that Philips was the first healthcare company to sign the coZEV ambition statement for Sustainable Maritime Freight Shipping. This will support our efforts in accelerating maritime decarbonization.

This is mainly due to the restructuring at Philips that required increased travel to allow for an optimal transition. The post- pandemic increase in travel was also driven by a need to align with customers which further contributed to the increased emissions. Moving forward, we continue to electrify our lease fleet and promote online collaboration, as well as increase our efforts to move travelers to rail transport for shorter distances. With tightened travel budgets in 2025, we aim to curb the growth of travel emissions.

The reduction in use-phase emissions can mainly be explained through reduced sales volume of energy-intensive products, and changes in the sales mix towards more energy efficient products. To reduce the impact of our sold products we are implementing energy efficiency measures for our existing and future installed base. This is closely tied to our EcoDesign commitment of having all new product introductions EcoDesigned by 2025. This is further explored under EcoDesign. We are also involved in novel partnerships with our customers to ensure reduced energy consumption and increased renewable energy usage of our devices. For more information on our partnerships please refer to Advocacy activities and expenses. Philips’ GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits Although reduction is key to achieving carbon neutrality, unavoidable carbon emissions require compensation. This is achieved by the cancellation of acquired carbon credits. In 2024, we offset a total of 474 kilotonnes CO2-e, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 14.2 million medium-sized oak trees. To plant all these trees an area of 512 million m2 would be required, equivalent to 9 times the area of Manhattan. This covers our operational carbon footprint, which includes all CO2-e emissions from our sites, business travel, and transportation and distribution. We thereby address climate change outside our own value chain and contribute to the reduction of global CO2-e emissions that we cannot eliminate along our own value chain. These activities complement our existing climate strategy and are excluded from our Science Based Targets for emission reductions. Thus, ensuring that these investments do not impede the achievement of our carbon reduction targets. Philips not only offsets its operational carbon footprint by funding impactful social and environmental projects but is also proactively exploring innovative approaches to directly reduce carbon emissions in its value chain, particularly for unavoidable transport-related emissions. Although we did not use any biofuels in 2024, we do believe this is a potential lever that can help us reduce our carbon footprint in the future. For future reference we only accept biofuels from wastes, residues and by-products as feedstocks with preference for REDII Annex IX feedstocks for advanced biofuels. This strategic move not only resulted in a modest reduction of emissions, but also aligns with our commitment to nature-based solutions.

"Our total energy efficiency slightly declined by 2%, from 25.18 MWh/million EUR sales in 2023 to 25.78 MWh/million EUR sales in 2024. As noted, this is primarily due to increase office attendance. No capital expenditures have been made related to coal, oil or gas-related economic activities. There have also not been any site-related investments in 2024 with significant locked-in GHG emissions that might impede our renewable energy and/or emission-related targets. On the contrary, by signing new long-term Power Purchase Agreements, we have been able to secure the delivery of renewable energy for the future. Philips’ gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions We report on our full value chain emissions covering approximately 96% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Compared to 2023 we have not made any changes to this reporting scope ensuring comparability. The main adjustment compared with the previous year has been the splitting of upstream transportation and distribution from downstream transportation and distribution. This is further explained in Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution. Overall, we are well underway to achieving our Science Based Targets. We have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 85% meaning that for the achievement of our long-term 2040 target we will only have to reduce our emissions by 7 kilotonnes CO2-e. Additionally, we have reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 12% meaning that in the remaining 6 years we will only have to reduce emissions by 110 kilotonnes CO2-e. This excludes the use of any carbon credits (e.g., removal or reduction projects).

"Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions At our sites, we reduced our Scope 1 (direct) CO2-e emissions by 10% and increased our Scope 2 (market-based approach) CO2-e emissions by 1% compared to 2023. Scope 1 emissions include the emissions from direct fuel consumption and refrigerant use, while Scope 2 (market-based) emissions cover non-renewable electricity and purchased (city/district) heating, cooling, and steam. In line with our environmental policy, we are actively implementing energy efficiency measures, phasing out fossil fuels, and procuring renewable electricity to meet our Science Based Targets for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This commitment is further underscored by our pursuit of ISO 50001 certification for our manufacturing sites, enabling a systematic approach to continuous energy management improvements. For more information on our energy performance please refer to Philips’ energy consumption and mix. Although we have already achieved our 2025 SBTi targets, we are committed to accelerating our Scope 1 and 2 decarbonization efforts by reducing overall energy consumption and sourcing alternative renewable energy solutions. This ensures we remain on track to meet our long-term 2040 Science Based Target. As part of our reporting obligations, we are also committed to disclosing emissions per greenhouse gas type, where available. We do this for our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as these are under our direct operational control. Knowing which greenhouse gases contribute the most to our footprint allows us to scrutinize the underlying processes and if needed take corrective actions. In accordance with international reporting requirements, emissions from each of the gases are weighted by their Global Warming Potential (GWP), so that total Greenhouse Gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis.

This is a reduction of 19% compared to the 2020 baseline and a 8% reduction compared to 2023. The main reason for this reduction is the reduced sales volume of Philips in 2024 vs 2023 and the shift in our product portfolio reducing the per unit purchased goods emissions. To further reduce these emissions towards our 2030 SBTi target and Net Zero commitment, we are driving action through our Circular Economy and EcoDesign programs, applying the principles ’use less, use longer and use again’. For more information on our actions associated with the Circular Economy program please refer to Resource use and circular economy.

"We finance projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 12. To ensure these offsets meet our high-quality standard of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting, Philips only procures carbon credits from carbon standards that are endorsed by ICROA, such as VCS Standard and Gold Standard. Each program is also verified by an independent third party. We ensure, through our providers, that the quality criteria of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting are met. In addition, Philips has conducted site visits to some of the projects in our portfolio. None of our credits as of now are subject to corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Philips will follow the developments of Article 6 closely to understand if, and when, any of the projects might become subject to corresponding adjustments. Please note that all removal credits are associated with biogenic sinks and linked to activities outside Philips value chain. All our carbon offsets drive social, economic and environmental progress in emerging markets. In 2024 we did not retire any carbon credits from removal projects. Our projects include: Restoring ecosystems and empowering communities through tree planting In Kenya, subsistence farmers are supported to plant and maintain trees on their land through the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST). This carbon removal project enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and strengthens community resilience, providing co-benefits beyond carbon sequestration. Farmers retain ownership of the trees and their products, receiving training and a share of carbon revenues. As an Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiative, it is a nature-based solution contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard with the CCB label. Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption This carbon-emission reduction project is expected to provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. As such, this contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Protecting forests through sustainable production Deforestation is expected to be reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. Unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced, thereby contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. The forest supports the supply of water to other parts of Ethiopia and neighboring countries. It is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy In India, the energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation. This is therefore considered a technological solution that also enables an improvement in livelihoods. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Improving respiratory health and reducing deforestation through provision of clean cookstoves By supporting a range of cookstove technologies across Ghana and Kenya, the projects improve respiratory health, reduce fuel costs and reduce deforestation. As such, this project contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. This also gives people more time for paid work, thus improving prospects. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Philips’ internal carbon pricing At Philips, we apply an internal carbon shadow discount price for our IT, Real Estate, Businesses and R&D investments. If an investment may support our climate targets by reducing CO2-e emissions, the relevant Function and/or Business is encouraged to apply EUR 150 discount per saved tonne CO2-e. This enables all Functions and Businesses to incorporate climate impacts in their business case development. Furthermore, by using a discount we proactively incentivize the pursuit of sustainable projects, rather than imposing penalties on unsustainable investments. The scope spans all Philips operations and includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as all the material Scope 3 categories. There are no geographic or business-specific boundaries. This therefore covers 100% of our Scope 1 & 2 targets and approximately 95% of our gross Scope 3 emissions (96% of overall emissions). The price of EUR 150 per metric ton CO2-e is derived from the internationally recognized ReCiPe methodology, in combination with the environmental pricing provided by CE Delft. The price is also validated by an external body other than our assurance provider, namely KPMG and set in alignment with our EP&L statement. The key assumption is that the price of carbon will increase in the future. Therefore, to ensure price stability over the coming years, an uplift was applied to the price of carbon, identified by CE Delft. Please note that the internal carbon pricing is not considered in the financial statements as the assumptions in the financial statements are based on (external) market assumptions.

Most importantly our definitions for the short-, medium-, and long-term diverge from our central definition prescribed by the ESRS. This was done in consultation with other departments, to ensure perpetual business continuity and acknowledge the fact that climate related risks and opportunities generally materialize beyond a 5-year time horizon. It also accounts for the time horizons linked to our commitments.

This aligns and is embedded in our business strategy as well as financial planning. To achieve this, we focus on the following core objectives, prioritized by their potential impact. Further details on underlying assumptions are available in our Climate Resilience report, which has been approved by our administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase Since most of our climate impact occurs downstream during the use-phase of our products, we are dedicated to designing energy-efficient solutions and supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. All new product introductions adhere to our EcoDesign requirements, where energy efficiency is a key focus. This approach allows us to engineer a product portfolio optimized for energy consumption during use, which not only reduces our environmental footprint but also helps our customers lower their operational costs. Moreover, the adoption of renewable energy by our customers, also supports our use phase decarbonization by eliminating CO2-e emissions during the energy generation. We therefore actively support and encourage our customers in their transition to renewables (see Champalimaud case). Our key assumption is that electrical grids will decarbonize in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Stated Policy Scenario (SPS) or Announced Pledge Scenario (APS). Based on preliminary estimates, we expect to reduce our use phase (GHGP category 11) carbon footprint as follows: Philips Group Expected use-phase emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 2,529 2,797 – 2,330 1,590 – 98 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 2,631 2,363 – 2,829 3,570 – 5,062 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 51% 46% - 55% 69% - 98% Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives From a climate perspective, applying circular business models has the potential for significant emission reductions. By retaining materials’ value, we reduce the need for virgin resources and the energy required to produce them, resulting in lower emissions. This approach is led by our Circular Economy team through the principles of ‘use less, use longer, and use again’, which also includes our ambition of ‘closing the loop’. Circular design is one of the key focal areas of EcoDesign, which includes for example design for low weight, which reduces the need for material extraction and thereby contributes to emission reductions. It also includes designing with sustainable materials (recycled, biobased, etc.), which often require less energy to process, cutting down greenhouse gases in the sourcing and manufacturing phase. For our Personal Health segment, for example, this includes replacing virgin plastic packaging with paper-based alternatives or increasing the recycled content of the materials we use. Next, we focus on increasing circular practices at our sites and responsible waste management according to the waste hierarchy. As such we actively monitor the waste management of our industrial sites with the aim of retaining the value of materials. This is further explained in Sustainable Operations. Lastly, we initiated the process to focus on responsibly reusing products and parts at the end of their use. Among other things, this includes refurbishment, and responsible takeback. By recirculating products, parts and materials, we increase the market for used products and ensure materials are longer in use.

"Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions At our sites, we reduced our Scope 1 (direct) CO2-e emissions by 10% and increased our Scope 2 (market-based approach) CO2-e emissions by 1% compared to 2023. Scope 1 emissions include the emissions from direct fuel consumption and refrigerant use, while Scope 2 (market-based) emissions cover non-renewable electricity and purchased (city/district) heating, cooling, and steam. In line with our environmental policy, we are actively implementing energy efficiency measures, phasing out fossil fuels, and procuring renewable electricity to meet our Science Based Targets for Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions in line with limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This commitment is further underscored by our pursuit of ISO 50001 certification for our manufacturing sites, enabling a systematic approach to continuous energy management improvements. For more information on our energy performance please refer to Philips’ energy consumption and mix. Although we have already achieved our 2025 SBTi targets, we are committed to accelerating our Scope 1 and 2 decarbonization efforts by reducing overall energy consumption and sourcing alternative renewable energy solutions. This ensures we remain on track to meet our long-term 2040 Science Based Target. As part of our reporting obligations, we are also committed to disclosing emissions per greenhouse gas type, where available. We do this for our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as these are under our direct operational control. Knowing which greenhouse gases contribute the most to our footprint allows us to scrutinize the underlying processes and if needed take corrective actions. In accordance with international reporting requirements, emissions from each of the gases are weighted by their Global Warming Potential (GWP), so that total Greenhouse Gas emissions can be reported on a consistent basis. For an overview of the respective GWPs per fuel please refer to Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies.

This is a reduction of 19% compared to the 2020 baseline and a 8% reduction compared to 2023. The main reason for this reduction is the reduced sales volume of Philips in 2024 vs 2023 and the shift in our product portfolio reducing the per unit purchased goods emissions. To further reduce these emissions towards our 2030 SBTi target and Net Zero commitment, we are driving action through our Circular Economy and EcoDesign programs, applying the principles ’use less, use longer and use again’. For more information on our actions associated with the Circular Economy program please refer to Resource use and circular economy. For more information on how we are planning to decarbonize our purchased goods and service emissions in the future please refer to Philips’ transition plan. We also announced at COP26 our plan to step up our acclaimed Supplier Sustainability program with the goal of having at least 50% of our suppliers (based on spend) committing to Science Based Targets for CO2-e emissions reduction by 2025. This will help amplify our impact reducing emissions across the supply chain. For more information please refer to Supplier sustainability & Workers in the value chain. Scope 3, Category 4 & 9 - Transportation and Distribution In 2024, we split our upstream transportation and distribution emissions from our downstream transportation and distribution. This adds a level of granularity to our report that we were not able to provide in previous years. To ensure comparability across the years we have decided to use the same proportionate split between upstream and downstream for all historic years up to our baseline year 2020. This change has therefore not impacted our total value chain emissions but merely added more granularity. Overall, we recorded an increase of 11% in our emissions from our Transportation and Distribution compared to 2023. The reason for this increase is primarily driven by the updated BEIS emission factors that have increased by 20% compared to our 2023 emission factors (for long haul flights). This is a variable that we are not able to influence and therefore out of our control. Looking at the variables we are able to influence, we have successfully reduced our total number of air freight shipments by 2% which has mitigated the increase in emission factors. This reduction in air freight shipments can be associated with several business specific projects. These among others include the Magnet by Ocean project, where we shifted several up- and downstream lanes from air freight to ocean freight, and the shipment consolidation project, where we group multiple shipments in one to reduce the total number of shipments. It is also important to note that Philips was the first healthcare company to sign the coZEV ambition statement for Sustainable Maritime Freight Shipping. This will support our efforts in accelerating maritime decarbonization.

This is mainly due to the restructuring at Philips that required increased travel to allow for an optimal transition. The post- pandemic increase in travel was also driven by a need to align with customers which further contributed to the increased emissions. Moving forward, we continue to electrify our lease fleet and promote online collaboration, as well as increase our efforts to move travelers to rail transport for shorter distances. With tightened travel budgets in 2025, we aim to curb the growth of travel emissions.

The reduction in use-phase emissions can mainly be explained through reduced sales volume of energy-intensive products, and changes in the sales mix towards more energy efficient products. To reduce the impact of our sold products we are implementing energy efficiency measures for our existing and future installed base. This is closely tied to our EcoDesign commitment of having all new product introductions EcoDesigned by 2025. This is further explored under EcoDesign. We are also involved in novel partnerships with our customers to ensure reduced energy consumption and increased renewable energy usage of our devices. For more information on our partnerships please refer to Advocacy activities and expenses. Philips’ GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits Although reduction is key to achieving carbon neutrality, unavoidable carbon emissions require compensation. This is achieved by the cancellation of acquired carbon credits. In 2024, we offset a total of 474 kilotonnes CO2-e, equivalent to the annual uptake of approximately 14.2 million medium-sized oak trees. To plant all these trees an area of 512 million m2 would be required, equivalent to 9 times the area of Manhattan. This covers our operational carbon footprint, which includes all CO2-e emissions from our sites, business travel, and transportation and distribution. We thereby address climate change outside our own value chain and contribute to the reduction of global CO2-e emissions that we cannot eliminate along our own value chain. These activities complement our existing climate strategy and are excluded from our Science Based Targets for emission reductions. Thus, ensuring that these investments do not impede the achievement of our carbon reduction targets. Philips not only offsets its operational carbon footprint by funding impactful social and environmental projects but is also proactively exploring innovative approaches to directly reduce carbon emissions in its value chain, particularly for unavoidable transport-related emissions. Although we did not use any biofuels in 2024, we do believe this is a potential lever that can help us reduce our carbon footprint in the future. For future reference we only accept biofuels from wastes, residues and by-products as feedstocks with preference for REDII Annex IX feedstocks for advanced biofuels. This strategic move not only resulted in a modest reduction of emissions, but also aligns with our commitment to nature-based solutions.

"We finance projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with UN Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 12. To ensure these offsets meet our high-quality standard of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting, Philips only procures carbon credits from carbon standards that are endorsed by ICROA, such as VCS Standard and Gold Standard. Each program is also verified by an independent third party. We ensure, through our providers, that the quality criteria of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting are met. In addition, Philips has conducted site visits to some of the projects in our portfolio. None of our credits as of now are subject to corresponding adjustment under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Philips will follow the developments of Article 6 closely to understand if, and when, any of the projects might become subject to corresponding adjustments. Please note that all removal credits are associated with biogenic sinks and linked to activities outside Philips value chain. All our carbon offsets drive social, economic and environmental progress in emerging markets. In 2024 we did not retire any carbon credits from removal projects. Our projects include: Restoring ecosystems and empowering communities through tree planting In Kenya, subsistence farmers are supported to plant and maintain trees on their land through the International Small Group and Tree Planting Program (TIST). This carbon removal project enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and strengthens community resilience, providing co-benefits beyond carbon sequestration. Farmers retain ownership of the trees and their products, receiving training and a share of carbon revenues. As an Afforestation, Reforestation, and Revegetation (ARR) initiative, it is a nature-based solution contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard with the CCB label. Providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption This carbon-emission reduction project is expected to provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in Uganda and reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. Additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. As such, this contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Protecting forests through sustainable production Deforestation is expected to be reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. Unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced, thereby contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. The forest supports the supply of water to other parts of Ethiopia and neighboring countries. It is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy In India, the energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation. This is therefore considered a technological solution that also enables an improvement in livelihoods. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the VCS standard. Improving respiratory health and reducing deforestation through provision of clean cookstoves By supporting a range of cookstove technologies across Ghana and Kenya, the projects improve respiratory health, reduce fuel costs and reduce deforestation. As such, this project contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. This also gives people more time for paid work, thus improving prospects. To ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the Gold Standard. Philips’ internal carbon pricing At Philips, we apply an internal carbon shadow discount price for our IT, Real Estate, Businesses and R&D investments. If an investment may support our climate targets by reducing CO2-e emissions, the relevant Function and/or Business is encouraged to apply EUR 150 discount per saved tonne CO2-e. This enables all Functions and Businesses to incorporate climate impacts in their business case development. Furthermore, by using a discount we proactively incentivize the pursuit of sustainable projects, rather than imposing penalties on unsustainable investments. The scope spans all Philips operations and includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as all the material Scope 3 categories. There are no geographic or business-specific boundaries. This therefore covers 100% of our Scope 1 & 2 targets and approximately 95% of our gross Scope 3 emissions (96% of overall emissions). The price of EUR 150 per metric ton CO2-e is derived from the internationally recognized ReCiPe methodology, in combination with the environmental pricing provided by CE Delft. The price is also validated by an external body other than our assurance provider, namely KPMG and set in alignment with our EP&L statement. The key assumption is that the price of carbon will increase in the future. Therefore, to ensure price stability over the coming years, an uplift was applied to the price of carbon, identified by CE Delft. Please note that the internal carbon pricing is not considered in the financial statements as the assumptions in the financial statements are based on (external) market assumptions.

"please refer to the Climate Resilience report 2024 that can be found via our ESG download page. Most importantly our definitions for the short-, medium-, and long-term diverge from our central definition prescribed by the ESRS. This was done in consultation with other departments, to ensure perpetual business continuity and acknowledge the fact that climate related risks and opportunities generally materialize beyond a 5-year time horizon. It also accounts for the time horizons linked to our commitments.

This aligns and is embedded in our business strategy as well as financial planning. To achieve this, we focus on the following core objectives, prioritized by their potential impact. Further details on underlying assumptions are available in our Climate Resilience report, which has been approved by our administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase Since most of our climate impact occurs downstream during the use-phase of our products, we are dedicated to designing energy-efficient solutions and supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. All new product introductions adhere to our EcoDesign requirements, where energy efficiency is a key focus. This approach allows us to engineer a product portfolio optimized for energy consumption during use, which not only reduces our environmental footprint but also helps our customers lower their operational costs. Moreover, the adoption of renewable energy by our customers, also supports our use phase decarbonization by eliminating CO2-e emissions during the energy generation. We therefore actively support and encourage our customers in their transition to renewables (see Champalimaud case). Our key assumption is that electrical grids will decarbonize in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Stated Policy Scenario (SPS) or Announced Pledge Scenario (APS). Based on preliminary estimates, we expect to reduce our use phase (GHGP category 11) carbon footprint as follows: Philips Group Expected use-phase emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 2,529 2,797 – 2,330 1,590 – 98 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 2,631 2,363 – 2,829 3,570 – 5,062 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 51% 46% - 55% 69% - 98% Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives From a climate perspective, applying circular business models has the potential for significant emission reductions. By retaining materials’ value, we reduce the need for virgin resources and the energy required to produce them, resulting in lower emissions. This approach is led by our Circular Economy team through the principles of ‘use less, use longer, and use again’, which also includes our ambition of ‘closing the loop’. Circular design is one of the key focal areas of EcoDesign, which includes for example design for low weight, which reduces the need for material extraction and thereby contributes to emission reductions. It also includes designing with sustainable materials (recycled, biobased, etc.), which often require less energy to process, cutting down greenhouse gases in the sourcing and manufacturing phase. For our Personal Health segment, for example, this includes replacing virgin plastic packaging with paper-based alternatives or increasing the recycled content of the materials we use. Next, we focus on increasing circular practices at our sites and responsible waste management according to the waste hierarchy. As such we actively monitor the waste management of our industrial sites with the aim of retaining the value of materials. This is further explained in Sustainable Operations. Lastly, we initiated the process to focus on responsibly reusing products and parts at the end of their use. Among other things, this includes refurbishment, and responsible takeback. By recirculating products, parts and materials, we increase the market for used products and ensure materials are longer in use. Altogether we believe that by applying our circularity principles, we will be able to reduce our purchased goods emissions (GHGP category 1) by: Philips Group Expected purchased goods emission reduction in kilotonnes CO2-equivalent unless otherwise stated Current Medium-term Long-term (Expected) emissions level 904 1,023 – 872 812 – 148 Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 275 156 – 307 367 – 1,031 Percentage Reduction compared to 2020 baseline 23% 13% - 26% 31% - 87% Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 189"

"Note II Resource use and circular economy For Philips, resource use and circular economy has, similar to climate change, been a material topic for many years, reconfirmed also by the DMA conducted in 2024. Our first circularity targets were established in the 1990s when we set recycling targets for our manufacturing sites. Since then, we have continued with waste related targets that build on established measurements in line with global waste standards. Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment. This was followed by another commitment in 2018 at Davos to ‘close the loop’ of our large medical equipment, recognizing the need to also take responsible care of them at their end-of-use. This chapter details Philips’ policies, targets, metrics, impacts, risks, opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition towards sustainable resource use and a circular economy. Policies, metrics and targets Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets Our circularity targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to maximize value with minimal consumption of virgin and non-renewable materials. Philips looks at circularity in its broadest sense, meaning that we do not only address the type and weight of the materials we use, but also, for example, dematerialization (e.g. through digitalization), efficiency (e.g., improving utilization), optimizing products-in-use (e.g. upgrades) and take-back of our products at end-of- use. The accompanying table shows how our 2025 circularity targets relate to increasing the circularity of our resource inflows and outflows while reducing waste. These targets also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use. Philips Group Philips 2025 targets linked to circularity of resource inflows and outflows KPIs Increase circular design Increase circular material use rate Minimize primary raw materials Increase sustainable sourcing of renewable materials Ensure waste management Circular revenues EcoDesigned NPIs EcoHero revenues Close the loop on medical equipment Zero waste to landfill Circular materials management Philips tracks progress on its 2025 targets as included in the next table, which also describes key actions to further deliver on these metrics. The progress toward accomplishing these targets is internally monitored on at least a quarterly basis, with quarterly progress externally reported for a selection of these via the Philips results hub.

"We use circular revenues as an overarching target metric that collates practices at Philips related to products, services and solutions that contribute to circularity across all our businesses. It measures the revenue contributions across four of our five strategic circularity areas – Circular design of software and hardware, Circular delivery & finance models, Circular service in-use phase and Circular end-of-use management. Circular revenues addresses circular design, circular material use rate, primary material consumption, renewable resources, plus all layers of the waste hierarchy – from prevention to recycling. Our EcoDesigned NPIs fulfill circular design requirements on, for example, low weight design and sustainable materials that can reduce primary material consumption and increase use of sustainably sourced renewable materials. Requirements to design for disassembly and recycling also support recirculation that improves the circular material use rate. A subset of the EcoHero revenues are related to sales of products that outperform on circular design. These support the increase of circular design, circular material use rate and also minimizing primary raw materials. Hence, this subset of EcoHero revenues is also included in the circular revenues metric. See EcoDesign. For the strategic area circular manufacturing and supply we have separate targets on Zero waste to landfill and Circular materials management that address waste management at our sites including prevention, reuse and recycling. This can, for example, support the provision of secondary materials. See Sustainable Operations. Our target for Close the Loop on medical equipment extends waste management to our customers and beyond our sites, supporting also an increase in circular material use rate and reduction of primary materials. By the end of 2020, Philips ‘closed the loop’ on its large medical equipment by structurally embedding a responsible take-back policy into its customer trade-in offers. This means that for all large equipment that a customer is willing to trade-in at end of use, Philips will, where feasible, take it back for refurbishment and/or parts recovery, or locally recycle it in a certified way to avoid equipment from ending up in landfill. This includes MR, IGT, CT, US and DXR systems. Following our policy implementation for our large medical equipment, Philips is continuing to extend its ’closing the loop’ program to small medical equipment by adapting this policy to fit with the different value drivers, distribution channels and modalities of small equipment. This includes patient monitors, ECGs, and image guided therapy consoles. By 2025, we aim to have a policy in place to responsibly take-back all professional medical equipment sold directly to customers as part of a trade-in offer or as a service at customer request. This excludes consumables, accessories and non-Philips equipment. Philips’ material flows In addition to tracking progress towards our 2025 circularity ambitions, we are also measuring the impact of these on Philips’ material flows. In 2024, Philips put a total weight of 60 kilotonnes of products & parts, 34 kilotonnes of packaging on the market, 20 kilotonnes of waste and less than 0.07 kilotonnes of chemicals via emissions. As such, the total weight of 114 kilotonnes is used as the reference value for all ‘%’ related reporting on material weight. The main materials that Philips used in 2024 for its products, parts and packaging include plastics (29%), metals (18%), cardboard (13%), and paper (7%). A more granular view on the material inflow content (such as whether it’s reused or renewable) and material outflow potential (its ability to re-enter the technical and biological loops of a circular economy) are depicted in the below table. Philips Group Philips material flows 2024 Total weight of products, parts and materials, waste and VOC emissions 114 kilotonnes Material inflow content Recycled content 22 kilotonnes / 19% Renewable content 30 kilotonnes / 26% Reused content (excl. recycled content) 2.6 kilotonnes / 2% Critical raw materials 7.7 kilotonnes / 6.8% Strategic raw materials 7.6 kilotonnes / 6.7% Material outflow potential Recyclable content 87 kilotonnes / 76% Technical materials 75 kilotonnes / 66% Technical recyclable materials 57 kilotonnes / 50% Technical non-recyclable materials 15 kilotonnes / 13% Biological materials 29 kilotonnes / 26% Packaging is a key contributor to both recycled (10%) and renewable content (21%) in 2024. Additionally, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced renewable materials with a certification from, e.g., FSC or ISCC. The numbers are currently low and we are working to improve the reporting process. We continue our efforts to advance our transparency on use of both Critical and Strategic Raw Materials as defined by the European Commission. Our current data shows that most of the critical raw materials (such as aluminum and helium) are also considered strategic. In 2024, the theoretical recyclability of products and packaging was 77% and 97% respectively. While looking at the recyclable content is important, it is also critical to look at the recyclability at a product level. Product design can negatively impact a product’s recyclability, making it harder to recover value from them at the end of their useful lives. To improve product level recyclability of our professional and consumer portfolio, we have developed and started to deploy a recyclability tool that uses product-specific data on the materials and the types of connections used to determine the recyclability rate. Approximately 91% of our total weight is classified either as a technical or biological material. The remaining 9% (3 kilotonnes) includes materials not reported via the EP&L as well as the out of Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 197"
"scope materials within the EP&L. While biological materials like paper are suitable for biological loops, these are also materials that can be recycled and have a high rate of recyclable content. That is why the recyclable content is higher for our biological materials (100%) compared to our technical materials (50%). For our biological and renewable materials, it is important to note that in line with the 1st priority of the cascading principle, these materials are used in our products and packaging and not for energy purposes. Similar to our renewable materials, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced biological materials. The results are similar because most renewable materials are also considered biological. Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care contributed with 2.5 kilotonnes of reused materials. This includes our Circular Edition refurbished medical equipment and recirculated parts. Personal Health contributed with 0.01 kilotonnes from refurbished products. Actions Philips circular revenues, which is our overarching circularity metric, increased with 4% compared to 2023. The step-up is mainly driven by contributions from circular design, mostly from low-weight design and use of sustainable materials. Revenues associated with circular services in use-phase dropped, mainly related to reclassifying products within ‘circular service in use-phase’ to other circular revenue categories. This is also one of the main reasons why circular revenues from circular delivery and financing models increased compared to 2023. Philips Group Philips Circular revenues as % of total Philips revenues 5.5% 7.5% 1.9% 6.1% 3.3% 5.2% 9.2% 5.7% Circular services in-use phase Circular end-of-use management Circular design of software and hardware Circular delivery and financing models 2023 2024 More detailed actions to deliver on our 2025 circularity commitments are described in subsequent sections. Circular design of software and hardware Our EcoDesign program is a key driver for our Circular Economy program. One of the focal areas of EcoDesign is circularity, which encompasses, for example, the application of recycled and bio-based materials and designing for low weight, durability, disassembly, and recycling. A subset of EcoDesigned products, those which specifically outperform on the focal area of circular design, will therefore also be counted as contributing to circular revenues target metric. These include, for example, products that meet defined thresholds on reduced weight compared to competitor products or their predecessors. Durability is a product’s ability to remain functional and relevant when used as intended and can be expressed through different ways such as reliability and lifetime. At this moment, Philips cannot report on the durability of its product groups compared to industry average, as there are no publicly available industry averages for our product groups. We however continue our efforts to optimize lifetime either through circular design requirements (by outperforming on our EcoDesign requirements for ‘design for durability & reliability’ vs predecessor) or for which lifetime extensions and refurbishment can be offered. Most of our medical equipment portfolio is serviceable, including service instructions for professional maintenance, and spare parts and support availability over the product lifetime. Consumer products are being redesigned as required to meet all relevant new standards and regulations including Right to Repair regulations and the EU Battery Directive, if applicable and required. Philips strives to improve professional and consumer repairability of its products, and our design process includes tools to assess repairability. Circular manufacturing and supply In line with our ambition for fully circular operations, Philips applies Lean methodologies to improve processes and continuously reduce the environmental footprint across our sites. Circular materials management is our leading KPI and is not expressed in circular revenues. We retain as much as possible material value of our waste stream through waste management and increasing circular practices at our sites. Waste related to biological materials is taken care of according to the cascading principle, which is similar to the waste hierarchy for which we apply with regards to waste from technical materials. We team up with our supply chain partners to find circular solutions for discarded materials, for example in the ’waste to value’ initiative. For inbound supplier packaging, we aim to replace single-use packaging with more sustainable solutions like reusable boxes to contribute to our packaging waste ambitions from recycling to re-use and reduce. For example, at the Philips Personal Health Industrial Site in Zhuhai 0.8 kilotonnes of plastic waste and 0.4 kilotonnes of cardboard waste were prevented by implementing reusable plastic trays to replace cardboard box partitions and implementing circular systems in which boxes are continuously sent back to the suppliers for them to use again for the supply of future shipments. Through initiatives like this in 2024, a total of 4.8 kilotonnes of waste were prevented or reused, thereby averting end of life emissions of 3.0 kilotonnes of CO2-e (assuming incineration as end-of- life treatment).

"Circular delivery and financing models Circular delivery and financing models enable ecosystem partners, including customers and suppliers, to work closely together on products that incentivize material efficiency across the company’s value chain. This includes leasing, rentals, and service-based models such as Enterprise Monitoring as a Service (EMaaS) and mobile cardiac telemetry monitoring. By subscribing to EMaaS, customers gain access to critical patient monitoring capabilities and managed services. This can help advance staff’s capabilities and analyze performance across care settings to help improve workflows. A collaborative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) conducted with Jackson Health System in Miami-Dade County, Florida also showed Philips patient monitors can help reduce carbon emissions by 685.1 tonnes of CO2-e or 47% compared to previous systems. Through digitalizing documentation flow and telemetry monitoring, the customer was able to eliminate the need for an estimated 6.5 million sheets of paper and 420,000 disposable AA batteries, which can allow the health system to save $1.2 million over a 10-year device lifetime. For our consumer products, we offer, for example, rental programs for Lumea IPL and the Avent breastpump. When the rental period is over, we take the product back and wherever possible, refurbish it so it can be used by another consumer. Circular delivery and financing models also include digital solutions that drive dematerialization, helping to further reduce resource use. Our businesses develop and operate cloud-based informatics solutions for customers, which use less resources compared to running these solutions on IT hardware on premises. For instance, Philips is further advancing our digital pathology solutions with AWS. Digitalizing pathology also reduces the need to process and store glass slides while improving workflow efficiency. Circular service in use-phase During the use-phase of our products, we help our customers to optimize the use of our products to maximize their value. For example in 2024, we upgraded almost 3000 medical systems around the globe combined for HPM, MR, CT, Image Guided Therapy and Ultrasound. For example, our MR SmartPath portfolio helps customers to re-use their existing magnets and convert these to the next-generation MR. Our software upgrades like SmartSpeed increases imaging speed by up to a factor of 3* while reducing power consumption on average by 32% per patient scan** while still using the same equipment. * Compared to Philips SENSE imaging. ** Applicable to BlueSeal SE. Philips SmartSpeed power consumption versus Philips SENSE based scanning. Based on COCIR and in-house simulated environment. Results can vary based on site conditions. Circular end-of-use management Keeping materials in circulation is a vital element of the circular economy. Philips strives to recirculate products and parts that come back to our operations. Medical equipment Operationalizing our ’closing the loop’ commitment has reduced our environmental footprint by enabling us to reclaim more and triage for re-use at highest value. In 2024, as part of ‘Closing the Loop’ Philips: • Reclaimed more than 8,600 systems or pieces of equipment, driven largely by the take-back program for patient monitors (more than 5,800 patient monitors). This is lower than 2023 where we reclaimed 11,500 systems or pieces of equipment. This drop is mainly attributed to less Philips systems and equipment made, influenced also by market conditions. • Managed our active refurbished systems (Circular Edition) installed base of over 10,000 systems. • Locally recycled 0.3 kilotonnes of medical systems and equipment through our certified global recycling network. This is a decrease compared to 2023 where 0.5 kilotonnes was locally recycled. The results are however not comparable to 2023 due to an improvement in the reporting methodology. We have more than 30 years of experience providing hospitals with refurbished systems. Our refurbished portfolios (Circular Edition), offer refurbished imaging systems that are ‘as good as new’ across MR, CT, Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapy Systems, with the same high-quality standards, warranty and service performance levels as you expect from new Philips systems. Our Circular Edition refurbishment factories are compliant with ISO standard 13485 and ISO 14001. In 2024, Philips re-used on average 84% of material weight from returned MR, CT, US and IGT systems during refurbishment, thereby reducing the need for additional materials. The reuse of materials also drives carbon emission savings. For example, the carbon footprint of a refurbished Azurion 7 C20 system is 28% lower compared to a new one, saving 26 tonnes CO2-e emissions, thanks to reusing more than 2,457 kg (80%) of the material weight. This translates to 60% less Scope 3 emissions for a hospital versus a new system. When shifting to renewable electricity during use, the carbon footprint saving goes up to 55%***. In addition, Philips has also recirculated more than 100,000 parts for use again with customers. This includes repaired and recovered parts from the take-back of medical equipment and parts, including also All Parts Medical. *** Comparison of a new Azurion 7 C20 and a refurbished Azurion 7 C20. Based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in line with ISO14040/44 and using ReCiPe2016, EcoInvent3.9.1 database including global average energy mix, COCIR standard for energy consumption, and the average reused weight percentage during refurbishment in Best in 2023. Results will vary based on amount, system type and age of returned systems as well as the country due to, amongst other things, source of energy and logistics. Supply chain emissions refer to all life cycle stages, excluding use-phase and end of life. For a healthcare customer this is equivalent to Scope 3 emissions - for more information, refer to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Consumer products In 2024, we offered refurbished products in 16 countries that also come with a warranty. Our refurbished products include Lumea IPL, shavers, hair care products and baby monitors. This year, we also started to offer refurbished toothbrushes. While we proactively engage with our Business-to-Business customers, including retailers, to responsibly take care of products at end-of-use, products are also disposed via local take back systems. These are discarded by consumers at the end of their useful life, and they are eventually processed by national collection and recycling schemes. Europe has advanced schemes, and in accordance with the recycling rates published for packaging and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations, we estimate that approximately 9 kilotonnes of products (in WEEE category 5) and packaging from our Personal Health business units were recycled in the EU in 2024. This is a decrease compared to the previous year (11.8 kilotonnes), mainly attributable to a shift in methodology for packaging, and lower packaging volumes put to market. The weight of recycled consumer products & packaging is estimated by multiplying the weight of products and Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 199"
"packaging put to market (stemming from the Philips Environmental Profit and Loss Account – EP&L) with the EU WEEE recycling rates. For products, we use a 3-year average weight put to market, and for packaging we use the weight put to market in the reporting year only. This is a slight change from last year, where we used a 3-year average for both. The change in methodology for packaging is because we assume that packaging is disposed of in the year of purchase. Due to this change, this year’s figure is not comparable to last year. Impact, risk and opportunity management In this section, Philips’ nature risk assessment approach (including risks related to resource use and circular economy), and the results of this assessment, will be explained. Philips nature risk assessment approach Philips recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing and mitigating nature-related risks to ensure business continuity and resilience. The Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) report provides information needed by investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other stakeholders to appropriately assess nature-related risks and opportunities, including those related to ESRS E5. To identify and evaluate our impacts and dependencies (actual and potential) and assess related risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy, we applied the Locate, Evaluate, Assess, and Prepare (LEAP) approach, in line with the recommended approach of TNFD. This approach constitutes four stages: Locate (Philips’ interface with nature), Evaluate (Philips’ dependencies and impacts on nature), Assess (Philips’ nature-related risks and opportunities) and Prepare (to respond to and report on material nature-related issues). This is also aligned with the recommended disclosures for Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). As part of the Locate stage, we determined the scope of our risk and opportunities assessment includes Philips’ businesses, regions, and functions focusing on Philips’ 23 manufacturing sites. To apply the LEAP approach, Philips used multiple available tools such as an external risk insurance tool (Munich Re), the Ecosystem Intelligence tool (Ecometrix), and the Philips EP&L. Local teams at our manufacturing sites were involved in the impact assessment to identify high priority nature-related risks and opportunities. As part of the improvement opportunities in developing the LEAP approach, we aim to expand the consultations with local affected stakeholders in the coming years. Philips nature risk assessment results In the Evaluate stage, the dependencies analysis results showed dependencies on the ecosystem services like resource extraction. While resource extraction occurs outside the scope of our manufacturing sites, we further assessed its dependencies and impacts on material flows based on 2023 EP&L data. See Philips material flows for more information. The highest dependencies identified are: Paper & Cardboard (29%), Plastics (29%) and Metals (21%). In terms of materials type, the highest impacts are caused by metals (including processing) (37%), PCBs (33%), and electronics components (10%). Overall, the majority of the material impacts are found in the upstream value chain. As part of the Assess stage, we applied the same time horizons in the climate-related risk assessments. These timeframes are agreed in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) for ‘halting and reversing nature loss’ and ‘living in harmony with nature’. See Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. The main physical and transitional risks include: Physical Philips only uses limited amounts of water, but four manufacturing sites are located in water- stressed regions. Continued and/or expansion of business operations could place additional stress on scarcer water supply. Transitional A high priority risk identified is the volatility of costs of materials due to change in global abundance of resources: Our analysis suggests that the highest risk stems from rising costs from material scarcity due to various geopolitical drivers as well as developments in the non-renewables market in the upstream value chain. Secondly, Philips could face challenges in incorporating EcoDesign criteria from new or upcoming legislation into its products and services. The Prepare phase establishes metrics and targets related to nature-related dependencies and impacts. These have been set as part of our ESG 2025 commitments. For targets linked to circularity of resource inflows, outflows and waste management, see Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets. Allocated Resources to Resource use and circular economy To support the transition towards a circular economy and ensure we meet our external circularity commitments, we have allocated resources. Past and current resources Part of Philips resources is from the proceeds of the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds that were issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework dated April 24, 2019. Refer to Climate change for more information. In addition to the proceeds, we also have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For circular economy, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 83 million (13%) of our CapEx related to our actions to grow circular revenue sales from 'Circular delivery and financing models' and 'Circular end-of-use management'. The former amounts to EUR 72 million from 'CE4.1 Provision of IT/OT data driven solutions' and 'CE5.5. Product-as-a-service and other circular use- and result oriented services'. Their expenditures relate mainly to property, plant, equipment and Right-of-Use assets (75%) followed by intangible assets (25%). The expenditures of ‘Circular end-of-use management’ amounts to EUR 11 million from 'CE5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing' and 'CE5.2 Sales of spare parts'. Their expenditures only relate to property, plant, equipment and Right-of-Use assets. Approximately EUR 361 million (19%) of our OpEx expenditures relate primarily to our actions to grow circular revenue sales from 'Circular delivery and financing models'. This amounts to EUR 357 million from 'CE4.1 Provision of IT/OT Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 200"
"data driven solutions' and 'CE5.5. Product-as-a-service and other circular use- and result oriented services'. Their expenditures relate primarily to research and development (62%) and the remainder to property, plant and equipment related costs including short term leases (38%). Refer to EU Taxonomy disclosures. We have also invested EUR 263 million in Green Innovation in 2024 to support our efforts on circularity such as increasing circular design and shifting to cloud. Future resources The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. EcoDesign EcoDesigned New Product Introduction (NPI) and Green Innovation A target metric for the EcoDesign program is EcoDesigned NPIs, measuring new product introduction that are designed to meet the criteria for EcoDesigned Product that must comply with all applicable legal requirements, Philips policies, and all stated EcoDesigned Product requirements in our four focal areas: Energy, Substances, Circularity and Packaging. For Energy, we, for example, set requirements to deliver low energy consumption during use and standby. For Packaging, we design for minimal weight and volume and maximized recyclability while also using sustainably sourced and recycled materials. Our Circularity requirements include designing with minimal materials, using sustainable materials and optimizing design for e.g. disassembly. For Substances, we work to phase-out hazardous substances and ensure full compliance with the Philips Regulated Substances List (RSL). Our Green Innovation – the Research & Development spend related to the development of EcoDesigned Innovation and Circular Innovation. EcoDesigned Innovations include innovation projects that are designed to contribute to our EcoDesign requirements while Circular innovations relate to innovation projects that primarily aim to contribute to circular revenues. Philips Group Green Innovation per segment in millions of EUR 168 142 263 93 78 109 31 29 94 40 33 60 4 2 0 Other Personal Health Connected Care Diagnosis & Treatment 2022 2023 2024 Diagnosis & Treatment Philips develops innovative solutions that support precision diagnosis and effective, minimally invasive interventions and therapy, while respecting the limits of natural resources. Investments in Green Innovation in 2024 amounted to EUR 109 million compared to EUR 78 million in 2023. Energy efficiency is a key area of focus, especially for our large imaging systems such as MRI. Through circular design (both part of our Circular Economy Program and our EcoDesign program), Philips also pays particular attention to enabling reduction in use of virgin materials, for example, through designing for low weight and enabling the upgrading and re-use of our products. This helps to further increase the value created and decrease the environmental impact Philips can deliver during product use, but also from returned systems as part of our closing the loop commitment on medical equipment. Connected Care Philips’ connected health solutions integrate, collect, combine, and deliver quality data for actionable insights to help improve access to quality care, while respecting the limits of natural resources. Green Innovation investments in 2024 amounted to EUR 94 million, a significant step up compared to 29 million in 2023, mainly driven by investments in new product introductions. For the hardware designs, we are focusing on our focal areas, especially reducing energy and phasing out hazardous material.

"Personal Health Green Innovation investments in 2024 amounted to EUR 60 million, compared to 33 million in 2023. Personal Health continued its work on improving the energy efficiency of its products, and the voluntary phase-out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFR), Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates from, among others, food contact and childcare products. New hairdryers have been launched that are more energy-efficient, with an average efficiency improvement of more than 15% compared to the 2020 baseline. Personal Health also continues to increase circularity by, for example, using sustainable materials in products and packaging. As part of our Personal Health Packaging Program, we have launched additional paper-based packaging solutions for e.g. OneBlade, Baby Monitors and electrical power toothbrushes as part of our transition and phase out of single use plastic from our consumer packaging. Other The segment Other invested EUR 0 million in Green Innovation in 2024, compared to 2 million in 2023. As part of the new operating model, most investments shifted toward the business segments. EcoHero Revenues and Green Revenues Another target metric under the EcoDesign Program is EcoHero revenues, which are generated from products that meet all EcoDesign requirements applicable to new product introductions and outperform in at least one of the focal areas of EcoDesign (Energy, Packaging, Substances and Circularity) either compared to their predecessor or relevant benchmarks, or meeting a set threshold, supported by a sustainability claim. Green Revenues is an additional metric on revenues generated by EcoDesigned products, refurbished products, rentals, leases, as-a-service, upgrades and green services. Philips Group Green Revenues per segment in millions of EUR unless otherwise stated 12,775 12,811 13,689 7,245 7,112 7,299 2,252 2,924 3,047 3,278 2,723 3,343 0 52 0 71.7% 70.5% 76.4% As a % of sales Other Personal Health Connected Care Diagnosis & Treatment 2022 2023 2024 Diagnosis & Treatment EcoHero revenues from Diagnosis & Treatment were 32.9% in 2024. A notable EcoHero launch in 2024 is Radiography 7000M from DXR. Compared to its predecessor (MobileDiagnost wDR), energy consumption is 51% lower. Additional improvements are 22% lower system weight and 13% less packaging weight. Other EcoHeroes include the CT Incisive platform with reduced weight, Ultrasound Epiq and Affiniti with reduced energy compared to their predecessors and the MR 1.5T systems with low helium usage. On average, 1.5T ZBO magnets lose about 1200 liters of liquid helium over 10 year lifetime globally, compared with 0 liters for BlueSeal magnets*. With 1,500 units installed globally, MRI scanners equipped with Philips’ BlueSeal magnet technology have already saved more than 2.75 million liters of helium, since 2018. This year Philips also announced the new BlueSeal XE and SE. Its main environmental benefit compared to predecessor models Ambition X and S, is the standard feature PowerSave+ which ensures additional energy savings by switching automatically to stand-by mode within 30 minutes of idle time. This reduces power consumption by up to 45% and saves up to 40MWh in energy per year **. With EUR 7.3 billion, Green Revenues amounted to 83% of total sales. * Based on typical performance of 1.5T ZBO magnets (Ingenia systems) in the Philips installed base. ** Philips stand-by versus ready-to-scan mode.

"Please note that no carbon pricing scheme associated with our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (ETS, carbon tax, etc.) has a current material impact on our financial statements. Downstream transition events Under the given low global warming scenario, it is assumed that there is strong socio-economic drive to shift towards a low-carbon economy. With more than 60% of our full value chain emissions residing downstream during the use phase of our products this is our main exposure. This could include energy efficiency policies, market forces demanding energy efficiency improvements and consumer preferences that drive technological advancements. The rapid change could lead to a situation where Philips’ current technological capabilities lag behind those of our competitors and where the locked-in GHG emissions of our products inhibit our Scope 3 target achievement. For a more detailed overview of this risk please refer to our Climate Resilience report that is available via our ESG download page. To manage this risk, we continue our focus on energy efficiency, with Energy as one of four key focal areas of our EcoDesign program. All new product introductions are expected to optimize their energy efficiency. For more information on how EcoDesign can help our target achievement besides the transition towards renewable energy please refer to Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. For a quantitative assessment of our locked-in GHG emissions associated with our products please refer to Climate change and more specifically our emission associated with purchased goods and use of sold products. Resources allocated to climate change To strengthen our climate resilience from both adaptation and mitigation perspective and meet external commitments (e.g. Science Based Targets) we have allocated resources to reducing our environmental impact and preparing for potential acute and chronic climate related risks. Past and current resources Philips has allocated resources to enhance environmental resilience, including proceeds from the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework (April 24, 2019). These funds have been invested in Green and Sustainability Eligible Projects aligned with the objectives of: • Reducing value chain emissions (climate mitigation) • Building adaptive capacity (climate adaptation) All bonds issued under the Framework follow the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018, Social Bond Principles 2018 and the ICMA Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018, to ensure that the selected and disclosed projects meet widely recognized criteria. For more information, visit https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/debt.html. We have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For climate mitigation and adaptation, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 3 million (0.3%) of our EU Taxonomy aligned CapEx related to our actions to improve energy efficiency, phase out fossil fuels and build adaptive capacity on site. Refer to our EU Taxonomy disclosures for more. We have also invested EUR 263 million in Green Innovation in 2024 to support our efforts in reducing our biggest emissions contributors which are purchased goods and use of sold products. In total, our aforementioned expenditures cover these key actions related to our decarbonization levers: • Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase • Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives • Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain • Reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon • Transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites Future resources To ensure we meet our future climate targets and continue to build our adaptive capacity, it is important that future resources are allocated to our target achievement, such as: • Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency • Development of EcoDesigned new product introductions and partnerships • Infrastructure resilience, flood defense improvements, and climate-resilient, nature-based solutions The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies: Philips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three Scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two Scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our Scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total carbon footprint. As part of our carbon footprint, Philips also reports on five Scope 3 categories. These are indirect emissions that reside either upstream or downstream and are included in our approved Science Based Target of 42% reduction by 2030. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions These are direct emissions caused by company owned and -controlled entities. For example, the burning of fossil fuels and the use of refrigerants or chemicals on-site generates Scope 1-related CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. Sites report their consumption of refrigerants, and anthropogenic or biogenic-based fuels via our internal sustainability reporting system. Consumption per resource is then aggregated across all sites and multiplied by resource-specific emission factors. This approach is being used for all industrial sites and 80% of our non-industrial sites’ floor area. For all other sites, consumption is extrapolated. For Scope 1 emissions we use two sets of emission factors. For fossil fuels and natural gases, we use the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) database (v1.1 2023 – Global Warming Potentials (GWP) 5th Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 194"
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR)). For all other relevant Scope 1 refrigerants, we use the IPCC database (Either AR6, v1.2 or v1.5, or AR5, v1.2). Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions These are indirect emissions caused by the purchase of electricity, heating, steam, and cooling. These emissions are not generated on our sites but are still directly impacted by our consumption level and contractual agreements. We can therefore reduce these emissions by reducing consumption or by ensuring purchased energy comes from low-emission sources. We report on both market-based and location-based emissions. For the market-based approach, we first subtract the amount of renewable energy acquired or self-generated in a specific region from the actual amount of electricity consumed. All renewable electricity claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy market where the electricity-consuming operations are located, and is tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of Philips. To ensure ‘additionality’, all certificates were generated in 2024 – or maximum six months prior – in the market of consumption and are retired on behalf of Philips. The remainder can then be considered grey electricity, meaning a non- renewable source. We then multiply this by a residual mix emission factor. For more information on our renewable energy methodology please refer to the ESG download page. For the location-based approach, we examine energy purchases and disregard any renewable energy certificates acquired. This amount is then multiplied by grid-average emission factors. The grid emission factors used for the market-based approach are dependent on the location. For sites in the US, we apply the eGrid- specific Residual Mix emission factor (Green-e 2023 v1.1 (2021 Data)), and for sites in Europe we use the AIB European Residual Mixes (2022 v1.1). For all other countries, we apply the IEA emission factors because residual mix emission factors are non-existent for these regions (2023 v1.1 - GWP AR4, or 2022 v1.1 – GWP AR4). For the location-based approach we use eGrid and IEA grid average emission factors (Both v1.1 – GWP AR4). For all other energy purchases we use the emission factors from Bets (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5). Scope 3, category 1 – Purchased goods and services This includes any emissions generated by the consumption of raw materials, components, packaging, and services that are acquired to create and distribute Philips products. This is partially done in alignment with the Philips EP&L statement and only includes production-related goods (e.g., components and parts) and all services that fall under the GHG Protocol described category. Goods-related emissions are calculated using an average data method and services using a spend- based method. Components and material specific emission factors are determined using EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6). These factors are regularly updated and consider the sourcing as well as raw material processing. The impact of purchased services is in contrast based on an input-output model. To derive emissions the Exiobase database (v3.8.2 – GWP AR5 and AR6) is leveraged, which factors in all activities connected to the corresponding service. Scope 3, category 4 – Upstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting components, products, or raw materials from one location to another via a mode owned by a third party. This includes both upstream and mainstream (shipment between Philips facilities) related shipments and can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight, the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 6 – Business travel This covers any mode of transportation that is used by employees for business purposes and operated by a third party, excluding commuting. To calculate business travel emissions, we distinguish air travel and automobile travel. For automobile travel, we include leased vehicles and rented vehicles. All other modes of transportation are not considered due to their minimal usage for business purposes and negligible total impact (e.g., trains in the Netherlands run on renewable electricity). The emissions factors from BEIS (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5) are leveraged as these are updated annually. Scope 3, category 9 – Downstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting finished goods from a Philips facility or third- party warehouse to a customer via a mode owned by a third party. Please note that we are not always able to clearly distinguish shipments paid by Philips or by our customers, thereby slightly deviating from the GHGP. This can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 11 – Use of sold products To calculate the emissions generated during the use phase of our products we are interested in three key variables: the lifetime energy per device, number of products sold per country and country specific emission factors. It should be noted that the energy consumption during the full lifetime of the products sold is included in the emission calculation of the year of sale. To calculate emissions, the country grid average emission factors from EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6) are used. Only the direct energy need during use is accounted for (e.g., electricity to power our products). For more information on our emission and renewable energy calculation methodologies please refer to the ESG download page. This also includes a detailed analysis of the proportion of emissions calculated using primary data from our suppliers.

"Note II Resource use and circular economy For Philips, resource use and circular economy has, similar to climate change, been a material topic for many years, reconfirmed also by the DMA conducted in 2024. Our first circularity targets were established in the 1990s when we set recycling targets for our manufacturing sites. Since then, we have continued with waste related targets that build on established measurements in line with global waste standards. Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment. This was followed by another commitment in 2018 at Davos to ‘close the loop’ of our large medical equipment, recognizing the need to also take responsible care of them at their end-of-use. This chapter details Philips’ policies, targets, metrics, impacts, risks, opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition towards sustainable resource use and a circular economy. Policies, metrics and targets Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets Our circularity targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to maximize value with minimal consumption of virgin and non-renewable materials. Philips looks at circularity in its broadest sense, meaning that we do not only address the type and weight of the materials we use, but also, for example, dematerialization (e.g. through digitalization), efficiency (e.g., improving utilization), optimizing products-in-use (e.g. upgrades) and take-back of our products at end-of- use. The accompanying table shows how our 2025 circularity targets relate to increasing the circularity of our resource inflows and outflows while reducing waste. These targets also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use.

"We use circular revenues as an overarching target metric that collates practices at Philips related to products, services and solutions that contribute to circularity across all our businesses. It measures the revenue contributions across four of our five strategic circularity areas – Circular design of software and hardware, Circular delivery & finance models, Circular service in-use phase and Circular end-of-use management. Circular revenues addresses circular design, circular material use rate, primary material consumption, renewable resources, plus all layers of the waste hierarchy – from prevention to recycling. Our EcoDesigned NPIs fulfill circular design requirements on, for example, low weight design and sustainable materials that can reduce primary material consumption and increase use of sustainably sourced renewable materials. Requirements to design for disassembly and recycling also support recirculation that improves the circular material use rate. A subset of the EcoHero revenues are related to sales of products that outperform on circular design. These support the increase of circular design, circular material use rate and also minimizing primary raw materials. Hence, this subset of EcoHero revenues is also included in the circular revenues metric. See EcoDesign. For the strategic area circular manufacturing and supply we have separate targets on Zero waste to landfill and Circular materials management that address waste management at our sites including prevention, reuse and recycling. This can, for example, support the provision of secondary materials. See Sustainable Operations. Our target for Close the Loop on medical equipment extends waste management to our customers and beyond our sites, supporting also an increase in circular material use rate and reduction of primary materials. By the end of 2020, Philips ‘closed the loop’ on its large medical equipment by structurally embedding a responsible take-back policy into its customer trade-in offers. This means that for all large equipment that a customer is willing to trade-in at end of use, Philips will, where feasible, take it back for refurbishment and/or parts recovery, or locally recycle it in a certified way to avoid equipment from ending up in landfill. This includes MR, IGT, CT, US and DXR systems. Following our policy implementation for our large medical equipment, Philips is continuing to extend its ’closing the loop’ program to small medical equipment by adapting this policy to fit with the different value drivers, distribution channels and modalities of small equipment. This includes patient monitors, ECGs, and image guided therapy consoles. By 2025, we aim to have a policy in place to responsibly take-back all professional medical equipment sold directly to customers as part of a trade-in offer or as a service at customer request. This excludes consumables, accessories and non-Philips equipment. Philips’ material flows In addition to tracking progress towards our 2025 circularity ambitions, we are also measuring the impact of these on Philips’ material flows. In 2024, Philips put a total weight of 60 kilotonnes of products & parts, 34 kilotonnes of packaging on the market, 20 kilotonnes of waste and less than 0.07 kilotonnes of chemicals via emissions. As such, the total weight of 114 kilotonnes is used as the reference value for all ‘%’ related reporting on material weight. The main materials that Philips used in 2024 for its products, parts and packaging include plastics (29%), metals (18%), cardboard (13%), and paper (7%). A more granular view on the material inflow content (such as whether it’s reused or renewable) and material outflow potential (its ability to re-enter the technical and biological loops of a circular economy) are depicted in the below table. Philips Group Philips material flows 2024 Total weight of products, parts and materials, waste and VOC emissions 114 kilotonnes Material inflow content Recycled content 22 kilotonnes / 19% Renewable content 30 kilotonnes / 26% Reused content (excl. recycled content) 2.6 kilotonnes / 2% Critical raw materials 7.7 kilotonnes / 6.8% Strategic raw materials 7.6 kilotonnes / 6.7% Material outflow potential Recyclable content 87 kilotonnes / 76% Technical materials 75 kilotonnes / 66% Technical recyclable materials 57 kilotonnes / 50% Technical non-recyclable materials 15 kilotonnes / 13% Biological materials 29 kilotonnes / 26% Packaging is a key contributor to both recycled (10%) and renewable content (21%) in 2024. Additionally, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced renewable materials with a certification from, e.g., FSC or ISCC. The numbers are currently low and we are working to improve the reporting process. We continue our efforts to advance our transparency on use of both Critical and Strategic Raw Materials as defined by the European Commission. Our current data shows that most of the critical raw materials (such as aluminum and helium) are also considered strategic. In 2024, the theoretical recyclability of products and packaging was 77% and 97% respectively. While looking at the recyclable content is important, it is also critical to look at the recyclability at a product level. Product design can negatively impact a product’s recyclability, making it harder to recover value from them at the end of their useful lives. To improve product level recyclability of our professional and consumer portfolio, we have developed and started to deploy a recyclability tool that uses product-specific data on the materials and the types of connections used to determine the recyclability rate. Approximately 91% of our total weight is classified either as a technical or biological material. The remaining 9% (3 kilotonnes) includes materials not reported via the EP&L as well as the out of Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 197"
"scope materials within the EP&L. While biological materials like paper are suitable for biological loops, these are also materials that can be recycled and have a high rate of recyclable content. That is why the recyclable content is higher for our biological materials (100%) compared to our technical materials (50%). For our biological and renewable materials, it is important to note that in line with the 1st priority of the cascading principle, these materials are used in our products and packaging and not for energy purposes. Similar to our renewable materials, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced biological materials. The results are similar because most renewable materials are also considered biological. Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care contributed with 2.5 kilotonnes of reused materials. This includes our Circular Edition refurbished medical equipment and recirculated parts. Personal Health contributed with 0.01 kilotonnes from refurbished products. Actions Philips circular revenues, which is our overarching circularity metric, increased with 4% compared to 2023. The step-up is mainly driven by contributions from circular design, mostly from low-weight design and use of sustainable materials. Revenues associated with circular services in use-phase dropped, mainly related to reclassifying products within ‘circular service in use-phase’ to other circular revenue categories. This is also one of the main reasons why circular revenues from circular delivery and financing models increased compared to 2023. Philips Group Philips Circular revenues as % of total Philips revenues 5.5% 7.5% 1.9% 6.1% 3.3% 5.2% 9.2% 5.7% Circular services in-use phase Circular end-of-use management Circular design of software and hardware Circular delivery and financing models 2023 2024 More detailed actions to deliver on our 2025 circularity commitments are described in subsequent sections. Circular design of software and hardware Our EcoDesign program is a key driver for our Circular Economy program. One of the focal areas of EcoDesign is circularity, which encompasses, for example, the application of recycled and bio-based materials and designing for low weight, durability, disassembly, and recycling. A subset of EcoDesigned products, those which specifically outperform on the focal area of circular design, will therefore also be counted as contributing to circular revenues target metric. These include, for example, products that meet defined thresholds on reduced weight compared to competitor products or their predecessors. Durability is a product’s ability to remain functional and relevant when used as intended and can be expressed through different ways such as reliability and lifetime. At this moment, Philips cannot report on the durability of its product groups compared to industry average, as there are no publicly available industry averages for our product groups. We however continue our efforts to optimize lifetime either through circular design requirements (by outperforming on our EcoDesign requirements for ‘design for durability & reliability’ vs predecessor) or for which lifetime extensions and refurbishment can be offered. Most of our medical equipment portfolio is serviceable, including service instructions for professional maintenance, and spare parts and support availability over the product lifetime. Consumer products are being redesigned as required to meet all relevant new standards and regulations including Right to Repair regulations and the EU Battery Directive, if applicable and required. Philips strives to improve professional and consumer repairability of its products, and our design process includes tools to assess repairability. Circular manufacturing and supply In line with our ambition for fully circular operations, Philips applies Lean methodologies to improve processes and continuously reduce the environmental footprint across our sites. Circular materials management is our leading KPI and is not expressed in circular revenues. We retain as much as possible material value of our waste stream through waste management and increasing circular practices at our sites. Waste related to biological materials is taken care of according to the cascading principle, which is similar to the waste hierarchy for which we apply with regards to waste from technical materials. We team up with our supply chain partners to find circular solutions for discarded materials, for example in the ’waste to value’ initiative. For inbound supplier packaging, we aim to replace single-use packaging with more sustainable solutions like reusable boxes to contribute to our packaging waste ambitions from recycling to re-use and reduce. For example, at the Philips Personal Health Industrial Site in Zhuhai 0.8 kilotonnes of plastic waste and 0.4 kilotonnes of cardboard waste were prevented by implementing reusable plastic trays to replace cardboard box partitions and implementing circular systems in which boxes are continuously sent back to the suppliers for them to use again for the supply of future shipments. Through initiatives like this in 2024, a total of 4.8 kilotonnes of waste were prevented or reused, thereby averting end of life emissions of 3.0 kilotonnes of CO2-e (assuming incineration as end-of- life treatment).

"Please note that no carbon pricing scheme associated with our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (ETS, carbon tax, etc.) has a current material impact on our financial statements. Downstream transition events Under the given low global warming scenario, it is assumed that there is strong socio-economic drive to shift towards a low-carbon economy. With more than 60% of our full value chain emissions residing downstream during the use phase of our products this is our main exposure. This could include energy efficiency policies, market forces demanding energy efficiency improvements and consumer preferences that drive technological advancements. The rapid change could lead to a situation where Philips’ current technological capabilities lag behind those of our competitors and where the locked-in GHG emissions of our products inhibit our Scope 3 target achievement. For a more detailed overview of this risk please refer to our Climate Resilience report that is available via our ESG download page. To manage this risk, we continue our focus on energy efficiency, with Energy as one of four key focal areas of our EcoDesign program. All new product introductions are expected to optimize their energy efficiency. For more information on how EcoDesign can help our target achievement besides the transition towards renewable energy please refer to Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. For a quantitative assessment of our locked-in GHG emissions associated with our products please refer to Climate change and more specifically our emission associated with purchased goods and use of sold products. Resources allocated to climate change To strengthen our climate resilience from both adaptation and mitigation perspective and meet external commitments (e.g. Science Based Targets) we have allocated resources to reducing our environmental impact and preparing for potential acute and chronic climate related risks. Past and current resources Philips has allocated resources to enhance environmental resilience, including proceeds from the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework (April 24, 2019). These funds have been invested in Green and Sustainability Eligible Projects aligned with the objectives of: • Reducing value chain emissions (climate mitigation) • Building adaptive capacity (climate adaptation) All bonds issued under the Framework follow the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018, Social Bond Principles 2018 and the ICMA Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018, to ensure that the selected and disclosed projects meet widely recognized criteria. For more information, visit https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/debt.html. We have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For climate mitigation and adaptation, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 3 million (0.3%) of our EU Taxonomy aligned CapEx related to our actions to improve energy efficiency, phase out fossil fuels and build adaptive capacity on site. Refer to our EU Taxonomy disclosures for more. We have also invested EUR 263 million in Green Innovation in 2024 to support our efforts in reducing our biggest emissions contributors which are purchased goods and use of sold products. In total, our aforementioned expenditures cover these key actions related to our decarbonization levers: • Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase • Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives • Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain • Reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon • Transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites Future resources To ensure we meet our future climate targets and continue to build our adaptive capacity, it is important that future resources are allocated to our target achievement, such as: • Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency • Development of EcoDesigned new product introductions and partnerships • Infrastructure resilience, flood defense improvements, and climate-resilient, nature-based solutions The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies: Philips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three Scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two Scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our Scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total carbon footprint. As part of our carbon footprint, Philips also reports on five Scope 3 categories. These are indirect emissions that reside either upstream or downstream and are included in our approved Science Based Target of 42% reduction by 2030. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions These are direct emissions caused by company owned and -controlled entities. For example, the burning of fossil fuels and the use of refrigerants or chemicals on-site generates Scope 1-related CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. Sites report their consumption of refrigerants, and anthropogenic or biogenic-based fuels via our internal sustainability reporting system. Consumption per resource is then aggregated across all sites and multiplied by resource-specific emission factors. This approach is being used for all industrial sites and 80% of our non-industrial sites’ floor area. For all other sites, consumption is extrapolated. For Scope 1 emissions we use two sets of emission factors. For fossil fuels and natural gases, we use the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) database (v1.1 2023 – Global Warming Potentials (GWP) 5th Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 194"
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR)). For all other relevant Scope 1 refrigerants, we use the IPCC database (Either AR6, v1.2 or v1.5, or AR5, v1.2). Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions These are indirect emissions caused by the purchase of electricity, heating, steam, and cooling. These emissions are not generated on our sites but are still directly impacted by our consumption level and contractual agreements. We can therefore reduce these emissions by reducing consumption or by ensuring purchased energy comes from low-emission sources. We report on both market-based and location-based emissions. For the market-based approach, we first subtract the amount of renewable energy acquired or self-generated in a specific region from the actual amount of electricity consumed. All renewable electricity claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy market where the electricity-consuming operations are located, and is tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of Philips. To ensure ‘additionality’, all certificates were generated in 2024 – or maximum six months prior – in the market of consumption and are retired on behalf of Philips. The remainder can then be considered grey electricity, meaning a non- renewable source. We then multiply this by a residual mix emission factor. For more information on our renewable energy methodology please refer to the ESG download page. For the location-based approach, we examine energy purchases and disregard any renewable energy certificates acquired. This amount is then multiplied by grid-average emission factors. The grid emission factors used for the market-based approach are dependent on the location. For sites in the US, we apply the eGrid- specific Residual Mix emission factor (Green-e 2023 v1.1 (2021 Data)), and for sites in Europe we use the AIB European Residual Mixes (2022 v1.1). For all other countries, we apply the IEA emission factors because residual mix emission factors are non-existent for these regions (2023 v1.1 - GWP AR4, or 2022 v1.1 – GWP AR4). For the location-based approach we use eGrid and IEA grid average emission factors (Both v1.1 – GWP AR4). For all other energy purchases we use the emission factors from Bets (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5). Scope 3, category 1 – Purchased goods and services This includes any emissions generated by the consumption of raw materials, components, packaging, and services that are acquired to create and distribute Philips products. This is partially done in alignment with the Philips EP&L statement and only includes production-related goods (e.g., components and parts) and all services that fall under the GHG Protocol described category. Goods-related emissions are calculated using an average data method and services using a spend- based method. Components and material specific emission factors are determined using EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6). These factors are regularly updated and consider the sourcing as well as raw material processing. The impact of purchased services is in contrast based on an input-output model. To derive emissions the Exiobase database (v3.8.2 – GWP AR5 and AR6) is leveraged, which factors in all activities connected to the corresponding service. Scope 3, category 4 – Upstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting components, products, or raw materials from one location to another via a mode owned by a third party. This includes both upstream and mainstream (shipment between Philips facilities) related shipments and can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight, the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 6 – Business travel This covers any mode of transportation that is used by employees for business purposes and operated by a third party, excluding commuting. To calculate business travel emissions, we distinguish air travel and automobile travel. For automobile travel, we include leased vehicles and rented vehicles. All other modes of transportation are not considered due to their minimal usage for business purposes and negligible total impact (e.g., trains in the Netherlands run on renewable electricity). The emissions factors from BEIS (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5) are leveraged as these are updated annually. Scope 3, category 9 – Downstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting finished goods from a Philips facility or third- party warehouse to a customer via a mode owned by a third party. Please note that we are not always able to clearly distinguish shipments paid by Philips or by our customers, thereby slightly deviating from the GHGP. This can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 11 – Use of sold products To calculate the emissions generated during the use phase of our products we are interested in three key variables: the lifetime energy per device, number of products sold per country and country specific emission factors. It should be noted that the energy consumption during the full lifetime of the products sold is included in the emission calculation of the year of sale. To calculate emissions, the country grid average emission factors from EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6) are used. Only the direct energy need during use is accounted for (e.g., electricity to power our products). For more information on our emission and renewable energy calculation methodologies please refer to the ESG download page. This also includes a detailed analysis of the proportion of emissions calculated using primary data from our suppliers.

In 2024, Philips put a total weight of 60 kilotonnes of products & parts, 34 kilotonnes of packaging on the market, 20 kilotonnes of waste and less than 0.07 kilotonnes of chemicals via emissions. As such, the total weight of 114 kilotonnes is used as the reference value for all ‘%’ related reporting on material weight. The main materials that Philips used in 2024 for its products, parts and packaging include plastics (29%), metals (18%), cardboard (13%), and paper (7%). A more granular view on the material inflow content (such as whether it’s reused or renewable) and material outflow potential (its ability to re-enter the technical and biological loops of a circular economy) are depicted in the below table. Philips Group Philips material flows 2024 Total weight of products, parts and materials, waste and VOC emissions 114 kilotonnes Material inflow content Recycled content 22 kilotonnes / 19% Renewable content 30 kilotonnes / 26% Reused content (excl. recycled content) 2.6 kilotonnes / 2% Critical raw materials 7.7 kilotonnes / 6.8% Strategic raw materials 7.6 kilotonnes / 6.7% Material outflow potential Recyclable content 87 kilotonnes / 76% Technical materials 75 kilotonnes / 66% Technical recyclable materials 57 kilotonnes / 50% Technical non-recyclable materials 15 kilotonnes / 13% Biological materials 29 kilotonnes / 26% Packaging is a key contributor to both recycled (10%) and renewable content (21%) in 2024. Additionally, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced renewable materials with a certification from, e.g., FSC or ISCC. The numbers are currently low and we are working to improve the reporting process. We continue our efforts to advance our transparency on use of both Critical and Strategic Raw Materials as defined by the European Commission. Our current data shows that most of the critical raw materials (such as aluminum and helium) are also considered strategic. In 2024, the theoretical recyclability of products and packaging was 77% and 97% respectively. While looking at the recyclable content is important, it is also critical to look at the recyclability at a product level. Product design can negatively impact a product’s recyclability, making it harder to recover value from them at the end of their useful lives. To improve product level recyclability of our professional and consumer portfolio, we have developed and started to deploy a recyclability tool that uses product-specific data on the materials and the types of connections used to determine the recyclability rate. Approximately 91% of our total weight is classified either as a technical or biological material. The remaining 9% (3 kilotonnes) includes materials not reported via the EP&L as well as the out of Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 197"
"scope materials within the EP&L. While biological materials like paper are suitable for biological loops, these are also materials that can be recycled and have a high rate of recyclable content. That is why the recyclable content is higher for our biological materials (100%) compared to our technical materials (50%). For our biological and renewable materials, it is important to note that in line with the 1st priority of the cascading principle, these materials are used in our products and packaging and not for energy purposes. Similar to our renewable materials, 1% of Philips material flow was from sustainably sourced biological materials. The results are similar because most renewable materials are also considered biological. Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care contributed with 2.5 kilotonnes of reused materials. This includes our Circular Edition refurbished medical equipment and recirculated parts. Personal Health contributed with 0.01 kilotonnes from refurbished products. Actions Philips circular revenues, which is our overarching circularity metric, increased with 4% compared to 2023. The step-up is mainly driven by contributions from circular design, mostly from low-weight design and use of sustainable materials. Revenues associated with circular services in use-phase dropped, mainly related to reclassifying products within ‘circular service in use-phase’ to other circular revenue categories. This is also one of the main reasons why circular revenues from circular delivery and financing models increased compared to 2023.

Circular design of software and hardware Our EcoDesign program is a key driver for our Circular Economy program. One of the focal areas of EcoDesign is circularity, which encompasses, for example, the application of recycled and bio-based materials and designing for low weight, durability, disassembly, and recycling. A subset of EcoDesigned products, those which specifically outperform on the focal area of circular design, will therefore also be counted as contributing to circular revenues target metric. These include, for example, products that meet defined thresholds on reduced weight compared to competitor products or their predecessors. Durability is a product’s ability to remain functional and relevant when used as intended and can be expressed through different ways such as reliability and lifetime. At this moment, Philips cannot report on the durability of its product groups compared to industry average, as there are no publicly available industry averages for our product groups. We however continue our efforts to optimize lifetime either through circular design requirements (by outperforming on our EcoDesign requirements for ‘design for durability & reliability’ vs predecessor) or for which lifetime extensions and refurbishment can be offered. Most of our medical equipment portfolio is serviceable, including service instructions for professional maintenance, and spare parts and support availability over the product lifetime. Consumer products are being redesigned as required to meet all relevant new standards and regulations including Right to Repair regulations and the EU Battery Directive, if applicable and required. Philips strives to improve professional and consumer repairability of its products, and our design process includes tools to assess repairability. Circular manufacturing and supply In line with our ambition for fully circular operations, Philips applies Lean methodologies to improve processes and continuously reduce the environmental footprint across our sites. Circular materials management is our leading KPI and is not expressed in circular revenues. We retain as much as possible material value of our waste stream through waste management and increasing circular practices at our sites. Waste related to biological materials is taken care of according to the cascading principle, which is similar to the waste hierarchy for which we apply with regards to waste from technical materials. We team up with our supply chain partners to find circular solutions for discarded materials, for example in the ’waste to value’ initiative. For inbound supplier packaging, we aim to replace single-use packaging with more sustainable solutions like reusable boxes to contribute to our packaging waste ambitions from recycling to re-use and reduce. For example, at the Philips Personal Health Industrial Site in Zhuhai 0.8 kilotonnes of plastic waste and 0.4 kilotonnes of cardboard waste were prevented by implementing reusable plastic trays to replace cardboard box partitions and implementing circular systems in which boxes are continuously sent back to the suppliers for them to use again for the supply of future shipments. Through initiatives like this in 2024, a total of 4.8 kilotonnes of waste were prevented or reused, thereby averting end of life emissions of 3.0 kilotonnes of CO2-e (assuming incineration as end-of- life treatment).

"Please note that no carbon pricing scheme associated with our Scope 1 and 2 emissions (ETS, carbon tax, etc.) has a current material impact on our financial statements. Downstream transition events Under the given low global warming scenario, it is assumed that there is strong socio-economic drive to shift towards a low-carbon economy. With more than 60% of our full value chain emissions residing downstream during the use phase of our products this is our main exposure. This could include energy efficiency policies, market forces demanding energy efficiency improvements and consumer preferences that drive technological advancements. The rapid change could lead to a situation where Philips’ current technological capabilities lag behind those of our competitors and where the locked-in GHG emissions of our products inhibit our Scope 3 target achievement. For a more detailed overview of this risk please refer to our Climate Resilience report that is available via our ESG download page. To manage this risk, we continue our focus on energy efficiency, with Energy as one of four key focal areas of our EcoDesign program. All new product introductions are expected to optimize their energy efficiency. For more information on how EcoDesign can help our target achievement besides the transition towards renewable energy please refer to Philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. For a quantitative assessment of our locked-in GHG emissions associated with our products please refer to Climate change and more specifically our emission associated with purchased goods and use of sold products. Resources allocated to climate change To strengthen our climate resilience from both adaptation and mitigation perspective and meet external commitments (e.g. Science Based Targets) we have allocated resources to reducing our environmental impact and preparing for potential acute and chronic climate related risks. Past and current resources Philips has allocated resources to enhance environmental resilience, including proceeds from the Green and Sustainability Innovation Bonds issued under Philips’ Green and Sustainability Innovation Bond Framework (April 24, 2019). These funds have been invested in Green and Sustainability Eligible Projects aligned with the objectives of: • Reducing value chain emissions (climate mitigation) • Building adaptive capacity (climate adaptation) All bonds issued under the Framework follow the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2018, Social Bond Principles 2018 and the ICMA Sustainability Bond Guidelines 2018, to ensure that the selected and disclosed projects meet widely recognized criteria. For more information, visit https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/debt.html. We have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. For climate mitigation and adaptation, a subset of the expenditures for the EU Taxonomy reporting are relevant. This is equivalent to approximately EUR 3 million (0.3%) of our EU Taxonomy aligned CapEx related to our actions to improve energy efficiency, phase out fossil fuels and build adaptive capacity on site. Refer to our EU Taxonomy disclosures for more. We have also invested EUR 263 million in Green Innovation in 2024 to support our efforts in reducing our biggest emissions contributors which are purchased goods and use of sold products. In total, our aforementioned expenditures cover these key actions related to our decarbonization levers: • Designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase • Minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives • Collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain • Reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon • Transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites Future resources To ensure we meet our future climate targets and continue to build our adaptive capacity, it is important that future resources are allocated to our target achievement, such as: • Investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency • Development of EcoDesigned new product introductions and partnerships • Infrastructure resilience, flood defense improvements, and climate-resilient, nature-based solutions The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. Philips’ Emission calculation methodologies: Philips reports in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). The GHGP distinguishes three Scopes, as described below. The GHGP requires businesses to report on the first two Scopes to comply with the GHGP reporting standards. As per the updated GHGP Scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our Scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. The market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total carbon footprint. As part of our carbon footprint, Philips also reports on five Scope 3 categories. These are indirect emissions that reside either upstream or downstream and are included in our approved Science Based Target of 42% reduction by 2030. Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions These are direct emissions caused by company owned and -controlled entities. For example, the burning of fossil fuels and the use of refrigerants or chemicals on-site generates Scope 1-related CO2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. Sites report their consumption of refrigerants, and anthropogenic or biogenic-based fuels via our internal sustainability reporting system. Consumption per resource is then aggregated across all sites and multiplied by resource-specific emission factors. This approach is being used for all industrial sites and 80% of our non-industrial sites’ floor area. For all other sites, consumption is extrapolated. For Scope 1 emissions we use two sets of emission factors. For fossil fuels and natural gases, we use the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) database (v1.1 2023 – Global Warming Potentials (GWP) 5th Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 194"
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment Report (AR)). For all other relevant Scope 1 refrigerants, we use the IPCC database (Either AR6, v1.2 or v1.5, or AR5, v1.2). Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions These are indirect emissions caused by the purchase of electricity, heating, steam, and cooling. These emissions are not generated on our sites but are still directly impacted by our consumption level and contractual agreements. We can therefore reduce these emissions by reducing consumption or by ensuring purchased energy comes from low-emission sources. We report on both market-based and location-based emissions. For the market-based approach, we first subtract the amount of renewable energy acquired or self-generated in a specific region from the actual amount of electricity consumed. All renewable electricity claimed by Philips is sourced from the same energy market where the electricity-consuming operations are located, and is tracked and redeemed, retired, or cancelled solely on behalf of Philips. To ensure ‘additionality’, all certificates were generated in 2024 – or maximum six months prior – in the market of consumption and are retired on behalf of Philips. The remainder can then be considered grey electricity, meaning a non- renewable source. We then multiply this by a residual mix emission factor. For more information on our renewable energy methodology please refer to the ESG download page. For the location-based approach, we examine energy purchases and disregard any renewable energy certificates acquired. This amount is then multiplied by grid-average emission factors. The grid emission factors used for the market-based approach are dependent on the location. For sites in the US, we apply the eGrid- specific Residual Mix emission factor (Green-e 2023 v1.1 (2021 Data)), and for sites in Europe we use the AIB European Residual Mixes (2022 v1.1). For all other countries, we apply the IEA emission factors because residual mix emission factors are non-existent for these regions (2023 v1.1 - GWP AR4, or 2022 v1.1 – GWP AR4). For the location-based approach we use eGrid and IEA grid average emission factors (Both v1.1 – GWP AR4). For all other energy purchases we use the emission factors from Bets (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5). Scope 3, category 1 – Purchased goods and services This includes any emissions generated by the consumption of raw materials, components, packaging, and services that are acquired to create and distribute Philips products. This is partially done in alignment with the Philips EP&L statement and only includes production-related goods (e.g., components and parts) and all services that fall under the GHG Protocol described category. Goods-related emissions are calculated using an average data method and services using a spend- based method. Components and material specific emission factors are determined using EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6). These factors are regularly updated and consider the sourcing as well as raw material processing. The impact of purchased services is in contrast based on an input-output model. To derive emissions the Exiobase database (v3.8.2 – GWP AR5 and AR6) is leveraged, which factors in all activities connected to the corresponding service. Scope 3, category 4 – Upstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting components, products, or raw materials from one location to another via a mode owned by a third party. This includes both upstream and mainstream (shipment between Philips facilities) related shipments and can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight, the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 6 – Business travel This covers any mode of transportation that is used by employees for business purposes and operated by a third party, excluding commuting. To calculate business travel emissions, we distinguish air travel and automobile travel. For automobile travel, we include leased vehicles and rented vehicles. All other modes of transportation are not considered due to their minimal usage for business purposes and negligible total impact (e.g., trains in the Netherlands run on renewable electricity). The emissions factors from BEIS (v1.1 2023 – GWP AR5) are leveraged as these are updated annually. Scope 3, category 9 – Downstream transportation and distribution This includes all emissions generated by transporting finished goods from a Philips facility or third- party warehouse to a customer via a mode owned by a third party. Please note that we are not always able to clearly distinguish shipments paid by Philips or by our customers, thereby slightly deviating from the GHGP. This can include transport via air, road, or sea. Rail transport is rarely used by Philips and therefore has a negligible influence on total emissions. For air freight, road freight or less than a container load ocean freight the emission factors from BEIS are leveraged (v1.1 2023 - GWP AR5). For full container load transports the emission factors from Clean Cargo are used (version 2022 – GWP AR6). Scope 3, category 11 – Use of sold products To calculate the emissions generated during the use phase of our products we are interested in three key variables: the lifetime energy per device, number of products sold per country and country specific emission factors. It should be noted that the energy consumption during the full lifetime of the products sold is included in the emission calculation of the year of sale. To calculate emissions, the country grid average emission factors from EcoInvent (v3.9.1 – GWP AR6) are used. Only the direct energy need during use is accounted for (e.g., electricity to power our products). For more information on our emission and renewable energy calculation methodologies please refer to the ESG download page. This also includes a detailed analysis of the proportion of emissions calculated using primary data from our suppliers.

"Note II Resource use and circular economy For Philips, resource use and circular economy has, similar to climate change, been a material topic for many years, reconfirmed also by the DMA conducted in 2024. Our first circularity targets were established in the 1990s when we set recycling targets for our manufacturing sites. Since then, we have continued with waste related targets that build on established measurements in line with global waste standards. Recognizing that circularity goes beyond waste, already in 2016, we committed to deliver 15% circular revenues by 2020, building on experiences from the significant progress through our Green Revenue commitment. This was followed by another commitment in 2018 at Davos to ‘close the loop’ of our large medical equipment, recognizing the need to also take responsible care of them at their end-of-use. This chapter details Philips’ policies, targets, metrics, impacts, risks, opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition towards sustainable resource use and a circular economy. Policies, metrics and targets Philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets Our circularity targets are in line with our Environmental Policy, aiming to maximize value with minimal consumption of virgin and non-renewable materials. Philips looks at circularity in its broadest sense, meaning that we do not only address the type and weight of the materials we use, but also, for example, dematerialization (e.g. through digitalization), efficiency (e.g., improving utilization), optimizing products-in-use (e.g. upgrades) and take-back of our products at end-of- use. The accompanying table shows how our 2025 circularity targets relate to increasing the circularity of our resource inflows and outflows while reducing waste. These targets also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use. Philips Group Philips 2025 targets linked to circularity of resource inflows and outflows KPIs Increase circular design Increase circular material use rate Minimize primary raw materials Increase sustainable sourcing of renewable materials Ensure waste management Circular revenues EcoDesigned NPIs EcoHero revenues Close the loop on medical equipment Zero waste to landfill Circular materials management Philips tracks progress on its 2025 targets as included in the next table, which also describes key actions to further deliver on these metrics. The progress toward accomplishing these targets is internally monitored on at least a quarterly basis, with quarterly progress externally reported for a selection of these via the Philips results hub.

"We use circular revenues as an overarching target metric that collates practices at Philips related to products, services and solutions that contribute to circularity across all our businesses. It measures the revenue contributions across four of our five strategic circularity areas – Circular design of software and hardware, Circular delivery & finance models, Circular service in-use phase and Circular end-of-use management. Circular revenues addresses circular design, circular material use rate, primary material consumption, renewable resources, plus all layers of the waste hierarchy – from prevention to recycling. Our EcoDesigned NPIs fulfill circular design requirements on, for example, low weight design and sustainable materials that can reduce primary material consumption and increase use of sustainably sourced renewable materials. Requirements to design for disassembly and recycling also support recirculation that improves the circular material use rate. A subset of the EcoHero revenues are related to sales of products that outperform on circular design. These support the increase of circular design, circular material use rate and also minimizing primary raw materials. Hence, this subset of EcoHero revenues is also included in the circular revenues metric. See EcoDesign. For the strategic area circular manufacturing and supply we have separate targets on Zero waste to landfill and Circular materials management that address waste management at our sites including prevention, reuse and recycling. This can, for example, support the provision of secondary materials. See Sustainable Operations. Our target for Close the Loop on medical equipment extends waste management to our customers and beyond our sites, supporting also an increase in circular material use rate and reduction of primary materials. By the end of 2020, Philips ‘closed the loop’ on its large medical equipment by structurally embedding a responsible take-back policy into its customer trade-in offers. This means that for all large equipment that a customer is willing to trade-in at end of use, Philips will, where feasible, take it back for refurbishment and/or parts recovery, or locally recycle it in a certified way to avoid equipment from ending up in landfill. This includes MR, IGT, CT, US and DXR systems. Following our policy implementation for our large medical equipment, Philips is continuing to extend its ’closing the loop’ program to small medical equipment by adapting this policy to fit with the different value drivers, distribution channels and modalities of small equipment. This includes patient monitors, ECGs, and image guided therapy consoles. By 2025, we aim to have a policy in place to responsibly take-back all professional medical equipment sold directly to customers as part of a trade-in offer or as a service at customer request. This excludes consumables, accessories and non-Philips equipment. Philips’ material flows In addition to tracking progress towards our 2025 circularity ambitions, we are also measuring the impact of these on Philips’ material flows.

Future resources The final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. EcoDesign EcoDesigned New Product Introduction (NPI) and Green Innovation A target metric for the EcoDesign program is EcoDesigned NPIs, measuring new product introduction that are designed to meet the criteria for EcoDesigned Product that must comply with all applicable legal requirements, Philips policies, and all stated EcoDesigned Product requirements in our four focal areas: Energy, Substances, Circularity and Packaging. For Energy, we, for example, set requirements to deliver low energy consumption during use and standby. For Packaging, we design for minimal weight and volume and maximized recyclability while also using sustainably sourced and recycled materials. Our Circularity requirements include designing with minimal materials, using sustainable materials and optimizing design for e.g. disassembly. For Substances, we work to phase-out hazardous substances and ensure full compliance with the Philips Regulated Substances List (RSL). Our Green Innovation – the Research & Development spend related to the development of EcoDesigned Innovation and Circular Innovation. EcoDesigned Innovations include innovation projects that are designed to contribute to our EcoDesign requirements while Circular innovations relate to innovation projects that primarily aim to contribute to circular revenues.

Investments in Green Innovation in 2024 amounted to EUR 109 million compared to EUR 78 million in 2023. Energy efficiency is a key area of focus, especially for our large imaging systems such as MRI. Through circular design (both part of our Circular Economy Program and our EcoDesign program), Philips also pays particular attention to enabling reduction in use of virgin materials, for example, through designing for low weight and enabling the upgrading and re-use of our products. This helps to further increase the value created and decrease the environmental impact Philips can deliver during product use, but also from returned systems as part of our closing the loop commitment on medical equipment. Connected Care Philips’ connected health solutions integrate, collect, combine, and deliver quality data for actionable insights to help improve access to quality care, while respecting the limits of natural resources. Green Innovation investments in 2024 amounted to EUR 94 million, a significant step up compared to 29 million in 2023, mainly driven by investments in new product introductions. For the hardware designs, we are focusing on our focal areas, especially reducing energy and phasing out hazardous material.

"Personal Health Green Innovation investments in 2024 amounted to EUR 60 million, compared to 33 million in 2023. Personal Health continued its work on improving the energy efficiency of its products, and the voluntary phase-out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), brominated flame retardants (BFR), Bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates from, among others, food contact and childcare products. New hairdryers have been launched that are more energy-efficient, with an average efficiency improvement of more than 15% compared to the 2020 baseline. Personal Health also continues to increase circularity by, for example, using sustainable materials in products and packaging. As part of our Personal Health Packaging Program, we have launched additional paper-based packaging solutions for e.g. OneBlade, Baby Monitors and electrical power toothbrushes as part of our transition and phase out of single use plastic from our consumer packaging. Other The segment Other invested EUR 0 million in Green Innovation in 2024, compared to 2 million in 2023. As part of the new operating model, most investments shifted toward the business segments. EcoHero Revenues and Green Revenues Another target metric under the EcoDesign Program is EcoHero revenues, which are generated from products that meet all EcoDesign requirements applicable to new product introductions and outperform in at least one of the focal areas of EcoDesign (Energy, Packaging, Substances and Circularity) either compared to their predecessor or relevant benchmarks, or meeting a set threshold, supported by a sustainability claim. Green Revenues is an additional metric on revenues generated by EcoDesigned products, refurbished products, rentals, leases, as-a-service, upgrades and green services.

A notable EcoHero launch in 2024 is Radiography 7000M from DXR. Compared to its predecessor (MobileDiagnost wDR), energy consumption is 51% lower. Additional improvements are 22% lower system weight and 13% less packaging weight. Other EcoHeroes include the CT Incisive platform with reduced weight, Ultrasound Epiq and Affiniti with reduced energy compared to their predecessors and the MR 1.5T systems with low helium usage. On average, 1.5T ZBO magnets lose about 1200 liters of liquid helium over 10 year lifetime globally, compared with 0 liters for BlueSeal magnets*. With 1,500 units installed globally, MRI scanners equipped with Philips’ BlueSeal magnet technology have already saved more than 2.75 million liters of helium, since 2018. This year Philips also announced the new BlueSeal XE and SE. Its main environmental benefit compared to predecessor models Ambition X and S, is the standard feature PowerSave+ which ensures additional energy savings by switching automatically to stand-by mode within 30 minutes of idle time. This reduces power consumption by up to 45% and saves up to 40MWh in energy per year **. With EUR 7.3 billion, Green Revenues amounted to 83% of total sales. * Based on typical performance of 1.5T ZBO magnets (Ingenia systems) in the Philips installed base. ** Philips stand-by versus ready-to-scan mode.

"Connected Care Connected Care’s EcoHero revenues were 5.6% in 2024. Examples of an EcoHero include patient monitors MX750 and MX850. In comparison to it's predecessor (MX800) the MX850 and the MX750 have a significant better energy efficiency. For the MX850 the energy consumption is reduced by 20%, for the MX750 around 30%. With EUR 3.0 billion, Green Revenues amounted to 59% of total. An example is the Philips EcoDesigned PageWriter TC35 cardiograph, with reduced power in on-mode compared to its predecessors TC 20 and TC 30. Personal Health EcoHero revenues from Personal Health were 17.1% in 2024. One example of an EcoHero for Personal Health is the Oral Healthcare Brush Head with biobased content. In our Mother and Child Care portfolio, Philips launched a new baby monitor with 50% mechanically recycled ABS material in the housing, coming in a paper based packaging. With EUR 3.3 billion, Green Revenues were equivalent to 96% of total sales, demonstrating the maturity of the Personal Health business in EcoDesign. Waste In 2024, our manufacturing sites generated 20 kilotonnes of waste, an increase of 4% compared to 2023, mainly driven by the increased amount of reused materials reported from our two sites in the US. The reused materials represent 13% of the total waste in 2024 compared to the 9% in 2023. In the Personal Health segment the waste increased significantly, by 19% due to increased operational waste of the reused materials. Diagnosis & Treatment waste in 2024 was comparable to 2023. Connected Care decreased waste by 31% due to decrease in operational waste at Sleep & Respiratory Care Sites.

We extended the scope with materials sent for re-use and other recovery as of 2021. Total waste does not include waste prevented. Materials delivered for re-use, other recovery or recycling via an external contractor amounted to 18,485 tonnes, which equals 92% of the total waste. Non-recycled waste, classified as materials delivered to incineration and landfill amounted to 1,672 tonnes, which equals 8% of the total waste of which 67% comprised non-hazardous waste and 33% hazardous waste. The total amount of non-recycled waste (subtracting recycled waste from total waste) is 4,211 tonnes, which equals 21% of the total waste of which 2,528 tonnes are prepared for reuse. We recorded 2,314 tonnes of waste prevented in our own activities in 2024, compared to 1,531 tonnes in 2023. Philips did not produce any radioactive waste in 2024.

There is no waste generated that is destined for other disposal methods. Our sites addressed both the Circular Materials Management percentage as well as waste sent to landfill, as part of our ESG commitments; refer to Definitions and abbreviations for the definition of Circular Materials Management. The Circular Materials Management percentage has replaced the recycling percentage in 2021. In 2024, 94% was achieved compared to 91% in 2023, the change was mainly driven by improving operational waste management for instance through reuse of materials and through establishing new partnerships for previously non-recycled materials. Our Zero Waste to Landfill KPI excludes one-time-only waste and waste delivered to landfill due to regulatory requirements. According to this definition, in 2024 our manufacturing sites reported 1.1 tonnes of waste sent to landfill, a significant decrease compared to 2.7 tonnes in 2023. All our 23 industrial sites achieved Zero Waste to Landfill status in 2024.

This preparation is case specific; in some cases it includes separation, inspection and cleaning. The measurement of all the metrics included above for waste were validated by the assurance provider and no further external bodies. Philips methodologies for 2025 circularity targets: Circular revenues: Propositions that qualify for circular revenues must comply with the requirements for at least one of the circular revenue categories. These include, among others, products with low weight or containing a minimum threshold of recycled or bio-based plastics, as- a-service models, software running on cloud, telehealth, upgrades, lifetime extensions, and refurbished equipment. Each contribution is underpinned and connected to sales via Philips management accounting data or via inputs linked to other IT systems. Circular revenues is a financial based metric, providing us with an integral overall view of how we progress and is primarily a steering metric that helps us to move the organization in one overarching direction. It should be seen as one of the multiple metrics needed to drive a business to circularity and to report on its impact. Circular revenues do as such not measure the environmental impact – however, we do measure its scientific impact on our material flow metrics. For more information, please refer to our joint publication with KPMG: ‘Driving circularity in a multinational - Lessons from Philips’. Circular Materials Management: Circular Materials Management is a KPI for promoting an increase in the proportion of waste treated using waste management hierarchy levels that are circular: prevention, re-use, and recycling. Circular Materials Management % is the proportion of materials managed circularly in comparison to the total used materials baseline. The total used materials baseline is the total of both circular and linear waste, excluding linear disposal of waste that is required by law. Circular Materials Management includes recycling, re-use, prevention and other recovery (e.g. repurposing). It excludes all linear disposal, which is classified as waste to energy, incineration and landfill. Philips estimates waste prevented by calculating the reduction in waste generation resulting from in its own activities, based on the Circular Materials Management method. Close the Loop on medical equipment: While our target is to adopt a policy to responsibly take- back all professional medical equipment, we monitor the impact of our Close the Loop on medical equipment by measuring the amount of reclaimed Philips equipment. This refers to the number of systems or pieces of equipment that is returned to us for refurbishment, parts recovery or local recycling. As part of the reporting process, we use the technical expertise of Philips experts. EcoDesign NPI: The EcoDesign adherence of new product introductions is measured at two milestones during the product development process. The measurement includes the parts subject to design change for all hardware products where Philips is the design owner and that results in a full product or system, following the Philips PDLM (Product Development, Launch and Maintenance) process. This excludes for example software, consumables and minor part modifications. Acquisitions and ventures are included once the integration of the EcoDesign process has been completed. The evaluation is performed by internal EcoDesign experts, based on pre-defined criteria that are captured in the Philips EcoDesign requirements standard. EcoHero Revenues: The EcoHero adherence is underpinned similar to EcoDesign new product introductions and connected to sales limited to hardware, measured via Philips management accounting data. They are expressed as a percentage of all revenues related to hardware. A product or solution that has been determined to contribute to EcoHero or Green Revenues will continue to do so until it is decommissioned. Green Revenues: Revenues reported as ‘Green’ are a combination of revenues related to products that were evaluated to meet the EcoDesign criteria at time of introduction and revenues generated by green services, upgrades and refurbished products. Green revenues are measured via Philips management. Green Innovation: Green/EcoDesigned Innovation is measured by the financial spend related to R&D projects that directly contribute to the intended development and maintenance of EcoDesigned or Circular products, technologies or services. The evaluation is performed by internal EcoDesign experts, based on pre-defined criteria that are captured in the Philips standard on Green Innovation. Zero Waste to Landfill: A site is classified as ’zero waste to landfill’ if less than or equal to 0.5% of the total regular waste reported by the site is sent directly to landfill via an external contractor. This excludes one-time waste and waste that is landfilled due to a regulatory requirement. Philips material flow methodology: For our materials flows, we measure the following attributes: recycled, renewable, biological, technical, recyclable, critical raw materials and strategic raw materials. These are mainly measured via our EP&L, which is one of our main data sources capturing the Bill of Materials (BOM) of reference products and packaging as well as waste data. The packaging BOM for Personal Health businesses (with the exception of certain Mother and Child Care products) is determined via the WEEE packaging data and assumes an average weight per material. The methodology to use different sources is the best estimate by Philips and we allow a 5% deviation in weight. The waste Contents 1 Our Management 2 Strategy 3 Financial performance 4 Environmental, Social and Governance 5 Supervisory Board 6 Group financial statements 7 Company financial statements 8 Sustainability statement 9 Further information 204"
"and VOC emissions data comes from an environmental reporting tool and a sub-set of these are also integrated into our EP&L. We also report on reused content from recirculated parts and refurbished (healthcare and consumer) products. For parts, we use inputs from other IT systems. For the reporting on reused content, the re-used weights from our refurbished equipment are calculated based on a 1-year average re-use % per equipment multiplied by its original weight. For X-ray tubes, only the re-used material weight is considered. For the re-used and refurbished products from Personal Health, as well as reused spare parts for our medical equipment, we have assumed that all product and part weight have been re-used. For shavers, however, we assume the shaver head is always replaced. Since there are different reporting methodologies for reused vs recycled content, there is no double-counting between these metrics. For our biofuel reporting, we have assumed this is equivalent to wood, which is mainly used in our packaging. We have used the technical expertise of Philips experts for our material flow reporting with recycled content and critical & strategic raw materials as exception. For more information on our calculation methodologies please refer to the ESG download page. Philips Circular end-of-use management methodology: Locally recycled medical systems and equipment: To report on the recycling of our medical systems and equipment as part of ‘Closing the loop’, we use primary data from our certified recycling network from which documentation is received on the total material weight. This is then multiplied by the product-level recyclability for total recycled weight. The latter is an improvement in the methodology compared to previous year. Philips Environmental Profit & Loss account and Material Flow reporting methodology: The Philips Environmental Profit & Loss (EP&L) account measures our environmental impact on society at large. The EP&L account is based on Life Cycle Analysis methodology in which the environmental impacts are expressed in monetary terms using specific conversion factors. The outcomes help us to assess the highest impact areas, but we do not have targets for the EP&L. Our material flow captures the weight-based flow of materials from our products, parts, and packaging and sites waste, including Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions, across its lifecycle with Philips. From our material flow, we derive the total weight of materials put to market in the reporting year. For more information on our calculation methodologies please refer to the ESG download page. Note III Other environmental information Sustainable Operations Our Sustainable Operations program relates to improving the environmental performance of our manufacturing facilities and focus on most of the contributors to climate change, circular economy and biodiversity & ecosystem services, addressing also for example water, recycling of waste and chemical substances. Of the topics described below, water and pollution are not material topics as per the 2024 DMA. Philips Group Sustainable Sites baseline year 2020 Actual 2024 target 2025 Total CO2 from manufacturing1 0 kilotonnes 0 kilotonnes 0 kilotonnes Water withdrawal2 753,508 m3 672,608 m3 5% reduction Zero waste to landfill 2.6 % - less than 0.5% Circular Materials Management 90 % 94 % 95 % Hazardous substances emissions 2,465 kilos 1,216 kilos 25% reduction VOC emissions 79 tonnes 69 tonnes 10% reduction 1 Net carbon footprint, includes offsets 2 Baseline 2019 Water Total water withdrawal in 2024 was 672,608 m3, a 5% decrease compared with 2023 and a 11% reduction compared with 2019 (pre-COVID level). Diagnosis & Treatment, which consumes 49% of Philips’ total water usage, recorded a 3% increase, mainly caused by increased manufacturing activities at a site in Costa Rica. Personal Health recorded a 12% decrease, as a result of process improvements at our sites in the Netherlands and Indonesia. Connected Care showed a decrease of 11%, due to improvement actions at our sites in Germany and the United States. The data was restated for the reporting years 2019-2023 due to an updated groundwater withdrawal methodology in 2024. This caused a significant increase at one Personal Health site. Annually, we undertake thorough assessments of both our operational sites and strategic suppliers to address potential water-related risks. Even though not considered as material in our DMA, we recognize the importance of responsible water management. We utilize publicly accessible tools such as the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas by WRI and WWF Water Risk Filter to define and respond to these risks. This comprehensive process evaluates the vulnerability of our sites to various risks including water stress. While Philips is not a water-intensive organization, this practice ensures the uninterrupted continuity of our operations and the provision of high-quality Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) services at all our sites. Among our facilities, six locations have been identified as exposed to substantive financial and strategic risks related to water.
