"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 156 Start Climate change Strategy Disclosure Requirement E1-1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation As early as 2021, Sartorius identified key levers for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the basis of a GHG emissions screening and initiated actions to reduce them. Building on this, the company is developing an ESRS-compliant climate change mitigation transition plan in fiscal 2025. Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement E1-2 – Policies related to climate change mitigation Sartorius’ ambition is to reduce the Group’s total GHG emissions to net zero by 2045. The Corporate Sustainability department is responsible for coordinating the topic of climate change mitigation. The company has not yet drawn up a comprehensive policy that includes general management principles and guidelines and the determination of specific responsibilities, as the initial focus – prioritized in line with resource constraints – was on launching specific climate change mitigation actions. Sartorius is currently working with internal and external experts to define a formal policy in this respect. The key content of the policy will include reducing GHG emissions and improving energy efficiency by putting various levers in place. Adapting the data basis so that the company can manage the resulting actions is fundamental to the policy. Sartorius aims to complete and publish the policy in fiscal 2025. Disclosure Requirement E1-3 – Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies Sartorius has already undertaken many actions at various levels to reduce GHG emissions in order to achieve its company-wide climate targets and continued to do so in the reporting year. Examples of actions underpinning the individual levers are: ▪ Energy & infrastructure: Supply contracts are gradually being converted to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources. Where it makes sense, Sartorius is installing solar panels on its own buildings. ▪ Supply chain: Sartorius has entered into dialogue with selected suppliers to discuss and agree on ways to reduce emissions. In particular, this includes the use of renewable energy. The Group is continually extending this dialogue to other suppliers. ▪ Logistics: The company is examining opportunities for reducing emissions by changing over to less GHG-intensive means of transportation. Specifically, transportation was switched from air to sea in the fiscal year. In addition, some established supply routes were converted to electric trucks with selected partners. ▪ Eco design for packaging: Packaging is being optimized in terms of its size and weight as well as the choice of material. This includes selecting less GHG-intensive materials and switching to mono-materials."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 157 Start ▪ Eco design for products: The design of products with regard to their GHG impact is particularly challenging in the pharmaceutical sector. Nevertheless, Sartorius is facing up to the task and has already launched a number of projects in this regard – including in collaboration with customers and suppliers. In particular, the focus is on alternatives to GHG-intensive crude oil-based virgin plastic. Sartorius is unable to report on the required MDR-A disclosures at this time as the Group has not yet formalized its action plan due to resource constraints. Consequently, the actions have not yet been fully quantified, scheduled, and assigned dedicated responsibilities and financial resources. The company is currently working on these steps. The results of these activities in terms of achieved and expected GHG reductions will be presented in future reports as soon as the action plan has been finalized and a consistent methodology for measuring GHG reductions has been implemented. Aside from the taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx) presented in the section on “Disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation)”, Sartorius has not reported any further OpEx and CapEx relating to climate change mitigation for the reporting year, as its climate change mitigation action plan has not yet been defined. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E1-4 – Targets related to climate change mitigation Scope 1 and 2 The Sartorius Executive Board has decided to reduce avoidable gross Scope 1 and market-based gross Scope 2 GHG emissions to zero by 2030. Gross Scope 1 GHG emissions resulting from the use of solvents and refrigerants are considered unavoidable emissions given the current state of technology. Accordingly, avoidable emissions include all energy consumption-related emissions. As vehicle fleet emissions were not available when the target was being set and so were not included in the base year, avoidable emissions are therefore defined as all stationary emissions. Likewise, biogenic CO2 emissions were not taken into account. The aforementioned Scope 1 and 2 target is an absolute GHG reduction target measured in tons of CO2eq. In addition, the Executive Board has decided that all external electricity procurement is to come from 100% renewable sources by 2030. The above-mentioned Scope 1 and 2 targets are designed to reduce GHG emissions and consequently the company’s climate-related impacts, thereby helping Sartorius achieve its ambition of reducing GHG emissions to net zero by 2045. The targets cover the stationary energy consumption-related business activities of Sartorius in its own operations worldwide and are based on the assumption that renewable energy will actually be available at Sartorius sites in 2030. The targets are based on Sartorius’ own ambitions along with the requirements of stakeholder groups and a comparison with the political and market environment. The main lever for reducing the targeted gross Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions is the use of renewable electricity and an energy-efficient building infrastructure. If Sartorius can electrify its whole building infrastructure, these targets would be fully achievable. Reduction of CO2 emission intensity In addition to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets, Sartorius has set itself the goal of reducing total gross GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) relative to consolidated turnover in 2021. Sartorius-specific “CO2eq emission"
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 158 Start intensity” is to be reduced by an average of 10% by 2030 compared with the base year 2019. This target is integrated in the long-term remuneration components of the Executive Board, as presented in ESRS 2 GOV- 3. It is calculated from the total gross GHG emissions (see disclosure E1-6) adjusted for the GHG emissions of purchased goods and services that were not used to generate turnover in the reporting year, relative to current consolidated turnover. A relative baseline of 308 g CO2eq/EUR in 2019 calculated in this way gives a relative target of 97 g CO2eq/EUR in 2030. The relative baseline equates to an absolute baseline of 563,232 t CO2eq in 2019, and the relative target to an absolute target of 663,050 t CO2eq in 2030. In absolute terms, this means an increase in total gross GHG emissions of 18% in 2030 compared to the base year 2019. The conversion to absolute gross GHG emissions was based on the calculated CO2 emission intensity for 2030 and the anticipated consolidated turnover for 2030, multiplying the 2030 CO2 emission intensity in grams by the anticipated consolidated turnover for 2030, and converting it to tons. A growth rate of 12.5% for Group sales in the period from 2024 to 2030 was assumed. A Sartorius-specific adjustment of 10,307 t CO2eq is included in the base year and of 1,506 t Co2eq in fiscal 2024, per the GHG Protocol requirements. Sartorius has set its intensity target on the assumption of continued strong economic growth. It is based on a screening of the main GHG emission sources and the corresponding GHG reduction potentials from 2021. Scientific findings are not incorporated into the way the target is set. Without the above adjustment, the baseline for the total gross Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions is 573,539 t CO2e and the absolute target for 2030 is approximately 675,184 t CO2eq, with gross Scope 3 GHG emissions accounting for 93% of total gross GHG emissions in the base year. In Scope 3, the main lever is switching to renewable energy in the supply chain. If this lever is fully implemented, a linear increase proportional to turnover can be avoided for a large proportion of Scope 3 emissions. Evaluation of Sartorius’ climate targets No publicly recognized framework, such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), was used to set the Sartorius climate targets. This means for example that some of the requirements for emission coverage and the emission pathway specified in those frameworks are not met. Although the Scope 1 and 2 target achieves the required cross-sector reduction pathway of 46.2% according to SBTi (Sartorius: around 70%) on the basis of a rough estimate and assuming full electrification of the building infrastructure, it does not meet the required coverage of 95% (Sartorius: around 70%). The average annual reduction of 10% in Sartorius-specific CO2eq emission intensity achieves the necessary coverage of 95% (Sartorius: around 96%), but is not designed to achieve an absolute reduction in GHG emissions. Rather, the calculated absolute target figures indicate an increase in GHG emissions, meaning that the Group would not be in line with the cross-sector reduction path of 46.2% (Sartorius: +18%). In addition, basing an intensity target across all three scopes is only formally permissible if the actual scope-specific ambitions are identifiable. The Sartorius intensity target is not designed for this. As such, Sartorius’ climate targets are not science based and 1.5-degree-aligned. Sartorius’ climate targets will be revised in fiscal 2025 and submitted to the SBTi for external validation by October 2025. Year-on year changes No changes were made to the defined climate targets in the reporting year. However, the company has now specified the collection of GHG metrics."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 159 Start The calculation of GHG emissions was changed in the reporting year: ▪ In Scope°1, the GHG emissions of the vehicle fleet were recorded for the first time. ▪ In Scope°2, the emission factors for the market-based calculation were converted to residual mix factors where these were available and if there was no contract-specific emission factor. For the remaining emissions, the company is still using a location-based emission factor. ▪ In Scope°3, the data basis for calculating category 3.12 “End-of-life treatment of sold products” was harmonized with the data basis used in E5-5 to classify resource outflows. For the first time, category 3.4 “Upstream transportation and distribution” was calculated almost entirely based on primary data, and category 3.2 Capital goods entirely on the basis of the asset classes in the statement of changes in fixed assets. Furthermore, the calculated GHG emissions in category 3.15 “Investments” are included in the GHG inventory for the first time. In accordance with the Sartorius Restatement Policy, the base year was not adjusted due to the above-mentioned changes in the calculation of GHG emissions. The Restatement Policy provides for an adjustment if the cumulative effects from changes in the scope of consolidation and methodological adjustments exceed the company-specific limits (Scope 1-3 in total a maximum of 10% compared to the base year, individually Scope 1, 2 or 3 each a maximum of 15% compared to the base year). Monitoring target achievement The achievement of Sartorius’ climate targets is monitored based on the absolute GHG emissions in Scopes 1 and 2 and the Sartorius-specific intensity across Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Stationary energy consumption-related Scope 1 GHG gross emissions increased by 11% compared to the base year 2019. Market-related Scope 2 GHG gross emissions also increased by 11% compared to the base year 2019. Total adjusted gross GHG emissions increased by 23% compared to the base year 2019. The respective increases are due in particular to acquisitions and an expansion in production. The company-specific reduction in CO2 emissions intensity compared to the base year amounted to 7.8% and was therefore below the agreed target value of 10%. This is partly due to the fact that total GHG emissions have not yet been sufficiently reduced, particularly in Scope 3."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 165 Start Category Methodology Scope 1 The fuel consumption and fugitive emissions for solvents and refrigerants reported by the consolidated companies via the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Tool were multiplied by a specific emission factor. Scope 2 The consumption of electricity, heating, and cooling reported by the consolidated companies via the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Tool were multiplied by a specific emission factor. Scope 3 1 Purchased goods and services The weight or grouped operating expenditures for purchased goods and services from the business warehouse (BW) were multiplied by a specific emission factor. In the Purchased goods and services GHG category, the “CO2eq emission intensity” accounts only for the goods and services actually consumed for the manufacture of Sartorius’ products and services sold during the fiscal year. This means that the GHG emissions are adjusted for emissions from goods stored in the warehouse. 2 Capital goods The gross fixed asset additions from the financial consolidation system were multiplied by a specific emission factor. 3 Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2) The fuel and energy consumption used to calculate Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reported by the consolidated companies via the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Tool was each multiplied by specific emission factors. 4 Upstream transportation and distribution The GHG emissions for services provided were requested direct from the carriers and added together. A small proportion that could not be covered by emission reports was either extrapolated, or to a minor extent determined based on expenditure. 5 Waste generated in operations The waste reported by the consolidated companies via the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Tool was multiplied in each case by material- and disposal-specific emission factors. 6 Business travel The train, airplane and rental car routes recorded in the central travel booking system along with the number of nights spent in hotels were each multiplied by specific emission factors. Routes and nights spent in hotels that were not recorded were extrapolated based on reported data in each case and also multiplied by a specific emission factor. 7 Employee commuting The average employee commuting distance per day was determined based on an internal employee survey from 2021. The distance was then extrapolated using the number of employees in the HR system. Next, it was adjusted using the data for on-site attendance days and estimated work weeks requested from the consolidated companies. Finally, the result was multiplied by transportation-specific emission factors. 8 Upstream leased assets The category Upstream leased assets is not applicable for Sartorius and is therefore excluded. 9 Downstream transportation and distribution GHG emissions accounted for in the Downstream transportation category were multiplied by an estimated factor for the ratio of paid to unpaid transportation activities to customers. The factor was based on an estimate prepared by an external industry expert. The expert estimate is based on the ratio of paid to unpaid transportation activities to customers from an external Sartorius warehouse that was selected based on data availability. 10 Processing of sold products The category Processing of sold products is not applicable for Sartorius. Sartorius mainly sells finished products. A small part of the portfolio can be regarded as semi- finished products, but the additional processing that they undergo is highly heterogeneous. As such, the GHG profile of the additional processing cannot be clearly mapped or plausibly calculated. Sartorius refers here to the guidance in Section 6.4 of the GHG Protocol. 11 Use of sold products Turnover generated with energy-consuming product groups was multiplied by specific energy factors determined on the basis of representative products. The resulting total energy consumption of the products sold was multiplied by a global emission factor for electricity. 12 End-of-life treatment of sold products The resource outflow weight calculated for the metrics in E5-5 was used and a percentage breakdown of disposal was calculated based on historical values, which in turn was multiplied in each case by disposal-specific emission factors. 13 Downstream leased assets The category Downstream leased assets is not applicable for Sartorius and is therefore excluded. 14 Franchises The category Franchises is not applicable for Sartorius and is therefore excluded. 15 Investments The Scope 1 and 2 emissions were extrapolated based on the head counts of the affiliates concerned, using Sartorius data."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 166 Start CO2 emission intensity is calculated from the total gross GHG emissions in E1-6, adjusted for the GHG emissions for purchased goods and services that were not used to generate turnover in the reporting year, relative to current consolidated turnover. The GHG accounting was carried out in the company’s Corporate Sustainability Tool, which is also used by the company to collect and consolidate its environmental and occupational safety-related figures. Sartorius has been using this software from a market leader for many years. Among other things, it provides the necessary emission factors for a corporate carbon footprint. The emission factors used provide the necessary country- specific granularity for the market- and location-based calculation methods and for the emissions from nights spent in hotels, for example. Another reason for using listed factors is that Sartorius relies on spend-based factors in some categories. The listed emission factor databases have provided some specific spend-based factors that, for example, covered our expenditure profile well. The table below provides a summary of the emission factors used. The emissions factors took account of all CO2 equivalents except for the AIB factors, which only include pure CO2 emissions.

Validation: There is no external validation of the metrics as a whole or the individual components. Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances: Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty: As described earlier, some Scope 3 GHG categories were calculated using estimates. ▪ 1 Purchased goods and services: Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated mainly on the basis of expenditures, with only a small portion based on the actual weight of purchased goods and services."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 167 Start ▪ 2 Capital goods: Here, emissions were calculated entirely on the basis of expenditures, i.e., without data from life cycle assessments of the capital goods. ▪ 9 Downstream transportation: Here, the emissions were estimated entirely on the basis of an expert opinion. ▪ 11 Use of sold products: The emissions were not measured by the actual energy consumption of the products, but calculated based on the estimated consumption of typical products. ▪ 12 End-of-life treatment of sold products: The emissions were based entirely on assumptions about global waste disposal, as no information was available on how customers actually disposed of the products Given the many estimates and assumptions involved, Sartorius currently treats the GHG emissions calculated on the basis of the methodologies described above as merely an indication. The GHG accounting will gradually be specified in more detail in the coming years so as to enable better management of emissions. In particular, this will involve switching from the spend-based calculation method to a more specific driver-based calculation method. Disclosure Requirement E1-7 – GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits In the reporting period, Sartorius did not develop any projects for the removal or storage of greenhouse gases, nor did it contribute to any such projects in the upstream or downstream value chain. Please also note that the company did not purchase or plan to purchase any carbon credits during this period. As such, no emission reductions or removals were financed or intended to be financed by climate change mitigation projects outside the value chain. Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing No internal carbon pricing schemes were used or implemented in the reporting period. As such, there are no internal shadow prices, carbon fees or carbon funds that influenced decision-making or provided incentives for implementing climate-related policies and targets. Disclosure requirement E1-9 – Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks This disclosure is not currently relevant for Sartorius because no material physical risks or transition risks were identified in the reporting year."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 168 Start Pollution Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement E2-1 – Policies related to pollution Compliance with local environmental protection laws and requirements is a core component of the Sartorius Group-wide Code of Conduct. Sartorius also endeavors to go above and beyond legal requirements in countries where the company operates and to minimize the environmental impacts of its business activities. Responsibility for this lies with the Sartorius sites, which have put in place corresponding management systems for this purpose. These systems not only guarantee legal compliance but also promote continuous improvement in environmental performance. They also use procedural instructions to govern the handling of hazardous substances at Sartorius sites as well as emergency planning for unexpected events such as sudden pollution, an accident or a natural disaster. Some of these systems are externally certified to the recognized ISO 14001 standard. To ensure that suppliers also take responsibility, Sartorius’ Code of Conduct for Business Partners requires that its business partners have an appropriate environmental protection management system in place and take appropriate environmental protection measures. The current policy at Sartorius is not yet coordinated and monitored Group-wide. The company is currently working with internal and external experts to develop and formalize a policy in this respect that will include definitions of general management principles and guidelines and the determination of specific responsibilities. Sartorius aims to complete and publish the policy in fiscal 2025. Disclosure Requirement E2-2 – Actions and resources related to pollution The Sartorius Group’s environmentally sensitive sites pursue environmental protection independently and provide the necessary human and financial resources. Preventing pollution caused by the use of hazardous substances is a particular priority. High volumes of hazardous substances are required in membrane production. So, for example, distillation plants are operated at the relevant sites in Göttingen, Germany, and Yauco, Puerto Rico so as to almost fully recycle the solvents in the production water and enable them to be reused. Non-recyclable solvent residues are disposed of professionally by contracted service providers. In accordance with official approvals, production wastewater is discharged into the sewage system or undergoes further treatment by external service providers. In addition, Sartorius provides transparency both locally and centrally about the hazardous substances it purchases and their use in the final products. In line with the EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) or other equivalent regulations on international markets, hazardous substances are managed and customers are informed about hazardous substances in products. Suppliers’ compliance with environmental protection requirements is monitored by self-assessments and audits under Sartorius’ human rights due diligence system. The company refers to its explanations in S2-1. The actions specified are ongoing, without a fixed time horizon. The company is currently working on formalizing its actions by scoping strategic targets, i.e. quantified actions with defined time-horizons and"
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 169 Start responsibilities and the requisite financial resources along with specific effectiveness monitoring. As such, the company cannot provide disclosures on financial resources at present. Likewise, achieved and expected progress on pollution as a result of these actions can also be presented in future reports as soon as a consistent methodology for measuring progress is in place. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E2-3 – Targets related to pollution The company has not yet set any Group-wide targets for pollution. This is because existing management is decentralized. In formalizing the pollution prevention policy, the company is working on setting up measurable, time-bound and outcome-oriented targets, including metrics to measure effectiveness for the entire Group. The company has decided not to define Group-wide targets at present as it is concentrating on the core development and implementation of policies and actions that address the main impacts, risks and opportunities relating to environmental pollution, such as the use of hazardous substances. Disclosure Requirement E2-5 – Substances of concern and substances of very high concern In the reporting year, the total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that were generated, used or procured during production (inflow amount) was 879 t. Most of this was reprotoxic or carcinogenic. The total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that left the company’s facilities in the form of emissions, products or as part of products or services (outflow amount) was 288 t. Most of this was carcinogenic (199 t). The difference between the inflow and outflow is mainly due to the fact that Sartorius sends a certain solvent to a recycling company for treatment after several usage cycles, then repurchases it.

Likewise, achieved and expected progress on pollution as a result of these actions can also be presented in future reports as soon as a consistent methodology for measuring progress is in place. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E2-3 – Targets related to pollution The company has not yet set any Group-wide targets for pollution. This is because existing management is decentralized. In formalizing the pollution prevention policy, the company is working on setting up measurable, time-bound and outcome-oriented targets, including metrics to measure effectiveness for the entire Group. The company has decided not to define Group-wide targets at present as it is concentrating on the core development and implementation of policies and actions that address the main impacts, risks and opportunities relating to environmental pollution, such as the use of hazardous substances. Disclosure Requirement E2-5 – Substances of concern and substances of very high concern In the reporting year, the total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that were generated, used or procured during production (inflow amount) was 879 t. Most of this was reprotoxic or carcinogenic. The total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that left the company’s facilities in the form of emissions, products or as part of products or services (outflow amount) was 288 t. Most of this was carcinogenic (199 t). The difference between the inflow and outflow is mainly due to the fact that Sartorius sends a certain solvent to a recycling company for treatment after several usage cycles, then repurchases it.

"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 172 Start Resource use and circular economy Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement E5-1 – Policies related to resource use and circular economy Developing an approach to the sustainable use of resources is a complex challenge for Sartorius as a supplier to the biopharmaceutical industry. It requires the Group to harmonize various matters including sustainability but also quality, safety and efficiency requirements. For several reasons and based on various advantages, plastic-based single-use products from primary fossil feedstock, such as bags and filters, were introduced in the biopharmaceutical industry in the early 1990s. First, they help to reduce the risk of contamination that exists in stainless steel systems due to sometimes inefficient cleaning. They are also more flexible and so can be deployed more quickly in production facilities. As such, single-use technologies can speed up time-to- market for new treatments. But by law, single-use products normally have to be incinerated as contaminated waste at the end of their life. This means that recycling them is not possible as things stand in terms of current industry practice and infrastructure. These technologies are highly relevant to Sartorius’ business volume, accounting for around 60–70% of turnover. Sartorius firmly believes that it can improve resource use and circular economy factors relating to these products along the value chain. The Executive Board therefore reaffirmed its ambitions for this at the beginning of 2024, and discussed targets for managing it. In particular, this entails eco design, decoupling materials use from fossil feedstock, increasing the recyclability of products and avoiding operational landfill waste. The company has not yet drawn up a policy that includes general management principles and guidelines and the determination of specific responsibilities. Due to resource constraints, the Corporate Sustainability department is tackling topics one by one, with an initial focus on climate issues in line with the high level of internal and external interest.

"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 175 Start Disclosure Requirement E5-5 - Resource outflows Sartorius’ resource outflows are classified as products and waste. Key product categories include consumables and instruments (e.g., electronic products). The company does not currently manufacture any products that are explicitly designed according to circular principles. A large part of the product portfolio, the consumables, is in fact explicitly intended for single use due to legal requirements concerning quality and subsequent disposal by the customer. However, electronic products already address sustainability matters in that they are repairable and durable. In line with the European WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU, old appliances in the EU must also be taken back by Sartorius or by authorized partners and sent for recycling. In continuing to formalize its policy and actions on resource use and circular economy, Sartorius will examine additional possibilities for developing products according to circular principles. The expected durability of the products placed on the market by Sartorius relative to the industry average varies by product group. In the instruments product category, the expected durability of the products that Sartorius places on the market is 9 years on average. Larger biopharmaceutical devices last up to 15 years. Sartorius is not aware of the industry average and hence cannot make a statement on durability relative to the industry average. Services are used to increase the durability of sold products. However, as Sartorius offers a large number of repair and maintenance services, the company cannot make a blanket statement on increasing the durability of Group’s products. As regards repairability, Sartorius attaches particular importance to ensuring that its instruments are easy to repair. This includes the long-term provision of spare parts to extend the service life of the products and so minimize their environmental footprint. The products sold by Sartorius had an estimated recyclable content of 16%. This percentage relates to the instruments product category, where adhesive joints are largely avoided so that the individual parts can be easily separated and thus recycled. This supports the goal of a circular economy and reduces the environmental impacts of the products. In addition, 18% of the packaging is made from recyclable materials, which helps to reduce waste and conserve resources. Operational waste amounted to 8,550 t in the reporting year. Of this, 4,625 t were diverted from disposal and 3,924 t were sent for disposal, respectively accounting for 54% and 46% of total waste. The waste diverted from disposal breaks down as follows: Hazardous waste totaled 1,951 t. Of this, 0 t was sent for preparation for reuse, 556 t for recycling and 0 t for other recovery processes. Non-hazardous waste totaled 4,069 t. Of this, 29 t was sent for preparation for reuse, 4,040 t for recycling and 0 t for other recovery processes. The waste destined for disposal breaks down as follows: Hazardous waste totaled 1,395 t. Of this, 1,254 t was sent for incineration, 0 t to landfill and 140 t for other methods of disposal. Non-hazardous waste totaled 2,530 t. Of this, 750 t was sent for incineration, 977 t to landfill and 802 t for other methods of disposal. The total amount of non-recycled waste amounted to 3,925 t and accounted for 46% of total waste. The main types of waste in relevant sector-specific waste streams included hazardous waste (23%) and residual waste (22%). Other categories were waste paper (16%), plastic waste (15%), wood waste (10%) and other waste (15%)."

"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 177 Start Disclosures on preparation of metrics Definitions: ▪ Product durability: The expected durability of products is the expected ability of a product to remain functional and relevant when used as intended. ▪ Recyclable percentage: The recyclable percentage in products and packaging refers to product content that can be sent for technical recycling. ▪ Waste: Waste is defined as the weight of accumulated waste since the beginning of the year, broken down into waste diverted from disposal and waste destined for disposal as well as hazardous and non-hazardous waste, specified according to the treatment method used in each case. Hazardous waste is also classified on the basis of national regulations. Methodology: The calculation of the recyclable percentage in product packaging is based on the data for purchased packaging, with the assumption that the purchased amounts equal the sold amounts and are not stored in warehouses. The calculation multiplies the net weight of the packaging by the purchased amount. Where no net weight is available, the weight is calculated using a self-determined weighting factor. For parts of the company that are not covered by the system, the purchased material is extrapolated. The recyclable percentage in products equates to the percentage from the instruments product group. Durability is determined by interviewing experts on typical instruments in each business area and calculating an average. Waste disclosures are prepared based on the reports submitted by the individual consolidated Group companies via the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Tool. The data reports are generally based on invoices. If the corresponding invoices are not available locally, the data are estimated using site-specific methodologies (e.g., historical data or averages). Validation: There is no external validation of the metrics as a whole or the individual components. Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances: Disclosures on value chain estimation: The metrics for the recyclable percentage in products and packaging include estimated data from the upstream value chain. In the specific case, some net weights were calculated as described above, with self-calculated weighting factors. Sartorius is continuously working on improving its data processes. Disclosures on sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty: As described above, part of the calculated total weight of the total resource outflow is based on an estimate of the net weight of the components, products and materials sold for the calculation of the recyclable portion of the products. The estimated proportion of products relates to the instruments product group, in which adhesive joints are largely dispensed with so that the individual parts are easily separable and therefore recyclable. The expected durability of products and the recyclable content in products are based on internal expert estimates. The recyclable portion of product packaging is also calculated on the assumption that the product packaging purchased corresponds to the product packaging sold, as no large stocks of packaging material"

Social information Own workforce To ensure consistent reporting, the terms workforce, employees and non-employees are defined as follows and unless explicitly stated otherwise, are used consistently throughout the Statement. The company’s own workforce comprises employees and non-employees. Taking into account the national law of the parent company, the active core workforce of the consolidated Group companies is counted as employees in accordance with the definition in the German HGB. Accordingly, the following groups are excluded from the count: employees in training, employees on leave, employees on long-term absence, temporary workers and members of the Executive Board. Non-employees are contingent workers who work for but are not employed by Sartorius and are therefore excluded from payroll. At Sartorius, these are generally leasing workers. Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement S1-1 – Policies related to own workforce In the reporting year, Sartorius identified actual, positive impacts on its own workforce that help to boost satisfaction, loyalty and retention and so increase the recruitment and retention of skilled employees. These positive impacts concern working conditions and equal treatment and opportunities for all. This includes secure employment, working time, adequate wages, social dialogue, freedom of association, the existence of works councils and the information, consultation and participation rights of workers, collective bargaining, work-life balance, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, training and skills development, employment and inclusion of persons with disabilities, and diversity. At the same time, potential negative impacts with regard to health and safety as well as violence and harassment in the workplace were identified. For this reason, Sartorius is pursuing policies and standards to make working conditions and equal treatment and opportunities in the Group attractive, and to prevent adverse impacts on the workforce. Core components of the policy include the Sartorius Code of Conduct as well as the corresponding position statements on labor and social standards and on occupational health and safety, which define a common understanding of good, fair, healthy and safe working conditions within the Group. Another component is the policy statement on respect for human rights, in which the company states that it respects and promotes internationally recognized human and labor rights. This includes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. All employees, the public, rights holders and suppliers as well as all other stakeholders of the company can access the policy statement in English on the Sartorius website. Sartorius employees can also access it via the intranet. The Corporate Sustainability department is responsible for the position statements as well as the policy statement on respect for human rights. Operational management is responsible for implementation in each case. Policies are implemented via operational process descriptions and the relevant management systems. Responsibility for implementation monitoring has not yet been officially delegated to a department."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 180 Start Human rights compliance monitoring is managed in particular via a specific risk management system in accordance with the requirements of the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, LkSG). The organizational structure is based on the three lines model and applies to all controlled entities of the Sartorius Group. The first line comprises the functions responsible for day-to-day business. Its task is to identify, analyze and manage operational risks relating to violations of human rights, labor standards, occupational health and safety and environmental protection. The management of human and environmental impacts, risks and opportunities is embedded in all relevant business processes and functions, to ensure an appropriate and effective response to the dynamic, ongoing assessment of human rights and environmental impacts. Relevant functions in this context include Corporate Sourcing, Environment, Health, Safety & Security and Human Resources. The first line is tasked with executing operational risk management procedures with clear responsibilities and processes. The analyses of abstract (i.e., country and industry) and actual risks are pooled – partly using artificial intelligence – by Corporate Sourcing for the supply chain and by Corporate Sustainability for each division. Sartorius also leverages synergies with existing management systems and certifications when undertaking the analyses. The first line is supported by second-line functions. As a second-line function, the Human Rights Officer works jointly with Corporate Compliance to monitor overall compliance with defined processes. The Human Rights Officer evaluates the appropriateness and effectiveness of the first line’s risk management systems. The evaluation results are reported to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board on an annual and ad hoc basis as required, along with recommendations for remedial action. The Human Rights Officer’s reporting duties are set out in detail in a corresponding delegation letter, which requires the Human Rights Officer to regularly – at least once a year – inform the entire Executive Board of Sartorius AG about her activities in this role. In addition, she must immediately inform the CEO of urgent or particularly significant cases, such as (impending) violations of protected legal interests that require remedial action, or changes in situational risk that necessitate adjustments to risk management. Internal Audit is the third line of defense and regularly conducts risk-based audits of human rights and environmental risk management. Workforce-related policies are in line with the internationally recognized procedural standards of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Compliance with the principles, rights and standards set out in the Sartorius policy statement is monitored under the compliance management system and verified by regular internal and external audits. The workforce itself is also closely involved in monitoring compliance with the policy and standards set out in the statement, and can report violations to the relevant manager, workers’ representatives, the Compliance Officer or via the compliance or whistleblowing hotline, as well as anonymously via the whistleblower portal. If substantiated human rights violations are identified, the company will work with the workforce and/or their representatives to determine appropriate remedial action. For further information on grievance management and remediation, the company refers to the disclosures in S1-3. The policy statement on respect for human rights covers human trafficking, forced labor and child labor. Requirements for safety in research and development and in applications, hazardous substances, ergonomics and mental health, including the prevention of work-related accidents, are covered by the global standard for occupational safety and specified in corresponding processes and management systems. The promotion of equal opportunities and the elimination of discrimination are written into in the Code of Conduct and the policy statement on respect for human rights.
