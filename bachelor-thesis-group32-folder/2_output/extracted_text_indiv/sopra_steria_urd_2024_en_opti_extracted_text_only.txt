"300 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.2. Carrying amount of investments in associates This note supplements the description of transactions set out in Note 2.2. The sale of most of the activities of Sopra Banking Software involved the transfer by the Group to Sopra GMT of 3.619 million of the 6.914 million shares it held in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). The sale was completed on 19 July 2024. It brought the Group’s stake in 74Software to around 15%. As part of the same transaction, the Group sold to Sopra GMT all its pre-emptive subscription rights to 74Software shares. As the latter funded the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software, in particular through a capital increase, the Group’s stake was diluted and only amounted to 11.1% following this transaction. The Group no longer exerts significant influence over 74Software, and the 74Software shares were reclassified under Non‐consolidated securities as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.A €11.1 million profit from sale of business, recognised in Other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.2.3), reflecting the loss of significant influence. The sale of pre-emptive subscription rights, in the amount of €10.2 million, is recognised in equity as an item not reclassifiable to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Through this operation, the Group received €106.2 million, including €10.2 million for the sale of pre-emptive subscription rights and €95.9 million for the sale of 3.619 million 74Software shares. As the sale of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares falls within the scope of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, they are no longer measured using the equity method. Accordingly, no profit from 74Software associated with the shares that were sold was recognised. The carrying amount of investments in associates consisted mainly of the value of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares until the date on which they were sold, with the remaining shares recognised under Non-consolidated securities. It changed as follows: (in millions of euros) Carrying amount 31 December 2022 183.5 Changes in scope 0.2 Dividend distribution -2.7 Profit for the period 6.7 Translation adjustments -2.3 Other comprehensive income -0.4 Other movements 0.8 31 December 2023 185.9 Changes in scope -190.3 Dividend distribution - Profit for the period -6.7 Translation adjustments 2.2 Other comprehensive income 0.0 Other movements 9.9 31 DECEMBER 2024 1.0 At 31 December 2023, Sopra Steria Group held a 31.96% stake in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). This stake did not give the Group a controlling interest in this subsidiary and did not allow it to involve itself in the running of the business or influence variable returns from this subsidiary. The Group thus exercised significant influence. Recognition and impairment of investments in associates Investments in associates are initially recognised at acquisition cost, and their value is then adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of their net assets. The remainder of this share appears under Equity-accounted investments on the asset side of the balance sheet. Its change over the financial year is recognised in profit or loss within Net profit from associates. Equity-accounted shares in a company constitute a single asset and must be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill on associates is included in the value of equity- accounted investments, the value of which is measured inclusive of goodwill. As such, goodwill on associates must not be tested for impairment separately. At each balance sheet date, where there is an indication of impairment of an investment in an associate, the parent company must carry out an impairment test consisting of comparing the carrying amount of the relevant equity- accounted investment with its recoverable amount. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is the higher of its value in use, calculated on the basis of future cash flows, and the fair value of the investment less costs of disposal. Where an associate’s shares are listed, fair value less costs of disposal is equal to market price less costs to sell: in the absence of any firm sale agreement, this is the price at which the shares are currently trading. Any impairment losses are charged to profit or loss as Other operating income and expenses. Where there is an improvement in the recoverable amount of an equity-accounted investment such that the impairment loss may be written back, the full amount of the impairment loss, including the portion relating to goodwill, must be written back."
"303 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Net cash and cash equivalents include available liquid funds (cash at bank and in hand), liquid marketable securities that meet the definition of cash equivalents, bills of exchange presented for collection and falling due before the balance sheet date, and temporary bank overdrafts. Net debt, as presented in Note 12.3, is more representative of the Group’s financial position. Marketable securities and other short-term investments include money-market holdings, short-term deposits and advances under the liquidity agreement. The risk of a change in value on these investments is negligible. Of the €423.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding current bank overdrafts) at 31 December 2024, €323.2 million was held by the parent company and €100.1 million by the subsidiaries. Among the subsidiaries, entities in India contributed €36.0 million to net cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 (versus €25.5 million at 31 December 2023). Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank demand deposits, other highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities as part of Financial debt – Short-term portion. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, with the exception of foreign exchange impacts. UCITS classified by the AMF (France’s financial markets regulator) as belonging to the “money market fund” and “short-term money market fund” categories are, for practical purposes, presumed to automatically meet all four quoted eligibility criteria. Other cash UCITS cannot be presumed to be eligible for classification as “cash equivalents”: an analysis must be carried out to establish whether or not the four quoted criteria are met. Cash equivalents are recognised at fair value; changes in fair value are charged to profit or loss under Cost of net financial debt. 12.3.

Borrowings are subsequently recognised at amortised cost; any difference between the capital amounts borrowed (net of transaction costs) and the amounts repayable is recognised in profit or loss over the duration of the borrowings using the effective interest method; ■NEU CP short-term negotiable securities, which have a maturity of less than 12 months and are recognised at amortised cost; ■NEU MTN medium-term negotiable securities, which have maturities spread over one to five years from issuance, and are recognised at amortised cost; ■current bank overdrafts. Financial debt repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date is classified as current liabilities. 12.3.1. Bonds On 5 July 2019, the Group issued a €250 million bond to top-ranking institutional investors. The bond has two tranches: a 7-year €130 million bond with a fixed annual coupon of 1.749%, and an 8-year €120 million tranche with a fixed annual coupon of 2.0%."
"306 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.5. Financial risk management 12.5.1. Liquidity risk The Group’s policy is to have credit facilities at its disposal that are much larger than its needs and to manage cash centrally at Group level where permitted by local law. Moreover, subsidiaries’ cash surpluses or borrowing requirements are managed centrally, being invested or met by the Sopra Steria Group parent company, which carries the bulk of the Group’s borrowings and bank credit facilities. As part of its efforts to diversify its borrowings, the Group has a €300 million NEU MTN programme to supplement its €700 million NEU CP programme launched in 2015. In 2024, the amounts received from the sale of Sopra Banking Software and 74Software (€416.7 million) were used to fund the share buyback programme (€106.9 million), gradually reduce the amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme and make investments in the form of certificates of deposit maturing in less than three months with members of the banking syndicate. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme was €99.0 million at 31 December 2024 (€366.0 million in December 2023). Bilateral credit facilities were in place for a total of €92.0 million, with maturities in 2028. At 31 December 2024, they were drawn down in the amount of €67.0 million. At 31 December 2024, the Group had credit facilities totalling €1,978 million, 34% of which was drawn down. Undrawn available credit lines amounted to €1,302 million (€1,100 million in RCFs and €25 million in bilateral credit facilities), in addition to undrawn overdraft facilities for €177 million. Aside from the syndicated loan, bilateral credit facilities and bonds, the Group’s financing essentially consists of issues under NEU CP (short-term commercial paper) and NEU MTN programmes. These financing sources break down as shown below: (in millions of euros) Amount authorised at 31/12/2024 Drawdown at 31/12/ 2024 Drawdown Repayment terms Interest rate at 31/ 12/2024 €m £m €m £m Bond 250.0 - 250.0 - 100% At maturity €130m 07/2026 €120m 07/2027 1.87% Syndicated loan ■Multi-currency revolving credit facility 1,100.0 - - 0% 02/2029 * ■Bank borrowings 344.0 344.0 - 100% Amortising tranche of €224m & tranche due at maturity of €120m, maturing 12/ 2028 4.09% Bilateral credit facilities 92.0 67.0 73% 2026 to 2028 4.62% Other 15.6 15.6 - 100% 2025 to 2026 3.01% Overdraft 176.5 - 0.0 N/A Total credit facilities authorised per currency 1,978.1 - 676.6 - TOTAL CREDIT FACILITIES AUTHORISED (€ EQUIVALENT) 1,978.1 676.6 34% 3.30% Other types of financing used NEU CP & NEU MTN 119.0 2025 4.02% Other 10.0 2025 Total financing per currency 805.5 - TOTAL FINANCING (€ EQUIVALENT) 805.5 3.36% * The two one‐year extension options were exercised and unanimously approved by lenders in February 2023 and December 2023. Interest rates payable on the syndicated loan equal the interbank rate of the currency concerned at the time of drawdown (minimum 0%), plus a margin set for a period of six months based on the leverage ratio. The €250 million bond issued on 5 July 2019 has an effective interest rate of 1.749% for the €130 million tranche and 2% for the €120 million tranche. The bond issue is subject to terms and conditions, which include financial covenants. Two financial ratios are calculated every six months using the consolidated financial statements on a 12-month rolling basis: ■the first – known as the leverage ratio – is equal to net financial debt divided by pro forma EBITDA; ■the second – known as the interest coverage ratio – is equal to pro forma EBITDA divided by the cost of net financial debt. The first financial ratio must not exceed 3.0 at any reporting date. The second ratio must not fall below 5.0. Net financial debt is defined on a consolidated basis as all loans and related borrowings (excluding intercompany liabilities and lease liabilities), less available cash and cash equivalents. Pro forma EBITDA is Consolidated operating profit on business activity adding back depreciation, amortisation and provisions included in Operating profit on business activity before the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (see Note 1.6.1). It is calculated on a 12-month rolling basis and is therefore restated so as to be presented in the financial statements at constant scope over 12 months."

"100 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of company officers Lastly, in the event of exceptional circumstances (such as an exogenous shock) leading to the suspension of the normal system of variable compensation for employees and Group Executive Committee members, the Compensation Committee would review the situation of the Chief Executive Officer. It could recommend to the Board of Directors that it ask the shareholders at the General Meeting to approve the addition of a bonus to the Chief Executive Officer’s variable compensation if that would serve the Company’s interests, subject to an upper limit of 60% of his annual fixed compensation. Long-term incentive plans are based on awarding rights to shares. They are subject to the condition of being with the Company over a period of time and performance conditions. The targets are set in the same way as for variable compensation. Independently of the compensation policy, the Company covers or reimburses company officers’ travel expenses (transportation and accommodation). The procedure for determining compensation policy applicable to executive company officers and the timing of that procedure are intended to ensure that all useful information is taken into account when recommendations are drawn up and when the Board of Directors makes its final decision. This ensures that such decisions are consistent among themselves and aligned with the Company’s strategy. The Nomination, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee have one member in common. The compensation policy applies to newly appointed company officers. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as to enable the replacement or appointment of a new executive company officer, the Board of Directors may waive application of the compensation policy. Such waivers must be temporary, aligned with the Company’s interests and necessary to secure the Company’s long-term success or viability. Furthermore, this option may only be adopted where there is consensus among the members of the Board of Directors as to the decision to be taken (i.e. no votes against). This may result in the awarding of items of compensation currently defined in the compensation policy as not applicable (severance pay, non-compete payment, supplementary pension plan). These items would be put to the vote at the following General Meeting. 2.2. Executive company officers The compensation policy for executive company officers was subject to recommendations made by the Compensation Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 26 February 2025. The compensation policy and any variable and exceptional items of compensation must be approved at the General Meeting prior to their payment. 2.2.1. COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors, subject to approval at the General Meeting ITEMS OF COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Items of compensation Comments Annual fixed compensation Set by the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation by the Compensation Committee Annual variable compensation Not applicable Deferred variable compensation Not applicable Multi-year variable compensation Not applicable Deferment periods; option of asking for variable compensation to be returned Not applicable Exceptional compensation Possible, by decision of the Board of Directors, but contingent upon very specific circumstances with substantial consequences on the role and activity of the Chairman of the Board of Directors Payment subject to shareholder approval of all items of compensation at an Ordinary General Meeting and in all circumstances capped at 100% of annual fixed compensation Stock options, performance shares and any other long-term items of compensation Not applicable Compensation referred to in Article L. 22-10-14 of the French Commercial Code Application of Directors’ compensation policy Any other benefits Company car Severance pay/benefit payable upon change of duties Not applicable Non-compete payment Not applicable Supplementary pension plan Not applicable"

"304 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.3.2. Bank borrowings On 22 February 2022, the Group signed an agreement with its partner banks consisting of a €1,100 million non-amortising multi-currency credit facility tied to the achievement of environmental goals. Its ESG component does not constitute an embedded derivative. It is based on achieving a greenhouse gas emissions reduction aligned with a 1.5°C temperature increase scenario validated by SBTi for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and part of Scope 3. The target is to achieve a 68% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per employee by 2028 relative to a 2015 baseline. It is measured for each financial year and, if the target is met, will result in a 0.04% reduction per year in the applicable margin. In addition, the Company undertakes to pay an annual contribution equivalent to 0.04% of the margin applicable to sustainable projects, irrespective of whether it reaches the target. The Group’s achievement of its environmental performance targets in 2022 and 2023 made it possible to establish a dedicated fund of more than €0.2 million to fund innovative technology projects aimed at combating climate change. This agreement, with an initial term of five years, included two options to extend the expiry date by one year, exercised at the end of 2022 and 2023. The maturity of this credit facility is now set at 22 February 2029. At end-December 2024, this credit facility was undrawn. On 19 December 2023, the Group signed a contract with the same partner banks for a bank credit facility, drawn in the amount of €400 million, with a term of five years, comprised of a €280 million amortising tranche and a €120 million non- amortising tranche. This bank credit facility does not include an ESG component. Its balance at 31 December 2024 stood at €344.0 million. The Group also has several non-amortising bilateral bank facilities: some drawn to €67 million and others undrawn for €25 million, maturing in 2028. 12.3.3. Other financial debt In 2015, the Group arranged an unrated multi-currency NEU CP programme of short-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, in a maximum amount of €700 million. This programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was last updated in July 2024. The Group actively issued securities in 2024 and the average amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme grew, totalling €379.1 million in 2024, compared with €392.7 million in 2023. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme at 31 December 2024 was €99.0 million (€366.0 million at 31 December 2023), including floating-rate NEU CP amounting to €60.0 million and fixed-rate NEU CP amounting to €39.0 million. The NEU CPs are included in Other sundry financial debt. In December 2017, the Group arranged an NEU MTN programme of medium-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, with a maximum amount of €300 million. As was the case for the earlier NEU CP programme, the NEU MTN programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was updated in July 2024. The NEU MTN programme pays fixed or floating rates, with a spread at each issue date. Maturities range from one to five years. At 31 December 2024, the outstanding amount under the NEU MTN programme was €20.0 million, maturing in November 2025 (€10.0 million at 31 December 2023). The NEU MTNs are included in Other sundry financial debt. 12.4.

All financial instruments in this category are financial assets and liabilities classified as such upon first recognition. Financial debt is recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate. Hedging instruments may be put in place to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates by swapping part of the Group’s floating-rate debt for fixed-rate debt. The Group has entered into and continues to implement transactions designed to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk through the use of derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options as well as over-the- counter instruments with top-tier counterparties, as part of its overall risk management policy and due to the substantial scale of its production activities in India, Poland and Tunisia."

The remainder corresponds to customer disputes, primarily in France, for €2.4 million. Provisions for tax risks other than income tax mainly concern risks relating to the R&D tax credit in France. Provisions for restructuring correspond to the cost of one-off restructuring measures, mainly in Germany (€0.9 million) and France (€1.7 million). Other provisions for contingencies mainly cover risks relating to clients and projects in the amount of €29.3 million (including €12.2 million in the United Kingdom, €7.9 million in France and €8.5 million in Germany), contractual risks (€6.8 million) and employee‐related risks (€4.2 million). Present obligations resulting from past events involving third parties are recognised in provisions only when it is probable that such obligations will give rise to an outflow of resources to third parties without consideration from said parties that is at least equivalent, and if the outflow of resources can be reliably measured. Since provisions are estimated based on future risks and expenses, such amounts include an element of uncertainty and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. The impact of discounting provisions is taken into account if significant. In the specific case of restructuring, an obligation is recognised as soon as the restructuring has been publicly announced and a detailed plan presented or the plan implementation has commenced. This cost mainly corresponds to severance payments, early retirement, costs related to notice periods not worked, training costs for departing employees and other costs relating to site closures. A provision is recognised for the rent and related costs to be paid, net of estimated subleasing income, in respect of any property if the asset is subleased or vacant and is not intended to be used in connection with main activities. Scrapped assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. 11.2. Contingent liabilities The contingent liabilities recognised arose as a result of the Sopra-Steria business combination in 2014. At 31 December 2024, they totalled €6.0 million after tax, corresponding to tax and contractual risks in India. To the extent that a liability is not probable or may not be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed by the Group among its commitments given. By exception, in connection with business combinations, the Group may recognise a contingent liability on the balance sheet if it results from a present obligation arising from past events and its fair value can be reliably estimated, even where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to extinguish the obligation."
