"298 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Property, plant and equipment essentially consists of land and buildings, fixtures and fittings, office furniture and equipment, and IT equipment. Property, plant and equipment is measured at acquisition cost (excluding any borrowing costs) less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. No amounts have been remeasured. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of each of the following fixed asset categories: ■buildings: 25 to 30 years; ■fixtures and fittings: 4 to 10 years; ■IT hardware and equipment: 3 to 8 years; ■vehicles: 4 to 5 years; ■office furniture and equipment: 4 to 10 years. Depreciation is applied against assets’ acquisition cost after deducting any residual value. Assets’ residual values and expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

"299 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Leases Leases are recognised in the balance sheet at the lease commencement date, which corresponds to the date at which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee, and results in the recognition of a balance sheet asset within Right-of-use assets and a liability within Lease liabilities. The value of lease liabilities corresponds to the present value of minimum future payments, discounted over the lease term using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or otherwise the incremental borrowing rate of the entity leasing the asset. The lease term chiefly reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease. The Group may adjust it, where it considers this to be reasonable, to reflect the period of a renewal or an extension option, which could be exercised, or an early termination option, which could be invoked where the corresponding penalties (contractual penalties and economic costs of doing so) would be more than negligible. At the lease commencement date, the value of the right-of- use asset recognised in the balance sheet corresponds to the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease, prepaid lease payments, incentives received from the lessor at that date, or costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset. Minimum future payments include fixed lease payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option, and termination or non-renewal penalties if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise or not exercise these options. Some of these values may change over the term of the lease, in which case the values of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are revised upward or downward. They do not include any service components that may be included in the lease, which continue to be recognised as expenses. In the balance sheet, Lease liabilities are split out into non- current and current portions. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset if the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee, or if the lessee is reasonably certain of exercising a purchase option. In the income statement, these amortisation expenses are included within Depreciation, amortisation, provisions and impairment under Operating profit on business activity. The Net interest expense on lease liabilities is split out from the line item Other financial income and expenses. Finally, as an exception, short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (individual value less than 5,000 USD) are directly recognised as expenses and are therefore not restated in the balance sheet. Variable lease payments are also recognised as expenses according to the use or revenue generated by the use of the underlying asset. 9.2. Breakdown of lease liabilities by maturity The lease amortisation schedule is as follows: (in millions of euros) Value of contractual flows Current Non-current Breakdown of non-current portion 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years More than 5 years LEASE LIABILITIES 475.4 115.2 360.2 94.1 71.1 49.1 40.7 105.1 NOTE 10 EQUITY‐ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 10.1.

"300 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.2. Carrying amount of investments in associates This note supplements the description of transactions set out in Note 2.2. The sale of most of the activities of Sopra Banking Software involved the transfer by the Group to Sopra GMT of 3.619 million of the 6.914 million shares it held in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). The sale was completed on 19 July 2024. It brought the Group’s stake in 74Software to around 15%. As part of the same transaction, the Group sold to Sopra GMT all its pre-emptive subscription rights to 74Software shares. As the latter funded the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software, in particular through a capital increase, the Group’s stake was diluted and only amounted to 11.1% following this transaction. The Group no longer exerts significant influence over 74Software, and the 74Software shares were reclassified under Non‐consolidated securities as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.A €11.1 million profit from sale of business, recognised in Other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.2.3), reflecting the loss of significant influence. The sale of pre-emptive subscription rights, in the amount of €10.2 million, is recognised in equity as an item not reclassifiable to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Through this operation, the Group received €106.2 million, including €10.2 million for the sale of pre-emptive subscription rights and €95.9 million for the sale of 3.619 million 74Software shares. As the sale of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares falls within the scope of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, they are no longer measured using the equity method. Accordingly, no profit from 74Software associated with the shares that were sold was recognised. The carrying amount of investments in associates consisted mainly of the value of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares until the date on which they were sold, with the remaining shares recognised under Non-consolidated securities. It changed as follows: (in millions of euros) Carrying amount 31 December 2022 183.5 Changes in scope 0.2 Dividend distribution -2.7 Profit for the period 6.7 Translation adjustments -2.3 Other comprehensive income -0.4 Other movements 0.8 31 December 2023 185.9 Changes in scope -190.3 Dividend distribution - Profit for the period -6.7 Translation adjustments 2.2 Other comprehensive income 0.0 Other movements 9.9 31 DECEMBER 2024 1.0 At 31 December 2023, Sopra Steria Group held a 31.96% stake in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). This stake did not give the Group a controlling interest in this subsidiary and did not allow it to involve itself in the running of the business or influence variable returns from this subsidiary. The Group thus exercised significant influence. Recognition and impairment of investments in associates Investments in associates are initially recognised at acquisition cost, and their value is then adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of their net assets. The remainder of this share appears under Equity-accounted investments on the asset side of the balance sheet. Its change over the financial year is recognised in profit or loss within Net profit from associates. Equity-accounted shares in a company constitute a single asset and must be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill on associates is included in the value of equity- accounted investments, the value of which is measured inclusive of goodwill. As such, goodwill on associates must not be tested for impairment separately. At each balance sheet date, where there is an indication of impairment of an investment in an associate, the parent company must carry out an impairment test consisting of comparing the carrying amount of the relevant equity- accounted investment with its recoverable amount. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is the higher of its value in use, calculated on the basis of future cash flows, and the fair value of the investment less costs of disposal. Where an associate’s shares are listed, fair value less costs of disposal is equal to market price less costs to sell: in the absence of any firm sale agreement, this is the price at which the shares are currently trading. Any impairment losses are charged to profit or loss as Other operating income and expenses. Where there is an improvement in the recoverable amount of an equity-accounted investment such that the impairment loss may be written back, the full amount of the impairment loss, including the portion relating to goodwill, must be written back."

The remainder corresponds to customer disputes, primarily in France, for €2.4 million. Provisions for tax risks other than income tax mainly concern risks relating to the R&D tax credit in France. Provisions for restructuring correspond to the cost of one-off restructuring measures, mainly in Germany (€0.9 million) and France (€1.7 million). Other provisions for contingencies mainly cover risks relating to clients and projects in the amount of €29.3 million (including €12.2 million in the United Kingdom, €7.9 million in France and €8.5 million in Germany), contractual risks (€6.8 million) and employee‐related risks (€4.2 million). Present obligations resulting from past events involving third parties are recognised in provisions only when it is probable that such obligations will give rise to an outflow of resources to third parties without consideration from said parties that is at least equivalent, and if the outflow of resources can be reliably measured. Since provisions are estimated based on future risks and expenses, such amounts include an element of uncertainty and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. The impact of discounting provisions is taken into account if significant. In the specific case of restructuring, an obligation is recognised as soon as the restructuring has been publicly announced and a detailed plan presented or the plan implementation has commenced. This cost mainly corresponds to severance payments, early retirement, costs related to notice periods not worked, training costs for departing employees and other costs relating to site closures. A provision is recognised for the rent and related costs to be paid, net of estimated subleasing income, in respect of any property if the asset is subleased or vacant and is not intended to be used in connection with main activities. Scrapped assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. 11.2. Contingent liabilities The contingent liabilities recognised arose as a result of the Sopra-Steria business combination in 2014. At 31 December 2024, they totalled €6.0 million after tax, corresponding to tax and contractual risks in India. To the extent that a liability is not probable or may not be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed by the Group among its commitments given. By exception, in connection with business combinations, the Group may recognise a contingent liability on the balance sheet if it results from a present obligation arising from past events and its fair value can be reliably estimated, even where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to extinguish the obligation."

Net debt, as presented in Note 12.3, is more representative of the Group’s financial position. Marketable securities and other short-term investments include money-market holdings, short-term deposits and advances under the liquidity agreement. The risk of a change in value on these investments is negligible. Of the €423.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding current bank overdrafts) at 31 December 2024, €323.2 million was held by the parent company and €100.1 million by the subsidiaries. Among the subsidiaries, entities in India contributed €36.0 million to net cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 (versus €25.5 million at 31 December 2023). Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank demand deposits, other highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities as part of Financial debt – Short-term portion. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, with the exception of foreign exchange impacts. UCITS classified by the AMF (France’s financial markets regulator) as belonging to the “money market fund” and “short-term money market fund” categories are, for practical purposes, presumed to automatically meet all four quoted eligibility criteria. Other cash UCITS cannot be presumed to be eligible for classification as “cash equivalents”: an analysis must be carried out to establish whether or not the four quoted criteria are met.

"304 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.3.2. Bank borrowings On 22 February 2022, the Group signed an agreement with its partner banks consisting of a €1,100 million non-amortising multi-currency credit facility tied to the achievement of environmental goals. Its ESG component does not constitute an embedded derivative. It is based on achieving a greenhouse gas emissions reduction aligned with a 1.5°C temperature increase scenario validated by SBTi for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and part of Scope 3. The target is to achieve a 68% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per employee by 2028 relative to a 2015 baseline. It is measured for each financial year and, if the target is met, will result in a 0.04% reduction per year in the applicable margin. In addition, the Company undertakes to pay an annual contribution equivalent to 0.04% of the margin applicable to sustainable projects, irrespective of whether it reaches the target. The Group’s achievement of its environmental performance targets in 2022 and 2023 made it possible to establish a dedicated fund of more than €0.2 million to fund innovative technology projects aimed at combating climate change. This agreement, with an initial term of five years, included two options to extend the expiry date by one year, exercised at the end of 2022 and 2023. The maturity of this credit facility is now set at 22 February 2029. At end-December 2024, this credit facility was undrawn. On 19 December 2023, the Group signed a contract with the same partner banks for a bank credit facility, drawn in the amount of €400 million, with a term of five years, comprised of a €280 million amortising tranche and a €120 million non- amortising tranche. This bank credit facility does not include an ESG component. Its balance at 31 December 2024 stood at €344.0 million. The Group also has several non-amortising bilateral bank facilities: some drawn to €67 million and others undrawn for €25 million, maturing in 2028. 12.3.3. Other financial debt In 2015, the Group arranged an unrated multi-currency NEU CP programme of short-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, in a maximum amount of €700 million. This programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was last updated in July 2024. The Group actively issued securities in 2024 and the average amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme grew, totalling €379.1 million in 2024, compared with €392.7 million in 2023. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme at 31 December 2024 was €99.0 million (€366.0 million at 31 December 2023), including floating-rate NEU CP amounting to €60.0 million and fixed-rate NEU CP amounting to €39.0 million. The NEU CPs are included in Other sundry financial debt. In December 2017, the Group arranged an NEU MTN programme of medium-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, with a maximum amount of €300 million. As was the case for the earlier NEU CP programme, the NEU MTN programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was updated in July 2024. The NEU MTN programme pays fixed or floating rates, with a spread at each issue date. Maturities range from one to five years. At 31 December 2024, the outstanding amount under the NEU MTN programme was €20.0 million, maturing in November 2025 (€10.0 million at 31 December 2023). The NEU MTNs are included in Other sundry financial debt. 12.4.

All financial instruments in this category are financial assets and liabilities classified as such upon first recognition. Financial debt is recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate. Hedging instruments may be put in place to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates by swapping part of the Group’s floating-rate debt for fixed-rate debt. The Group has entered into and continues to implement transactions designed to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk through the use of derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options as well as over-the- counter instruments with top-tier counterparties, as part of its overall risk management policy and due to the substantial scale of its production activities in India, Poland and Tunisia."
"305 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Derivatives are recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised directly in profit or loss for the period. Income tax receivables and payables are not financial instruments. The profit and loss impact of these financial instruments is as follows: (in millions of euros) 31/12/2024 Breakdown by category of instrument Profit or loss impact Fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through OCI Loans, receivables and other debt Liabilities at amortised cost Derivatives Total interest income 8.6 - 8.6 - - - Total interest expense -47.7 - - - -47.7 - Remeasurement 3.7 - - - - 3.7 NET GAINS OR LOSSES -35.4 - 8.6 - -47.7 3.7 The Group uses derivatives such as currency forwards, swaps and options to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. Any gains or losses resulting from fair value movements in derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognised directly in profit or loss as Other financial income and expenses. The fair value of currency forwards is calculated by reference to current rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the market value of similar instruments. For hedge accounting purposes, hedges are classified as either: ■fair value hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or a firm commitment (except foreign exchange risk); ■cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to fluctuations in cash flows attributable either to a specific risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable future transaction or foreign exchange risk on a firm commitment; ■hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedging instruments that satisfy hedge accounting criteria are recognised as follows: a. Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge are recognised in profit or loss (Other current operating income and expenses or Other financial income and expenses according to the type of hedged item). The ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised in profit or loss as part of Other financial income or Other financial expenses, either over the term of the instrument for financial hedges, or at the date of the hedged purchase or sale for hedges of commercial risk. Fair value gains and losses on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are also recognised in profit or loss. b. Cash flow hedges The gain or loss corresponding to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is taken to profit or loss, in Other financial income and expenses. Gains and losses recognised directly in equity are released to profit or loss under Other comprehensive income in the period during which the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. If the Group does not expect the realisation of the forecast transaction or commitment, the gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity will be released to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument matures, is sold, cancelled or exercised and is not replaced or renewed or if its designation as a hedging instrument is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity will be held in equity until realisation of the forecast transaction or firm commitment. c. Hedges of a net investment Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including hedges of monetary items recognised as part of a net investment, are recognised in Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss corresponding to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is taken to profit or loss. On the disposal of the foreign operation, cumulative gains and losses recognised directly in equity are released to profit or loss."
"306 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.5. Financial risk management 12.5.1. Liquidity risk The Group’s policy is to have credit facilities at its disposal that are much larger than its needs and to manage cash centrally at Group level where permitted by local law. Moreover, subsidiaries’ cash surpluses or borrowing requirements are managed centrally, being invested or met by the Sopra Steria Group parent company, which carries the bulk of the Group’s borrowings and bank credit facilities. As part of its efforts to diversify its borrowings, the Group has a €300 million NEU MTN programme to supplement its €700 million NEU CP programme launched in 2015. In 2024, the amounts received from the sale of Sopra Banking Software and 74Software (€416.7 million) were used to fund the share buyback programme (€106.9 million), gradually reduce the amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme and make investments in the form of certificates of deposit maturing in less than three months with members of the banking syndicate. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme was €99.0 million at 31 December 2024 (€366.0 million in December 2023). Bilateral credit facilities were in place for a total of €92.0 million, with maturities in 2028. At 31 December 2024, they were drawn down in the amount of €67.0 million. At 31 December 2024, the Group had credit facilities totalling €1,978 million, 34% of which was drawn down. Undrawn available credit lines amounted to €1,302 million (€1,100 million in RCFs and €25 million in bilateral credit facilities), in addition to undrawn overdraft facilities for €177 million. Aside from the syndicated loan, bilateral credit facilities and bonds, the Group’s financing essentially consists of issues under NEU CP (short-term commercial paper) and NEU MTN programmes. These financing sources break down as shown below: (in millions of euros) Amount authorised at 31/12/2024 Drawdown at 31/12/ 2024 Drawdown Repayment terms Interest rate at 31/ 12/2024 €m £m €m £m Bond 250.0 - 250.0 - 100% At maturity €130m 07/2026 €120m 07/2027 1.87% Syndicated loan ■Multi-currency revolving credit facility 1,100.0 - - 0% 02/2029 * ■Bank borrowings 344.0 344.0 - 100% Amortising tranche of €224m & tranche due at maturity of €120m, maturing 12/ 2028 4.09% Bilateral credit facilities 92.0 67.0 73% 2026 to 2028 4.62% Other 15.6 15.6 - 100% 2025 to 2026 3.01% Overdraft 176.5 - 0.0 N/A Total credit facilities authorised per currency 1,978.1 - 676.6 - TOTAL CREDIT FACILITIES AUTHORISED (€ EQUIVALENT) 1,978.1 676.6 34% 3.30% Other types of financing used NEU CP & NEU MTN 119.0 2025 4.02% Other 10.0 2025 Total financing per currency 805.5 - TOTAL FINANCING (€ EQUIVALENT) 805.5 3.36% * The two one‐year extension options were exercised and unanimously approved by lenders in February 2023 and December 2023. Interest rates payable on the syndicated loan equal the interbank rate of the currency concerned at the time of drawdown (minimum 0%), plus a margin set for a period of six months based on the leverage ratio. The €250 million bond issued on 5 July 2019 has an effective interest rate of 1.749% for the €130 million tranche and 2% for the €120 million tranche. The bond issue is subject to terms and conditions, which include financial covenants. Two financial ratios are calculated every six months using the consolidated financial statements on a 12-month rolling basis: ■the first – known as the leverage ratio – is equal to net financial debt divided by pro forma EBITDA; ■the second – known as the interest coverage ratio – is equal to pro forma EBITDA divided by the cost of net financial debt. The first financial ratio must not exceed 3.0 at any reporting date. The second ratio must not fall below 5.0. Net financial debt is defined on a consolidated basis as all loans and related borrowings (excluding intercompany liabilities and lease liabilities), less available cash and cash equivalents. Pro forma EBITDA is Consolidated operating profit on business activity adding back depreciation, amortisation and provisions included in Operating profit on business activity before the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (see Note 1.6.1). It is calculated on a 12-month rolling basis and is therefore restated so as to be presented in the financial statements at constant scope over 12 months."
"307 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 31 December 2024, the net financial debt/pro forma EBITDA ratio covenant was met, with the ratio coming in at 0.61 compared with a covenant of 3.0.

At 31 December 2024, the pro forma EBITDA to cost of net financial debt covenant – requiring a ratio of at least 5.0 – was met, with the ratio coming in at 17.60. It is calculated as follows: (in millions of euros) 31/12/2024 31/12/2023 Pro forma EBITDA 623.1 631.6 Cost of net financial debt 35.4 19.5 PRO FORMA EBITDA / COST OF NET FINANCIAL DEBT RATIO 17.60 32.31 The two syndicated loan facilities are subject to conditions including a single financial covenant: the leverage ratio, calculated in the same way as for the bond issue, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements, on a 12-month rolling basis, but only annually. At 31 December 2024, this covenant was met. In addition to satisfying the financial ratio prerequisites described above, the Group’s three main financing agreements also contain: ■certain performance requirements that are entirely customary for this type of financing; ■clauses relating to events of default such as payment default, inaccurate tax returns, cross-default, bankruptcy, or the occurrence of an event having a material adverse effect; ■clauses stipulating early repayment in full in the event that there is a change in control of the Company. The bank loan agreement also stipulates a number of circumstances in which the loan must be repaid in advance, in full or in part as applicable, or renegotiated with the banks: ■early repayment if all or a substantial number of the Company’s assets are sold; ■repayment using proceeds from asset disposals (beyond a specified threshold); ■renegotiation of the financing terms and conditions in the event of financial market disruption, i.e.Market disruption clause. This clause is only applicable if a minimum number of banks are unable to obtain refinancing on the capital market at the date on which the financing is requested, given interest rate fluctuations. The purpose of this clause is to find a replacement rate.

At 31 December 2024, the investments were held mainly by the parent company, Sopra Steria Group. At constant exchange rates relative to 31 December 2024, and taking into account short-term investments held at that date, a 50-basis-point decrease in floating rates would reduce annual financial income by €1.7 million. 12.5.2. Bank counterparty risk All foreign currency and interest rate hedges are put in place with leading banks belonging to the Group’s banking syndicate, with which market transaction agreements have been signed. The majority of the Group’s financial investments relate to the Sopra Steria Group parent company and the subsidiaries in India. Financial investments are carried out either via short- term bank deposits with banks mainly belonging to the banking syndicate, or via money-market instruments managed by leading financial institutions, which are themselves subsidiaries of banks mainly belonging to the syndicate. These investments are subject to approval by the Group, and comply with internally defined principles of prudence. Thanks to these various measures, the Group considers that it has implemented a system that significantly reduces its bank counterparty risk in the current economic context. However, the Group remains subject to a residual risk which may affect its performance under certain conditions. 12.5.3. Interest rate risk The Group’s aim is to protect itself against interest rate fluctuations by hedging part of its floating-rate debt and investing its cash over periods of less than three months. The derivatives used to hedge the debt are interest rate swap contracts or options, which may or may not be eligible for hedge accounting. The eligible counterparties for interest rate hedging and investments are leading financial institutions which belong to the Sopra Steria banking syndicate. These financial instruments are managed by the Group’s Finance Department. All of the Group’s interest rate hedges have been put in place through the parent company (Sopra Steria Group)."

"299 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Leases Leases are recognised in the balance sheet at the lease commencement date, which corresponds to the date at which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee, and results in the recognition of a balance sheet asset within Right-of-use assets and a liability within Lease liabilities. The value of lease liabilities corresponds to the present value of minimum future payments, discounted over the lease term using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or otherwise the incremental borrowing rate of the entity leasing the asset. The lease term chiefly reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease. The Group may adjust it, where it considers this to be reasonable, to reflect the period of a renewal or an extension option, which could be exercised, or an early termination option, which could be invoked where the corresponding penalties (contractual penalties and economic costs of doing so) would be more than negligible. At the lease commencement date, the value of the right-of- use asset recognised in the balance sheet corresponds to the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease, prepaid lease payments, incentives received from the lessor at that date, or costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset. Minimum future payments include fixed lease payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option, and termination or non-renewal penalties if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise or not exercise these options. Some of these values may change over the term of the lease, in which case the values of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are revised upward or downward. They do not include any service components that may be included in the lease, which continue to be recognised as expenses. In the balance sheet, Lease liabilities are split out into non- current and current portions. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset if the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee, or if the lessee is reasonably certain of exercising a purchase option. In the income statement, these amortisation expenses are included within Depreciation, amortisation, provisions and impairment under Operating profit on business activity. The Net interest expense on lease liabilities is split out from the line item Other financial income and expenses. Finally, as an exception, short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (individual value less than 5,000 USD) are directly recognised as expenses and are therefore not restated in the balance sheet. Variable lease payments are also recognised as expenses according to the use or revenue generated by the use of the underlying asset. 9.2. Breakdown of lease liabilities by maturity The lease amortisation schedule is as follows: (in millions of euros) Value of contractual flows Current Non-current Breakdown of non-current portion 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years More than 5 years LEASE LIABILITIES 475.4 115.2 360.2 94.1 71.1 49.1 40.7 105.1 NOTE 10 EQUITY‐ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 10.1.

"300 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.2. Carrying amount of investments in associates This note supplements the description of transactions set out in Note 2.2. The sale of most of the activities of Sopra Banking Software involved the transfer by the Group to Sopra GMT of 3.619 million of the 6.914 million shares it held in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). The sale was completed on 19 July 2024. It brought the Group’s stake in 74Software to around 15%. As part of the same transaction, the Group sold to Sopra GMT all its pre-emptive subscription rights to 74Software shares. As the latter funded the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software, in particular through a capital increase, the Group’s stake was diluted and only amounted to 11.1% following this transaction. The Group no longer exerts significant influence over 74Software, and the 74Software shares were reclassified under Non‐consolidated securities as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.A €11.1 million profit from sale of business, recognised in Other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.2.3), reflecting the loss of significant influence. The sale of pre-emptive subscription rights, in the amount of €10.2 million, is recognised in equity as an item not reclassifiable to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Through this operation, the Group received €106.2 million, including €10.2 million for the sale of pre-emptive subscription rights and €95.9 million for the sale of 3.619 million 74Software shares. As the sale of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares falls within the scope of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, they are no longer measured using the equity method. Accordingly, no profit from 74Software associated with the shares that were sold was recognised. The carrying amount of investments in associates consisted mainly of the value of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares until the date on which they were sold, with the remaining shares recognised under Non-consolidated securities. It changed as follows: (in millions of euros) Carrying amount 31 December 2022 183.5 Changes in scope 0.2 Dividend distribution -2.7 Profit for the period 6.7 Translation adjustments -2.3 Other comprehensive income -0.4 Other movements 0.8 31 December 2023 185.9 Changes in scope -190.3 Dividend distribution - Profit for the period -6.7 Translation adjustments 2.2 Other comprehensive income 0.0 Other movements 9.9 31 DECEMBER 2024 1.0 At 31 December 2023, Sopra Steria Group held a 31.96% stake in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). This stake did not give the Group a controlling interest in this subsidiary and did not allow it to involve itself in the running of the business or influence variable returns from this subsidiary. The Group thus exercised significant influence. Recognition and impairment of investments in associates Investments in associates are initially recognised at acquisition cost, and their value is then adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of their net assets. The remainder of this share appears under Equity-accounted investments on the asset side of the balance sheet. Its change over the financial year is recognised in profit or loss within Net profit from associates. Equity-accounted shares in a company constitute a single asset and must be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill on associates is included in the value of equity- accounted investments, the value of which is measured inclusive of goodwill. As such, goodwill on associates must not be tested for impairment separately. At each balance sheet date, where there is an indication of impairment of an investment in an associate, the parent company must carry out an impairment test consisting of comparing the carrying amount of the relevant equity- accounted investment with its recoverable amount. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is the higher of its value in use, calculated on the basis of future cash flows, and the fair value of the investment less costs of disposal. Where an associate’s shares are listed, fair value less costs of disposal is equal to market price less costs to sell: in the absence of any firm sale agreement, this is the price at which the shares are currently trading. Any impairment losses are charged to profit or loss as Other operating income and expenses.

The remainder corresponds to customer disputes, primarily in France, for €2.4 million. Provisions for tax risks other than income tax mainly concern risks relating to the R&D tax credit in France. Provisions for restructuring correspond to the cost of one-off restructuring measures, mainly in Germany (€0.9 million) and France (€1.7 million). Other provisions for contingencies mainly cover risks relating to clients and projects in the amount of €29.3 million (including €12.2 million in the United Kingdom, €7.9 million in France and €8.5 million in Germany), contractual risks (€6.8 million) and employee‐related risks (€4.2 million). Present obligations resulting from past events involving third parties are recognised in provisions only when it is probable that such obligations will give rise to an outflow of resources to third parties without consideration from said parties that is at least equivalent, and if the outflow of resources can be reliably measured. Since provisions are estimated based on future risks and expenses, such amounts include an element of uncertainty and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. The impact of discounting provisions is taken into account if significant. In the specific case of restructuring, an obligation is recognised as soon as the restructuring has been publicly announced and a detailed plan presented or the plan implementation has commenced. This cost mainly corresponds to severance payments, early retirement, costs related to notice periods not worked, training costs for departing employees and other costs relating to site closures. A provision is recognised for the rent and related costs to be paid, net of estimated subleasing income, in respect of any property if the asset is subleased or vacant and is not intended to be used in connection with main activities. Scrapped assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. 11.2. Contingent liabilities The contingent liabilities recognised arose as a result of the Sopra-Steria business combination in 2014. At 31 December 2024, they totalled €6.0 million after tax, corresponding to tax and contractual risks in India. To the extent that a liability is not probable or may not be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed by the Group among its commitments given. By exception, in connection with business combinations, the Group may recognise a contingent liability on the balance sheet if it results from a present obligation arising from past events and its fair value can be reliably estimated, even where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to extinguish the obligation."

"304 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.3.2. Bank borrowings On 22 February 2022, the Group signed an agreement with its partner banks consisting of a €1,100 million non-amortising multi-currency credit facility tied to the achievement of environmental goals. Its ESG component does not constitute an embedded derivative. It is based on achieving a greenhouse gas emissions reduction aligned with a 1.5°C temperature increase scenario validated by SBTi for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and part of Scope 3. The target is to achieve a 68% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per employee by 2028 relative to a 2015 baseline. It is measured for each financial year and, if the target is met, will result in a 0.04% reduction per year in the applicable margin. In addition, the Company undertakes to pay an annual contribution equivalent to 0.04% of the margin applicable to sustainable projects, irrespective of whether it reaches the target. The Group’s achievement of its environmental performance targets in 2022 and 2023 made it possible to establish a dedicated fund of more than €0.2 million to fund innovative technology projects aimed at combating climate change. This agreement, with an initial term of five years, included two options to extend the expiry date by one year, exercised at the end of 2022 and 2023. The maturity of this credit facility is now set at 22 February 2029. At end-December 2024, this credit facility was undrawn. On 19 December 2023, the Group signed a contract with the same partner banks for a bank credit facility, drawn in the amount of €400 million, with a term of five years, comprised of a €280 million amortising tranche and a €120 million non- amortising tranche. This bank credit facility does not include an ESG component. Its balance at 31 December 2024 stood at €344.0 million. The Group also has several non-amortising bilateral bank facilities: some drawn to €67 million and others undrawn for €25 million, maturing in 2028. 12.3.3. Other financial debt In 2015, the Group arranged an unrated multi-currency NEU CP programme of short-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, in a maximum amount of €700 million. This programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was last updated in July 2024. The Group actively issued securities in 2024 and the average amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme grew, totalling €379.1 million in 2024, compared with €392.7 million in 2023. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme at 31 December 2024 was €99.0 million (€366.0 million at 31 December 2023), including floating-rate NEU CP amounting to €60.0 million and fixed-rate NEU CP amounting to €39.0 million. The NEU CPs are included in Other sundry financial debt. In December 2017, the Group arranged an NEU MTN programme of medium-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, with a maximum amount of €300 million. As was the case for the earlier NEU CP programme, the NEU MTN programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was updated in July 2024. The NEU MTN programme pays fixed or floating rates, with a spread at each issue date. Maturities range from one to five years. At 31 December 2024, the outstanding amount under the NEU MTN programme was €20.0 million, maturing in November 2025 (€10.0 million at 31 December 2023). The NEU MTNs are included in Other sundry financial debt. 12.4.

All financial instruments in this category are financial assets and liabilities classified as such upon first recognition. Financial debt is recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate. Hedging instruments may be put in place to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates by swapping part of the Group’s floating-rate debt for fixed-rate debt. The Group has entered into and continues to implement transactions designed to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk through the use of derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options as well as over-the- counter instruments with top-tier counterparties, as part of its overall risk management policy and due to the substantial scale of its production activities in India, Poland and Tunisia."
"305 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Derivatives are recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised directly in profit or loss for the period. Income tax receivables and payables are not financial instruments. The profit and loss impact of these financial instruments is as follows: (in millions of euros) 31/12/2024 Breakdown by category of instrument Profit or loss impact Fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through OCI Loans, receivables and other debt Liabilities at amortised cost Derivatives Total interest income 8.6 - 8.6 - - - Total interest expense -47.7 - - - -47.7 - Remeasurement 3.7 - - - - 3.7 NET GAINS OR LOSSES -35.4 - 8.6 - -47.7 3.7 The Group uses derivatives such as currency forwards, swaps and options to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. Any gains or losses resulting from fair value movements in derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognised directly in profit or loss as Other financial income and expenses. The fair value of currency forwards is calculated by reference to current rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the market value of similar instruments. For hedge accounting purposes, hedges are classified as either: ■fair value hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or a firm commitment (except foreign exchange risk); ■cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to fluctuations in cash flows attributable either to a specific risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable future transaction or foreign exchange risk on a firm commitment; ■hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedging instruments that satisfy hedge accounting criteria are recognised as follows: a. Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge are recognised in profit or loss (Other current operating income and expenses or Other financial income and expenses according to the type of hedged item). The ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised in profit or loss as part of Other financial income or Other financial expenses, either over the term of the instrument for financial hedges, or at the date of the hedged purchase or sale for hedges of commercial risk. Fair value gains and losses on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are also recognised in profit or loss. b. Cash flow hedges The gain or loss corresponding to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is taken to profit or loss, in Other financial income and expenses. Gains and losses recognised directly in equity are released to profit or loss under Other comprehensive income in the period during which the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. If the Group does not expect the realisation of the forecast transaction or commitment, the gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity will be released to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument matures, is sold, cancelled or exercised and is not replaced or renewed or if its designation as a hedging instrument is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity will be held in equity until realisation of the forecast transaction or firm commitment. c. Hedges of a net investment Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including hedges of monetary items recognised as part of a net investment, are recognised in Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss corresponding to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is taken to profit or loss. On the disposal of the foreign operation, cumulative gains and losses recognised directly in equity are released to profit or loss."
"306 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.5. Financial risk management 12.5.1. Liquidity risk The Group’s policy is to have credit facilities at its disposal that are much larger than its needs and to manage cash centrally at Group level where permitted by local law. Moreover, subsidiaries’ cash surpluses or borrowing requirements are managed centrally, being invested or met by the Sopra Steria Group parent company, which carries the bulk of the Group’s borrowings and bank credit facilities. As part of its efforts to diversify its borrowings, the Group has a €300 million NEU MTN programme to supplement its €700 million NEU CP programme launched in 2015. In 2024, the amounts received from the sale of Sopra Banking Software and 74Software (€416.7 million) were used to fund the share buyback programme (€106.9 million), gradually reduce the amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme and make investments in the form of certificates of deposit maturing in less than three months with members of the banking syndicate. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme was €99.0 million at 31 December 2024 (€366.0 million in December 2023). Bilateral credit facilities were in place for a total of €92.0 million, with maturities in 2028. At 31 December 2024, they were drawn down in the amount of €67.0 million. At 31 December 2024, the Group had credit facilities totalling €1,978 million, 34% of which was drawn down. Undrawn available credit lines amounted to €1,302 million (€1,100 million in RCFs and €25 million in bilateral credit facilities), in addition to undrawn overdraft facilities for €177 million. Aside from the syndicated loan, bilateral credit facilities and bonds, the Group’s financing essentially consists of issues under NEU CP (short-term commercial paper) and NEU MTN programmes. These financing sources break down as shown below: (in millions of euros) Amount authorised at 31/12/2024 Drawdown at 31/12/ 2024 Drawdown Repayment terms Interest rate at 31/ 12/2024 €m £m €m £m Bond 250.0 - 250.0 - 100% At maturity €130m 07/2026 €120m 07/2027 1.87% Syndicated loan ■Multi-currency revolving credit facility 1,100.0 - - 0% 02/2029 * ■Bank borrowings 344.0 344.0 - 100% Amortising tranche of €224m & tranche due at maturity of €120m, maturing 12/ 2028 4.09% Bilateral credit facilities 92.0 67.0 73% 2026 to 2028 4.62% Other 15.6 15.6 - 100% 2025 to 2026 3.01% Overdraft 176.5 - 0.0 N/A Total credit facilities authorised per currency 1,978.1 - 676.6 - TOTAL CREDIT FACILITIES AUTHORISED (€ EQUIVALENT) 1,978.1 676.6 34% 3.30% Other types of financing used NEU CP & NEU MTN 119.0 2025 4.02% Other 10.0 2025 Total financing per currency 805.5 - TOTAL FINANCING (€ EQUIVALENT) 805.5 3.36% * The two one‐year extension options were exercised and unanimously approved by lenders in February 2023 and December 2023. Interest rates payable on the syndicated loan equal the interbank rate of the currency concerned at the time of drawdown (minimum 0%), plus a margin set for a period of six months based on the leverage ratio. The €250 million bond issued on 5 July 2019 has an effective interest rate of 1.749% for the €130 million tranche and 2% for the €120 million tranche. The bond issue is subject to terms and conditions, which include financial covenants. Two financial ratios are calculated every six months using the consolidated financial statements on a 12-month rolling basis: ■the first – known as the leverage ratio – is equal to net financial debt divided by pro forma EBITDA; ■the second – known as the interest coverage ratio – is equal to pro forma EBITDA divided by the cost of net financial debt. The first financial ratio must not exceed 3.0 at any reporting date. The second ratio must not fall below 5.0. Net financial debt is defined on a consolidated basis as all loans and related borrowings (excluding intercompany liabilities and lease liabilities), less available cash and cash equivalents. Pro forma EBITDA is Consolidated operating profit on business activity adding back depreciation, amortisation and provisions included in Operating profit on business activity before the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (see Note 1.6.1). It is calculated on a 12-month rolling basis and is therefore restated so as to be presented in the financial statements at constant scope over 12 months."
"307 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements At 31 December 2024, the net financial debt/pro forma EBITDA ratio covenant was met, with the ratio coming in at 0.61 compared with a covenant of 3.0.

At 31 December 2024, the pro forma EBITDA to cost of net financial debt covenant – requiring a ratio of at least 5.0 – was met, with the ratio coming in at 17.60. It is calculated as follows: (in millions of euros) 31/12/2024 31/12/2023 Pro forma EBITDA 623.1 631.6 Cost of net financial debt 35.4 19.5 PRO FORMA EBITDA / COST OF NET FINANCIAL DEBT RATIO 17.60 32.31 The two syndicated loan facilities are subject to conditions including a single financial covenant: the leverage ratio, calculated in the same way as for the bond issue, on the basis of the consolidated financial statements, on a 12-month rolling basis, but only annually. At 31 December 2024, this covenant was met. In addition to satisfying the financial ratio prerequisites described above, the Group’s three main financing agreements also contain: ■certain performance requirements that are entirely customary for this type of financing; ■clauses relating to events of default such as payment default, inaccurate tax returns, cross-default, bankruptcy, or the occurrence of an event having a material adverse effect; ■clauses stipulating early repayment in full in the event that there is a change in control of the Company. The bank loan agreement also stipulates a number of circumstances in which the loan must be repaid in advance, in full or in part as applicable, or renegotiated with the banks: ■early repayment if all or a substantial number of the Company’s assets are sold; ■repayment using proceeds from asset disposals (beyond a specified threshold); ■renegotiation of the financing terms and conditions in the event of financial market disruption, i.e.Market disruption clause. This clause is only applicable if a minimum number of banks are unable to obtain refinancing on the capital market at the date on which the financing is requested, given interest rate fluctuations. The purpose of this clause is to find a replacement rate.

At 31 December 2024, the investments were held mainly by the parent company, Sopra Steria Group. At constant exchange rates relative to 31 December 2024, and taking into account short-term investments held at that date, a 50-basis-point decrease in floating rates would reduce annual financial income by €1.7 million. 12.5.2. Bank counterparty risk All foreign currency and interest rate hedges are put in place with leading banks belonging to the Group’s banking syndicate, with which market transaction agreements have been signed. The majority of the Group’s financial investments relate to the Sopra Steria Group parent company and the subsidiaries in India. Financial investments are carried out either via short- term bank deposits with banks mainly belonging to the banking syndicate, or via money-market instruments managed by leading financial institutions, which are themselves subsidiaries of banks mainly belonging to the syndicate. These investments are subject to approval by the Group, and comply with internally defined principles of prudence. Thanks to these various measures, the Group considers that it has implemented a system that significantly reduces its bank counterparty risk in the current economic context. However, the Group remains subject to a residual risk which may affect its performance under certain conditions. 12.5.3. Interest rate risk The Group’s aim is to protect itself against interest rate fluctuations by hedging part of its floating-rate debt and investing its cash over periods of less than three months. The derivatives used to hedge the debt are interest rate swap contracts or options, which may or may not be eligible for hedge accounting. The eligible counterparties for interest rate hedging and investments are leading financial institutions which belong to the Sopra Steria banking syndicate. These financial instruments are managed by the Group’s Finance Department. All of the Group’s interest rate hedges have been put in place through the parent company (Sopra Steria Group)."
"98 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Organisation and operation of governance In particular, the aims of this questionnaire were to: ■evaluate to what extent the composition of the Board of Directors actually represents all shareholders and allows it to fulfil its role and responsibilities efficiently. The questionnaire also focused on the Directors’ contributions to meetings, any conflicts of interest, their complementarity, independence and involvement, as well as their understanding of the Company’s business activities, and the manner in which they update and refresh their skills and knowledge; ■ascertain the quality of the information made available to members of the Board of Directors and how discussions are led by the Chairman; ■check their level of satisfaction with the responses provided to their questions and the handling of their requests; ■identify potential improvements to work procedures, from the annual work schedule to the minutes of meetings; ■evaluate the preparation of discussions by the Board’s specialised committees and the contribution of their work to the quality of exchanges at Board meetings. After the questionnaire was approved by the Board of Directors, an overview of its findings was reviewed and discussed by the Nomination, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee. The Committee also discussed an overview of its own self-assessment and the concurrent self- assessments undertaken by the Compensation Committee and the Audit Committee. It reported on its work to the Board of Directors at the Board meeting of 25 January 2024. The Audit Committee has conducted its own self-assessment for a number of years using a questionnaire that covers its composition and its working procedures, the way in which its work is organised and its ability to fulfil its responsibilities. The Committee compares its procedures with the best practices established by similar bodies in other companies. Lastly, it familiarises itself with any changes in the regulatory environment. It takes into account the conclusions of this work to improve its own working procedures. Self-assessment by the Board of Directors and its committees has identified opportunities for improvement, notably relating to its composition, and consideration of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) by the Board of Directors and its committees. These were presented to the Board of Directors, which approved them. The process concluded with a discussion on 26 January 2023. Specific measures were taken to address the areas identified for improvement. The industry- specific expertise of the Board of Directors was strengthened by the arrival of Yves de Talhouët and Pascal Daloz. In 2023, CSR considerations led the Board of Directors to discuss multi- year strategic priorities in terms of social and environmental responsibility. In 2024, the Board of Directors and its standing committees played a significant role in monitoring the implementation of the CSRD by the company."
"99 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of company officers 2. Compensation of company officers 2.1. General principles While paying particular attention to the stability of the principles used to determine and structure compensation for executive company officers, the Board of Directors re- examines their compensation packages on an annual basis to verify their fit with the Group’s requirements. In particular, the Board checks that compensation policy: ■continues to be in keeping with the Company’s best interests; ■contributes to the Company’s long-term success, taking into account its social and environmental priorities; ■is in keeping with the Company’s business strategy. The Board also checks that compensation policy complies with the recommendations laid down in the AFEP-MEDEF Code. To this end, it is supported by the Compensation Committee, which helps it prepare its decisions in this area. The Board of Directors considers that applying the compensation recommendations laid down in the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance protects the Company’s interests and encourages executives’ contribution to business strategy and the Company’s long-term success. The Compensation Committee usually meets three to five times between October and February to help the Board prepare its decisions. The Board of Directors generally discusses the Company’s strategy during the same period, taking into account its social and environmental priorities. For the past several years, the Group has been pursuing an independent, sustainable, value- creating plan that combines growth and profitability. Priorities are adjusted each financial year based on the current state assessment undertaken at the end of the previous year. The Committee reviews the current compensation policy applicable to company officers. It then reviews estimates of the extent to which targets have been achieved by the Chief Executive Officer. These forecasts are refined in the course of the Committee’s various meetings. At the beginning of the year, the Compensation Committee notes the extent to which quantifiable targets set for the previous financial year have been achieved. It assesses the extent to which qualitative targets have been met. To this end, it meets with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and familiarises itself with any information that might be used in this assessment. The Committee also takes into consideration the Group’s compensation policy and decisions on fixed and variable compensation of the members of the Group Executive Committee. It takes into account comparisons with other companies made available to it. However, sector consolidation has significantly reduced the number of companies allowing for a direct and relevant comparison. The Committee also considers ways in which employees may be given a stake in the Company’s financial performance. It assesses the suitability of share ownership plans for all employees and long-term incentive plans for managers of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Board of Directors considers that employee and executive share ownership makes a lasting contribution to the Company’s priority focus on independence and value creation. It provides extra motivation and ensures that employees’ and executives’ interests are fully aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders. The Board of Directors has not, to date, specified the number of shares that must be held and registered in the name of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, who co-founded the Company. Shares held directly or indirectly through Sopra GMT by the Chairman in a personal capacity or by the Chairman’s family group make up more than 10% of the Company’s share capital. The Board of Directors has laid down two obligations for the Chief Executive Officer: ■to retain at least 50% of the performance shares actually awarded to him during his term of office; ■to achieve the target, by 2026, of him holding shares in the Company in an amount equivalent to 50% of his annual fixed compensation. When the Board of Directors reviews the budget for the current financial year, the Company’s quantitative targets are a known quantity. The Compensation Committee takes them into account when determining the Chief Executive Officer’s quantitative targets for the financial year. It holds a further meeting with the Chairman of the Board of Directors to discuss potential qualitative targets. The Compensation Committee then presents its recommendations to the Board of Directors, which discusses them without the interested parties in attendance. These recommendations relate to the variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer for the previous financial year, the fixed compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, and the fixed and variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer for the current financial year. The Committee also presents its observations on how compensation is apportioned among the Directors and any proposed adjustments. The total amount of the compensation provided for in Article L. 225-45 of the French Commercial Code subject to approval by the shareholders is agreed when the Board of Directors meets to prepare for the General Meeting of Shareholders. As regards variable compensation, the Compensation Committee proposes the quantifiable criteria to be taken into account together with any qualitative criteria, as the case may be. It makes certain that the targets adopted are mainly quantifiable and that criteria are precisely defined. As regards quantifiable criteria, it generally determines: ■a threshold below which variable compensation is not paid; ■a target level at which 100% of compensation linked to the criterion in question becomes payable; and ■where applicable, an upper limit if there is the possibility that a target may be exceeded. Performance is assessed by comparing actual performance with the target broken down into thresholds and target levels, as the case may be. This assessment is carried out without any offsetting between targets. Where, by exception, compensation may exceed the target level, the extent to which it may do so is capped. In principle, the targets set do not allow variable compensation to exceed 60% of annual fixed compensation. However, in the event of a particularly remarkable performance with regard to quantifiable targets, the Board of Directors may, after consulting the Compensation Committee, authorise compensation to take into account targets having been exceeded, subject to the cap on annual variable compensation set at 100% of annual fixed compensation. Effective payment of the Chief Executive Officer’s variable compensation will, in any event, be subject to shareholder approval at an Ordinary General Meeting. Conversely, the Board of Directors may consider that the Group’s performance does not allow for payment of variable compensation in respect of the financial year. In such a case, it does not take into account the extent to which qualitative targets have been met. It proposes to the shareholders that no variable compensation be paid in respect of that financial year."
"100 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of company officers Lastly, in the event of exceptional circumstances (such as an exogenous shock) leading to the suspension of the normal system of variable compensation for employees and Group Executive Committee members, the Compensation Committee would review the situation of the Chief Executive Officer. It could recommend to the Board of Directors that it ask the shareholders at the General Meeting to approve the addition of a bonus to the Chief Executive Officer’s variable compensation if that would serve the Company’s interests, subject to an upper limit of 60% of his annual fixed compensation. Long-term incentive plans are based on awarding rights to shares. They are subject to the condition of being with the Company over a period of time and performance conditions. The targets are set in the same way as for variable compensation. Independently of the compensation policy, the Company covers or reimburses company officers’ travel expenses (transportation and accommodation). The procedure for determining compensation policy applicable to executive company officers and the timing of that procedure are intended to ensure that all useful information is taken into account when recommendations are drawn up and when the Board of Directors makes its final decision. This ensures that such decisions are consistent among themselves and aligned with the Company’s strategy. The Nomination, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee have one member in common. The compensation policy applies to newly appointed company officers. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as to enable the replacement or appointment of a new executive company officer, the Board of Directors may waive application of the compensation policy. Such waivers must be temporary, aligned with the Company’s interests and necessary to secure the Company’s long-term success or viability. Furthermore, this option may only be adopted where there is consensus among the members of the Board of Directors as to the decision to be taken (i.e. no votes against). This may result in the awarding of items of compensation currently defined in the compensation policy as not applicable (severance pay, non-compete payment, supplementary pension plan). These items would be put to the vote at the following General Meeting. 2.2. Executive company officers The compensation policy for executive company officers was subject to recommendations made by the Compensation Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 26 February 2025. The compensation policy and any variable and exceptional items of compensation must be approved at the General Meeting prior to their payment. 2.2.1. COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors, subject to approval at the General Meeting ITEMS OF COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Items of compensation Comments Annual fixed compensation Set by the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation by the Compensation Committee Annual variable compensation Not applicable Deferred variable compensation Not applicable Multi-year variable compensation Not applicable Deferment periods; option of asking for variable compensation to be returned Not applicable Exceptional compensation Possible, by decision of the Board of Directors, but contingent upon very specific circumstances with substantial consequences on the role and activity of the Chairman of the Board of Directors Payment subject to shareholder approval of all items of compensation at an Ordinary General Meeting and in all circumstances capped at 100% of annual fixed compensation Stock options, performance shares and any other long-term items of compensation Not applicable Compensation referred to in Article L. 22-10-14 of the French Commercial Code Application of Directors’ compensation policy Any other benefits Company car Severance pay/benefit payable upon change of duties Not applicable Non-compete payment Not applicable Supplementary pension plan Not applicable"
"101 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of company officers Decisions made in 2025 The Board of Directors decided, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, not to make any changes to the compensation policy applicable to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, but it did increase his annual fixed compensation to €600,000 from 1 July 2025. This decision, made to coincide with the review of the Chief Executive Officer’s compensation, takes into account the fact that the amount of his compensation had not been revised since 2011 and the importance of the prerogative powers of the Chairman. 2.2.2. COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Compensation policy for the Chief Executive Officer, subject to approval at the General Meeting These principles shall also be applicable for any Deputy Chief Executive Officers. ITEMS OF COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Items of compensation Comments Annual fixed compensation Set by the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation by the Compensation Committee (taking into account responsibilities held, experience and internal and external benchmarking) Annual variable compensation Amount: ■60% of annual fixed compensation if targets are met; ■capped at 100% of annual fixed compensation; ■Criteria: ●minimum of 70% based on one or more quantifiable targets, ●maximum of 30% based on one or more precisely defined qualitative targets consistent with the Group’s strategy and organisation, its corporate social responsibility (CSR) policy and/or the assessment of the company officer’s performance; ■payment subject to shareholder approval of all items of compensation at an Ordinary General Meeting.

"102 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of company officers Decisions made in 2025 The Board of Directors decided, on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, to introduce a principle into the compensation policy reducing the rights to performance shares should the term of office expire before the end of the plan, and to increase the Chief Executive Officer’s annual fixed compensation to €600,000 from 1 July 2025. This decision follows a prior commitment to review made following a change in Group scope due to the success of significant external growth operations. It takes into account external and internal benchmarking, as well as the experience gained by Cyril Malargé since he assumed his duties. With regard to annual variable compensation: ■should the targets be met, the amount of the budget will be reviewed in 2026; ■as no changes were made to the compensation policy in this respect, annual variable compensation will again be structured as follows: Criteria Type % of AVC* % of AFC* One or more targets Quantifiable 70% min. 42% min. One or more targets Qualitative 30% max. 18% max. TOTAL 100% 60% *AVC: annual variable compensation; AFC: annual fixed compensation. Quantifiable targets may, in particular, relate to the operating margin on business activity, organic revenue growth or free cash flow. The portion linked exclusively to the achievement of qualitative targets reflects a desire to take into account medium-term targets (relating to the Group’s governance and organisation and its social priorities) and long-term targets (environmental priorities). With regard to CSR, quantifiable indicators and associated targets help the Group check every year that it remains on course to achieve its goals. Although these are medium- and long-term objectives, Progress towards them can be tracked at the end of each financial year. Unless otherwise stated, the scope for CSR targets is the full Group. The specific values set for financial performance-related targets are not disclosed for the current financial year for confidentiality reasons and so as not to interfere with financial communications. Targets are set at levels that are designed to be both demanding and motivating. They aim to help the Group meet – and if possible exceed – its targets. On 26 February 2025, the Board of Directors decided to defer the finalisation of the Chief Executive Officer’s annual objectives until its next ordinary meeting. This postponement was made to accommodate the uncertain economic environment. It aims to ensure the objectives are set using the most up-to-date information available. 2.3. Other company officers 2.3.1. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS OF THE PARENT COMPANY The compensation policy for members of the Board of Directors is submitted for approval at the General Meeting. The compensation policy for members of the Board of Directors is submitted for approval at the General Meeting of Shareholders. According to this policy, the compensation provided for in Article L. 225-45 of the French Commercial Code shall be apportioned among the members of the Board of Directors, the standing committees and, where applicable, the “ad hoc” committees, in proportions to be determined by the Board of Directors after taking into consideration the recommendation Compensation Committee. The total amount of this compensation is apportioned: ■among those members attending meetings of the Board and its committees (Directors and Non-Voting Directors); ■in proportion to their actual attendance at such meetings, whether in person or remotely. Additional weightings are applied based on attendance, as follows: ■a coefficient of 2.0 applied to attendance by Chairmen at meetings of the committees they chair (each meeting attended counts double); ■a coefficient of 1.2 applied to attendance by Directors who live outside France and are not French tax residents at meetings of the Board and its committees. However, this extra weighting does not apply to Directors who are employees of a Group company. The compensation policy for members of the Board of Directors is attendance-based. It encourages participation in one or more committees. It aims to compensate the increased burden placed upon Directors who live outside France. It compensates the additional work undertaken by Committee Chairmen as well as their responsibility to the Board of Directors. They organise and oversee the work of their committees and report on it to the Board of Directors. 2.3.2. COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS OF SUBSIDIARIES Directorships held at Company subsidiaries are not compensated. This principle may be temporarily adapted in exceptional cases following the acquisition of listed companies."
"298 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Property, plant and equipment essentially consists of land and buildings, fixtures and fittings, office furniture and equipment, and IT equipment. Property, plant and equipment is measured at acquisition cost (excluding any borrowing costs) less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. No amounts have been remeasured. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the expected useful lives of each of the following fixed asset categories: ■buildings: 25 to 30 years; ■fixtures and fittings: 4 to 10 years; ■IT hardware and equipment: 3 to 8 years; ■vehicles: 4 to 5 years; ■office furniture and equipment: 4 to 10 years. Depreciation is applied against assets’ acquisition cost after deducting any residual value. Assets’ residual values and expected useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date.

"299 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Leases Leases are recognised in the balance sheet at the lease commencement date, which corresponds to the date at which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee, and results in the recognition of a balance sheet asset within Right-of-use assets and a liability within Lease liabilities. The value of lease liabilities corresponds to the present value of minimum future payments, discounted over the lease term using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or otherwise the incremental borrowing rate of the entity leasing the asset. The lease term chiefly reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease. The Group may adjust it, where it considers this to be reasonable, to reflect the period of a renewal or an extension option, which could be exercised, or an early termination option, which could be invoked where the corresponding penalties (contractual penalties and economic costs of doing so) would be more than negligible. At the lease commencement date, the value of the right-of- use asset recognised in the balance sheet corresponds to the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease, prepaid lease payments, incentives received from the lessor at that date, or costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset. Minimum future payments include fixed lease payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option, and termination or non-renewal penalties if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise or not exercise these options. Some of these values may change over the term of the lease, in which case the values of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are revised upward or downward. They do not include any service components that may be included in the lease, which continue to be recognised as expenses. In the balance sheet, Lease liabilities are split out into non- current and current portions. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset if the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee, or if the lessee is reasonably certain of exercising a purchase option. In the income statement, these amortisation expenses are included within Depreciation, amortisation, provisions and impairment under Operating profit on business activity. The Net interest expense on lease liabilities is split out from the line item Other financial income and expenses. Finally, as an exception, short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (individual value less than 5,000 USD) are directly recognised as expenses and are therefore not restated in the balance sheet. Variable lease payments are also recognised as expenses according to the use or revenue generated by the use of the underlying asset. 9.2. Breakdown of lease liabilities by maturity The lease amortisation schedule is as follows: (in millions of euros) Value of contractual flows Current Non-current Breakdown of non-current portion 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years More than 5 years LEASE LIABILITIES 475.4 115.2 360.2 94.1 71.1 49.1 40.7 105.1 NOTE 10 EQUITY‐ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 10.1.

"300 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.2. Carrying amount of investments in associates This note supplements the description of transactions set out in Note 2.2. The sale of most of the activities of Sopra Banking Software involved the transfer by the Group to Sopra GMT of 3.619 million of the 6.914 million shares it held in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). The sale was completed on 19 July 2024. It brought the Group’s stake in 74Software to around 15%. As part of the same transaction, the Group sold to Sopra GMT all its pre-emptive subscription rights to 74Software shares. As the latter funded the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software, in particular through a capital increase, the Group’s stake was diluted and only amounted to 11.1% following this transaction. The Group no longer exerts significant influence over 74Software, and the 74Software shares were reclassified under Non‐consolidated securities as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.A €11.1 million profit from sale of business, recognised in Other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.2.3), reflecting the loss of significant influence. The sale of pre-emptive subscription rights, in the amount of €10.2 million, is recognised in equity as an item not reclassifiable to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Through this operation, the Group received €106.2 million, including €10.2 million for the sale of pre-emptive subscription rights and €95.9 million for the sale of 3.619 million 74Software shares. As the sale of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares falls within the scope of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, they are no longer measured using the equity method. Accordingly, no profit from 74Software associated with the shares that were sold was recognised. The carrying amount of investments in associates consisted mainly of the value of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares until the date on which they were sold, with the remaining shares recognised under Non-consolidated securities. It changed as follows: (in millions of euros) Carrying amount 31 December 2022 183.5 Changes in scope 0.2 Dividend distribution -2.7 Profit for the period 6.7 Translation adjustments -2.3 Other comprehensive income -0.4 Other movements 0.8 31 December 2023 185.9 Changes in scope -190.3 Dividend distribution - Profit for the period -6.7 Translation adjustments 2.2 Other comprehensive income 0.0 Other movements 9.9 31 DECEMBER 2024 1.0 At 31 December 2023, Sopra Steria Group held a 31.96% stake in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). This stake did not give the Group a controlling interest in this subsidiary and did not allow it to involve itself in the running of the business or influence variable returns from this subsidiary. The Group thus exercised significant influence. Recognition and impairment of investments in associates Investments in associates are initially recognised at acquisition cost, and their value is then adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of their net assets. The remainder of this share appears under Equity-accounted investments on the asset side of the balance sheet. Its change over the financial year is recognised in profit or loss within Net profit from associates. Equity-accounted shares in a company constitute a single asset and must be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill on associates is included in the value of equity- accounted investments, the value of which is measured inclusive of goodwill. As such, goodwill on associates must not be tested for impairment separately. At each balance sheet date, where there is an indication of impairment of an investment in an associate, the parent company must carry out an impairment test consisting of comparing the carrying amount of the relevant equity- accounted investment with its recoverable amount. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is the higher of its value in use, calculated on the basis of future cash flows, and the fair value of the investment less costs of disposal. Where an associate’s shares are listed, fair value less costs of disposal is equal to market price less costs to sell: in the absence of any firm sale agreement, this is the price at which the shares are currently trading. Any impairment losses are charged to profit or loss as Other operating income and expenses. Where there is an improvement in the recoverable amount of an equity-accounted investment such that the impairment loss may be written back, the full amount of the impairment loss, including the portion relating to goodwill, must be written back."

The remainder corresponds to customer disputes, primarily in France, for €2.4 million. Provisions for tax risks other than income tax mainly concern risks relating to the R&D tax credit in France. Provisions for restructuring correspond to the cost of one-off restructuring measures, mainly in Germany (€0.9 million) and France (€1.7 million). Other provisions for contingencies mainly cover risks relating to clients and projects in the amount of €29.3 million (including €12.2 million in the United Kingdom, €7.9 million in France and €8.5 million in Germany), contractual risks (€6.8 million) and employee‐related risks (€4.2 million). Present obligations resulting from past events involving third parties are recognised in provisions only when it is probable that such obligations will give rise to an outflow of resources to third parties without consideration from said parties that is at least equivalent, and if the outflow of resources can be reliably measured. Since provisions are estimated based on future risks and expenses, such amounts include an element of uncertainty and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. The impact of discounting provisions is taken into account if significant. In the specific case of restructuring, an obligation is recognised as soon as the restructuring has been publicly announced and a detailed plan presented or the plan implementation has commenced. This cost mainly corresponds to severance payments, early retirement, costs related to notice periods not worked, training costs for departing employees and other costs relating to site closures. A provision is recognised for the rent and related costs to be paid, net of estimated subleasing income, in respect of any property if the asset is subleased or vacant and is not intended to be used in connection with main activities. Scrapped assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. 11.2. Contingent liabilities The contingent liabilities recognised arose as a result of the Sopra-Steria business combination in 2014. At 31 December 2024, they totalled €6.0 million after tax, corresponding to tax and contractual risks in India. To the extent that a liability is not probable or may not be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed by the Group among its commitments given. By exception, in connection with business combinations, the Group may recognise a contingent liability on the balance sheet if it results from a present obligation arising from past events and its fair value can be reliably estimated, even where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to extinguish the obligation."

"303 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Net cash and cash equivalents include available liquid funds (cash at bank and in hand), liquid marketable securities that meet the definition of cash equivalents, bills of exchange presented for collection and falling due before the balance sheet date, and temporary bank overdrafts. Net debt, as presented in Note 12.3, is more representative of the Group’s financial position. Marketable securities and other short-term investments include money-market holdings, short-term deposits and advances under the liquidity agreement. The risk of a change in value on these investments is negligible. Of the €423.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding current bank overdrafts) at 31 December 2024, €323.2 million was held by the parent company and €100.1 million by the subsidiaries. Among the subsidiaries, entities in India contributed €36.0 million to net cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 (versus €25.5 million at 31 December 2023). Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank demand deposits, other highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities as part of Financial debt – Short-term portion. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, with the exception of foreign exchange impacts. UCITS classified by the AMF (France’s financial markets regulator) as belonging to the “money market fund” and “short-term money market fund” categories are, for practical purposes, presumed to automatically meet all four quoted eligibility criteria. Other cash UCITS cannot be presumed to be eligible for classification as “cash equivalents”: an analysis must be carried out to establish whether or not the four quoted criteria are met. Cash equivalents are recognised at fair value; changes in fair value are charged to profit or loss under Cost of net financial debt. 12.3.

"304 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.3.2. Bank borrowings On 22 February 2022, the Group signed an agreement with its partner banks consisting of a €1,100 million non-amortising multi-currency credit facility tied to the achievement of environmental goals. Its ESG component does not constitute an embedded derivative. It is based on achieving a greenhouse gas emissions reduction aligned with a 1.5°C temperature increase scenario validated by SBTi for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and part of Scope 3. The target is to achieve a 68% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per employee by 2028 relative to a 2015 baseline. It is measured for each financial year and, if the target is met, will result in a 0.04% reduction per year in the applicable margin. In addition, the Company undertakes to pay an annual contribution equivalent to 0.04% of the margin applicable to sustainable projects, irrespective of whether it reaches the target. The Group’s achievement of its environmental performance targets in 2022 and 2023 made it possible to establish a dedicated fund of more than €0.2 million to fund innovative technology projects aimed at combating climate change. This agreement, with an initial term of five years, included two options to extend the expiry date by one year, exercised at the end of 2022 and 2023. The maturity of this credit facility is now set at 22 February 2029. At end-December 2024, this credit facility was undrawn. On 19 December 2023, the Group signed a contract with the same partner banks for a bank credit facility, drawn in the amount of €400 million, with a term of five years, comprised of a €280 million amortising tranche and a €120 million non- amortising tranche. This bank credit facility does not include an ESG component. Its balance at 31 December 2024 stood at €344.0 million. The Group also has several non-amortising bilateral bank facilities: some drawn to €67 million and others undrawn for €25 million, maturing in 2028. 12.3.3. Other financial debt In 2015, the Group arranged an unrated multi-currency NEU CP programme of short-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, in a maximum amount of €700 million. This programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was last updated in July 2024. The Group actively issued securities in 2024 and the average amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme grew, totalling €379.1 million in 2024, compared with €392.7 million in 2023. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme at 31 December 2024 was €99.0 million (€366.0 million at 31 December 2023), including floating-rate NEU CP amounting to €60.0 million and fixed-rate NEU CP amounting to €39.0 million. The NEU CPs are included in Other sundry financial debt. In December 2017, the Group arranged an NEU MTN programme of medium-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, with a maximum amount of €300 million. As was the case for the earlier NEU CP programme, the NEU MTN programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was updated in July 2024. The NEU MTN programme pays fixed or floating rates, with a spread at each issue date. Maturities range from one to five years. At 31 December 2024, the outstanding amount under the NEU MTN programme was €20.0 million, maturing in November 2025 (€10.0 million at 31 December 2023). The NEU MTNs are included in Other sundry financial debt. 12.4.

All financial instruments in this category are financial assets and liabilities classified as such upon first recognition. Financial debt is recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest rate. Hedging instruments may be put in place to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates by swapping part of the Group’s floating-rate debt for fixed-rate debt. The Group has entered into and continues to implement transactions designed to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk through the use of derivatives, including exchange-traded futures and options as well as over-the- counter instruments with top-tier counterparties, as part of its overall risk management policy and due to the substantial scale of its production activities in India, Poland and Tunisia."
"305 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Derivatives are recognised at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting are recognised directly in profit or loss for the period. Income tax receivables and payables are not financial instruments. The profit and loss impact of these financial instruments is as follows: (in millions of euros) 31/12/2024 Breakdown by category of instrument Profit or loss impact Fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through OCI Loans, receivables and other debt Liabilities at amortised cost Derivatives Total interest income 8.6 - 8.6 - - - Total interest expense -47.7 - - - -47.7 - Remeasurement 3.7 - - - - 3.7 NET GAINS OR LOSSES -35.4 - 8.6 - -47.7 3.7 The Group uses derivatives such as currency forwards, swaps and options to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk and fluctuations in foreign currencies. Derivatives are recognised at fair value. Any gains or losses resulting from fair value movements in derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recognised directly in profit or loss as Other financial income and expenses. The fair value of currency forwards is calculated by reference to current rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the market value of similar instruments. For hedge accounting purposes, hedges are classified as either: ■fair value hedges, which hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or a firm commitment (except foreign exchange risk); ■cash flow hedges, which hedge exposure to fluctuations in cash flows attributable either to a specific risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable future transaction or foreign exchange risk on a firm commitment; ■hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedging instruments that satisfy hedge accounting criteria are recognised as follows: a. Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge are recognised in profit or loss (Other current operating income and expenses or Other financial income and expenses according to the type of hedged item). The ineffective portion of the hedges is recognised in profit or loss as part of Other financial income or Other financial expenses, either over the term of the instrument for financial hedges, or at the date of the hedged purchase or sale for hedges of commercial risk. Fair value gains and losses on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item and are also recognised in profit or loss. b. Cash flow hedges The gain or loss corresponding to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is taken to profit or loss, in Other financial income and expenses. Gains and losses recognised directly in equity are released to profit or loss under Other comprehensive income in the period during which the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss. If the Group does not expect the realisation of the forecast transaction or commitment, the gains and losses previously recognised directly in equity will be released to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument matures, is sold, cancelled or exercised and is not replaced or renewed or if its designation as a hedging instrument is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity will be held in equity until realisation of the forecast transaction or firm commitment. c. Hedges of a net investment Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including hedges of monetary items recognised as part of a net investment, are recognised in Other comprehensive income. The gain or loss corresponding to the effective portion of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is taken to profit or loss. On the disposal of the foreign operation, cumulative gains and losses recognised directly in equity are released to profit or loss."
"306 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.5. Financial risk management 12.5.1. Liquidity risk The Group’s policy is to have credit facilities at its disposal that are much larger than its needs and to manage cash centrally at Group level where permitted by local law. Moreover, subsidiaries’ cash surpluses or borrowing requirements are managed centrally, being invested or met by the Sopra Steria Group parent company, which carries the bulk of the Group’s borrowings and bank credit facilities. As part of its efforts to diversify its borrowings, the Group has a €300 million NEU MTN programme to supplement its €700 million NEU CP programme launched in 2015. In 2024, the amounts received from the sale of Sopra Banking Software and 74Software (€416.7 million) were used to fund the share buyback programme (€106.9 million), gradually reduce the amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme and make investments in the form of certificates of deposit maturing in less than three months with members of the banking syndicate. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme was €99.0 million at 31 December 2024 (€366.0 million in December 2023). Bilateral credit facilities were in place for a total of €92.0 million, with maturities in 2028. At 31 December 2024, they were drawn down in the amount of €67.0 million. At 31 December 2024, the Group had credit facilities totalling €1,978 million, 34% of which was drawn down. Undrawn available credit lines amounted to €1,302 million (€1,100 million in RCFs and €25 million in bilateral credit facilities), in addition to undrawn overdraft facilities for €177 million. Aside from the syndicated loan, bilateral credit facilities and bonds, the Group’s financing essentially consists of issues under NEU CP (short-term commercial paper) and NEU MTN programmes. These financing sources break down as shown below: (in millions of euros) Amount authorised at 31/12/2024 Drawdown at 31/12/ 2024 Drawdown Repayment terms Interest rate at 31/ 12/2024 €m £m €m £m Bond 250.0 - 250.0 - 100% At maturity €130m 07/2026 €120m 07/2027 1.87% Syndicated loan ■Multi-currency revolving credit facility 1,100.0 - - 0% 02/2029 * ■Bank borrowings 344.0 344.0 - 100% Amortising tranche of €224m & tranche due at maturity of €120m, maturing 12/ 2028 4.09% Bilateral credit facilities 92.0 67.0 73% 2026 to 2028 4.62% Other 15.6 15.6 - 100% 2025 to 2026 3.01% Overdraft 176.5 - 0.0 N/A Total credit facilities authorised per currency 1,978.1 - 676.6 - TOTAL CREDIT FACILITIES AUTHORISED (€ EQUIVALENT) 1,978.1 676.6 34% 3.30% Other types of financing used NEU CP & NEU MTN 119.0 2025 4.02% Other 10.0 2025 Total financing per currency 805.5 - TOTAL FINANCING (€ EQUIVALENT) 805.5 3.36% * The two one‐year extension options were exercised and unanimously approved by lenders in February 2023 and December 2023. Interest rates payable on the syndicated loan equal the interbank rate of the currency concerned at the time of drawdown (minimum 0%), plus a margin set for a period of six months based on the leverage ratio. The €250 million bond issued on 5 July 2019 has an effective interest rate of 1.749% for the €130 million tranche and 2% for the €120 million tranche. The bond issue is subject to terms and conditions, which include financial covenants. Two financial ratios are calculated every six months using the consolidated financial statements on a 12-month rolling basis: ■the first – known as the leverage ratio – is equal to net financial debt divided by pro forma EBITDA; ■the second – known as the interest coverage ratio – is equal to pro forma EBITDA divided by the cost of net financial debt. The first financial ratio must not exceed 3.0 at any reporting date. The second ratio must not fall below 5.0. Net financial debt is defined on a consolidated basis as all loans and related borrowings (excluding intercompany liabilities and lease liabilities), less available cash and cash equivalents. Pro forma EBITDA is Consolidated operating profit on business activity adding back depreciation, amortisation and provisions included in Operating profit on business activity before the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (see Note 1.6.1). It is calculated on a 12-month rolling basis and is therefore restated so as to be presented in the financial statements at constant scope over 12 months."
"299 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Leases Leases are recognised in the balance sheet at the lease commencement date, which corresponds to the date at which the lessor makes the underlying asset available to the lessee, and results in the recognition of a balance sheet asset within Right-of-use assets and a liability within Lease liabilities. The value of lease liabilities corresponds to the present value of minimum future payments, discounted over the lease term using either the interest rate implicit in the lease or otherwise the incremental borrowing rate of the entity leasing the asset. The lease term chiefly reflects the non-cancellable period of the lease. The Group may adjust it, where it considers this to be reasonable, to reflect the period of a renewal or an extension option, which could be exercised, or an early termination option, which could be invoked where the corresponding penalties (contractual penalties and economic costs of doing so) would be more than negligible. At the lease commencement date, the value of the right-of- use asset recognised in the balance sheet corresponds to the lease liability adjusted for any initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease, prepaid lease payments, incentives received from the lessor at that date, or costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset. Minimum future payments include fixed lease payments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, residual value guarantees, the exercise price of a purchase option, and termination or non-renewal penalties if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise or not exercise these options. Some of these values may change over the term of the lease, in which case the values of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets are revised upward or downward. They do not include any service components that may be included in the lease, which continue to be recognised as expenses. In the balance sheet, Lease liabilities are split out into non- current and current portions. Right-of-use assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset if the lease transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee, or if the lessee is reasonably certain of exercising a purchase option. In the income statement, these amortisation expenses are included within Depreciation, amortisation, provisions and impairment under Operating profit on business activity. The Net interest expense on lease liabilities is split out from the line item Other financial income and expenses. Finally, as an exception, short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (individual value less than 5,000 USD) are directly recognised as expenses and are therefore not restated in the balance sheet. Variable lease payments are also recognised as expenses according to the use or revenue generated by the use of the underlying asset. 9.2. Breakdown of lease liabilities by maturity The lease amortisation schedule is as follows: (in millions of euros) Value of contractual flows Current Non-current Breakdown of non-current portion 1 to 2 years 2 to 3 years 3 to 4 years 4 to 5 years More than 5 years LEASE LIABILITIES 475.4 115.2 360.2 94.1 71.1 49.1 40.7 105.1 NOTE 10 EQUITY‐ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS 10.1.

"300 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.2. Carrying amount of investments in associates This note supplements the description of transactions set out in Note 2.2. The sale of most of the activities of Sopra Banking Software involved the transfer by the Group to Sopra GMT of 3.619 million of the 6.914 million shares it held in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). The sale was completed on 19 July 2024. It brought the Group’s stake in 74Software to around 15%. As part of the same transaction, the Group sold to Sopra GMT all its pre-emptive subscription rights to 74Software shares. As the latter funded the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software, in particular through a capital increase, the Group’s stake was diluted and only amounted to 11.1% following this transaction. The Group no longer exerts significant influence over 74Software, and the 74Software shares were reclassified under Non‐consolidated securities as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.A €11.1 million profit from sale of business, recognised in Other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.2.3), reflecting the loss of significant influence. The sale of pre-emptive subscription rights, in the amount of €10.2 million, is recognised in equity as an item not reclassifiable to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Through this operation, the Group received €106.2 million, including €10.2 million for the sale of pre-emptive subscription rights and €95.9 million for the sale of 3.619 million 74Software shares. As the sale of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares falls within the scope of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, they are no longer measured using the equity method. Accordingly, no profit from 74Software associated with the shares that were sold was recognised. The carrying amount of investments in associates consisted mainly of the value of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares until the date on which they were sold, with the remaining shares recognised under Non-consolidated securities. It changed as follows: (in millions of euros) Carrying amount 31 December 2022 183.5 Changes in scope 0.2 Dividend distribution -2.7 Profit for the period 6.7 Translation adjustments -2.3 Other comprehensive income -0.4 Other movements 0.8 31 December 2023 185.9 Changes in scope -190.3 Dividend distribution - Profit for the period -6.7 Translation adjustments 2.2 Other comprehensive income 0.0 Other movements 9.9 31 DECEMBER 2024 1.0 At 31 December 2023, Sopra Steria Group held a 31.96% stake in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). This stake did not give the Group a controlling interest in this subsidiary and did not allow it to involve itself in the running of the business or influence variable returns from this subsidiary. The Group thus exercised significant influence. Recognition and impairment of investments in associates Investments in associates are initially recognised at acquisition cost, and their value is then adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of their net assets. The remainder of this share appears under Equity-accounted investments on the asset side of the balance sheet. Its change over the financial year is recognised in profit or loss within Net profit from associates. Equity-accounted shares in a company constitute a single asset and must be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill on associates is included in the value of equity- accounted investments, the value of which is measured inclusive of goodwill. As such, goodwill on associates must not be tested for impairment separately. At each balance sheet date, where there is an indication of impairment of an investment in an associate, the parent company must carry out an impairment test consisting of comparing the carrying amount of the relevant equity- accounted investment with its recoverable amount. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is the higher of its value in use, calculated on the basis of future cash flows, and the fair value of the investment less costs of disposal. Where an associate’s shares are listed, fair value less costs of disposal is equal to market price less costs to sell: in the absence of any firm sale agreement, this is the price at which the shares are currently trading. Any impairment losses are charged to profit or loss as Other operating income and expenses. Where there is an improvement in the recoverable amount of an equity-accounted investment such that the impairment loss may be written back, the full amount of the impairment loss, including the portion relating to goodwill, must be written back."

The remainder corresponds to customer disputes, primarily in France, for €2.4 million. Provisions for tax risks other than income tax mainly concern risks relating to the R&D tax credit in France. Provisions for restructuring correspond to the cost of one-off restructuring measures, mainly in Germany (€0.9 million) and France (€1.7 million). Other provisions for contingencies mainly cover risks relating to clients and projects in the amount of €29.3 million (including €12.2 million in the United Kingdom, €7.9 million in France and €8.5 million in Germany), contractual risks (€6.8 million) and employee‐related risks (€4.2 million). Present obligations resulting from past events involving third parties are recognised in provisions only when it is probable that such obligations will give rise to an outflow of resources to third parties without consideration from said parties that is at least equivalent, and if the outflow of resources can be reliably measured. Since provisions are estimated based on future risks and expenses, such amounts include an element of uncertainty and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. The impact of discounting provisions is taken into account if significant. In the specific case of restructuring, an obligation is recognised as soon as the restructuring has been publicly announced and a detailed plan presented or the plan implementation has commenced. This cost mainly corresponds to severance payments, early retirement, costs related to notice periods not worked, training costs for departing employees and other costs relating to site closures. A provision is recognised for the rent and related costs to be paid, net of estimated subleasing income, in respect of any property if the asset is subleased or vacant and is not intended to be used in connection with main activities. Scrapped assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. 11.2. Contingent liabilities The contingent liabilities recognised arose as a result of the Sopra-Steria business combination in 2014. At 31 December 2024, they totalled €6.0 million after tax, corresponding to tax and contractual risks in India. To the extent that a liability is not probable or may not be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed by the Group among its commitments given. By exception, in connection with business combinations, the Group may recognise a contingent liability on the balance sheet if it results from a present obligation arising from past events and its fair value can be reliably estimated, even where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to extinguish the obligation."

"303 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Net cash and cash equivalents include available liquid funds (cash at bank and in hand), liquid marketable securities that meet the definition of cash equivalents, bills of exchange presented for collection and falling due before the balance sheet date, and temporary bank overdrafts. Net debt, as presented in Note 12.3, is more representative of the Group’s financial position. Marketable securities and other short-term investments include money-market holdings, short-term deposits and advances under the liquidity agreement. The risk of a change in value on these investments is negligible. Of the €423.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding current bank overdrafts) at 31 December 2024, €323.2 million was held by the parent company and €100.1 million by the subsidiaries. Among the subsidiaries, entities in India contributed €36.0 million to net cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 (versus €25.5 million at 31 December 2023). Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank demand deposits, other highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities as part of Financial debt – Short-term portion. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, with the exception of foreign exchange impacts. UCITS classified by the AMF (France’s financial markets regulator) as belonging to the “money market fund” and “short-term money market fund” categories are, for practical purposes, presumed to automatically meet all four quoted eligibility criteria. Other cash UCITS cannot be presumed to be eligible for classification as “cash equivalents”: an analysis must be carried out to establish whether or not the four quoted criteria are met. Cash equivalents are recognised at fair value; changes in fair value are charged to profit or loss under Cost of net financial debt. 12.3.

Borrowings are subsequently recognised at amortised cost; any difference between the capital amounts borrowed (net of transaction costs) and the amounts repayable is recognised in profit or loss over the duration of the borrowings using the effective interest method; ■NEU CP short-term negotiable securities, which have a maturity of less than 12 months and are recognised at amortised cost; ■NEU MTN medium-term negotiable securities, which have maturities spread over one to five years from issuance, and are recognised at amortised cost; ■current bank overdrafts. Financial debt repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date is classified as current liabilities. 12.3.1. Bonds On 5 July 2019, the Group issued a €250 million bond to top-ranking institutional investors. The bond has two tranches: a 7-year €130 million bond with a fixed annual coupon of 1.749%, and an 8-year €120 million tranche with a fixed annual coupon of 2.0%."
