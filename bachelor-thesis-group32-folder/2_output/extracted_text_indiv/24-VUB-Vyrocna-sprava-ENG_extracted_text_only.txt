The implementation of the Code of Ethics has resulted in supplementary policies and procedures aimed at speci昀椀c areas of operations. For resource procurement, it is the Green Banking Procurement Rules that ensure responsible purchasing in areas such as energy, of昀椀ce materials, and sustainable renovations via identi昀椀cation of the best design solutions, products, or services from an environmental perspective throughout its life cycle, considering market availability. Key impacts considered include energy consumption and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions, waste generation, and the consumption of materials such as paper, toner, stationery, and of昀椀ce machines. The choice of supplier takes into account not only its specialization in the required product 昀椀eld and its economic and 昀椀nancial stability but also its reputational and sustainability pro昀椀le across all ESG areas. This includes assessing potential external risks, such as ongoing judicial and insolvency proceedings. In its operations, the Group adheres to the Environmental and Energy Policy of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. This policy aims to minimize environmental impacts, manage ESG risks, and ensure compliance with regulations. It emphasizes ef昀椀cient resource and energy use, careful supplier selection based on ethical, social, and environmental criteria, and the prevention of environmental harm. The Guidelines for the Governance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks address climate change within the broader context of environmental risks across operations, the value chain, and the 昀椀nanced portfolio. These guidelines aim to mitigate material risks associated with climate change and support the transition to a low- carbon economy. The guidelines establish a framework for managing sustainability risks, stating key principles, specifying sectors sensitive to ESG or reputational risks, de昀椀ning responsibilities, and monitoring mechanisms. The core focus is placed on limiting exposure to high-carbon industries, integrating ESG risk factors into credit policies, and promoting sustainable 昀椀nancing solutions. The effectiveness of the policy is monitored through internal limits, ESG Committee oversight, and risk appetite thresholds. The guidelines apply across the entire Group, including all banking activities, risk management processes, and 昀椀nancing operations. They cover both corporate and retail portfolios, ensuring ESG factors are assessed in client screenings and sectoral risk evaluations. Exclusions apply primarily to the coal mining and oil and gas sectors, where stricter rules aim at phasing out exposure for coil mining. The policy aligns with international sustainability frameworks, including the UN 2030 Agenda, the European Commission’s Action Plan for Sustainable Growth, the EBA Guidelines, and ECB expectations. The policy takes into account the interests of key stakeholders, including regulators, investors, and clients, by balancing 昀椀nancial stability with sustainability goals. In lending activities, sustainability-linked 昀椀nancing and advisory services are provided to help clients transition to greener business models. The policy is integrated into internal governance frameworks and embedded in the Group’s risk appetite and credit policies, which de昀椀ne VUB Group’s lending portfolio strategy for each relevant sector based on ESG aspects, among others. Relevant guidelines are communicated to stakeholders through corporate reports, regulatory disclosures, and direct engagement with clients and investors. In order to steer the development of 昀椀nanced portfolio, the Group equipped itself with Rules for the classi昀椀cation of sustainable credit products and operations. This regulation applies to Group companies and outlines various categories of environmentally sustainable activities, with internal criteria different from the European Taxonomy, in favour of both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The classi昀椀cation categories of credit products and sustainable credit operations have been de昀椀ned in line with the internationally recognized guidelines of the Loan Market Association (LMA) on Green Loan, Social Loan and Sustainability-linked Loan Principles. These principles provide a shared framework at a global level, promoting standardization and transparency of practices in the sustainable 昀椀nancial sector.

"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 347 and commercial real estate. The impact of climate-related hazards on 昀椀nanced non-昀椀nancial corporate clients was assessed using sector-speci昀椀c heatmaps, geolocation data across the relevant time horizons according to the maturity, applying NGFS and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios, providing insights into the potential future exposure and physical risk. To ensure a more precise risk assessment, loan portfolios were categorized based on maturity buckets (<5Y, 5-10Y, 10-20Y, >20Y) of the exposure. This approach, while distinct from the broader time horizons used in the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA), provides a more detailed perspective on risk distribution over time. With reference to physical risks of own operations the effective operational losses caused by disasters and other related events (operational risk) were considered. This includes meteorological phenomena, earthquakes, and 昀氀oods that could disrupt business continuity and cause 昀椀nancial losses. Based on the assessment performed, physical climate risks have been consistently identi昀椀ed as low or very low across all time horizons and traditional 昀椀nancial risk categories (credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk), thus reinforcing a stable risk pro昀椀le of the Group. With reference to the transition risks, the following analyses were carried out for the different reference perimeters identi昀椀ed: – Own operations: Operational risks (e.g., regulatory changes, energy transition requirements) and reputational risks related to any initiatives that may not align with Group's own sustainability commitments and climate objectives were assessed. This included evaluating potential challenges in adapting our operations to mitigate climate change impacts effectively; – Upstream value chain: Operational and reputational risks were evaluated concerning our suppliers. Specifically, the risk of engaging suppliers with insufficient or inadequate climate-related measures, such as inadequate management of greenhouse gas emissions. The potential for supply chain disruptions linked to the transition towards low-carbon alternatives were also examined; – Downstream value chain: Credit, market, and liquidity risks potentially arising from exposure to transition risks, such as changes in consumer demand, regulatory pressures, or shifts in market sentiment were assessed. The reputational risks related to Group's products and services, especially in light of evolving sustainability preferences among customers and stakeholders were also considered. Additionally, liquidity risks arising from the potential loss of institutional investors in case of failure to meet climate-related expectations were analysed, as that could affect access to capital and the Group’s financial stability. The identi昀椀ed transition events and their potential impacts on assets and business activities are as follows: – Short-term: Events such as increased pricing of GHG emissions, enhanced emissions-reporting obligations, and potential legal mandates on existing products or services. These events may lead to higher costs and changes in consumer behaviour; – Medium-term: Risks related to the failure of counterparties to define a transition plan, such as market risks and credit risks. These may affect the value of corporate bonds and the ability of counterparties to service debts, particularly if they fail to transition to a low-emission economy; – Long-term: The company may face reputational risks and potential exposure to litigation related to failure to meet climate targets or align with climate-related goals like those of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. These risks are linked to long-term exposure to regulatory changes and the transition to a low-carbon economy. The assessment of transition risks and opportunities has been primarily based on: – An analysis of real estate collateral and their EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) label, providing an overview of the energy efficiency distribution within the loan portfolio; – ESG sectoral assessment approach for Non-financial corporations (NFCs). This approach, common for all members of the ISP Group, provides a prudent, worst-case-scenario estimate of the NFCs susceptibility to a set of risk drivers, including, among others, physical, transition and environmental risk. This approach is mainly based on qualitative external sources analysis (qualitative top-down element) complemented by leveraging the granular and forward-looking results of the scenario analysis (quantitative bottom-up element). The top-down element analyses economic sectors’ vulnerability to C&E risks at large drawing on several external sources, thus leveraging on multiple perspectives in reaching a conversant evaluation. The bottom-up element leverages on climate stressed counterparty-level data, providing a more granular and forward-looking insight into the underlying vulnerabilities of the NFC portfolio. Together, these approaches help identify and qualify the risks economic sectors are exposed to; – A similar screening of individual borrowers, assessing their performance in ESG area through internally developed ISP Group ESG score. The Group identi昀椀ed several assets that need signi昀椀cant efforts to be compatible with a transition to a climate- neutral economy, especially within the 2030 milestone. These assets are mostly connected with downstream value"

"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 354 resources to areas of the highest impact. Successful implementation is also contingent on access to appropriate technologies, employee expertise, and supportive regulatory frameworks. Climate change actions and resources at the portfolio level In line with the regulatory evolution on sustainability, the Group adopts a medium-long term strategy and a cross- cutting and holistic approach to ESG issues, which is based on: – The definition of a Group ESG strategy; – The integration of ESG factors into the general Risk Management framework, particularly within the Risk Appetite Framework, where a specific section is dedicated to ESG risks and climate change; – The integration of ESG factors in credit processes and in the definition of credit strategies; – A careful evaluation of ESG factors in the development of policies, products and services; – The spread of ESG risk culture throughout the corporate organization. With reference to climate change mitigation, the integration of ESG risks into the Risk Management framework takes place through various actions. In particular, the RAF integrates and translates into speci昀椀c measures what is de昀椀ned in terms of strategic guidelines, ESG/Climate Materiality Assessment and ESG Sectoral Colour Coding, identifying year by year limits, Key Risk Indicators, and speci昀椀c actions aimed at containing ESG risks, with particular reference to the sectors most exposed to such risks. – Specific limits with reference to exposure to the Coal Mining and Oil & Gas sectors, particularly for Coal mining the limit is revised annually in line with the objective of phasing out financing by 2025; – The monitoring of new disbursements broken down by energy performance classes (EPC) with the aim of improving the quality of residential properties taken as collateral and, consequently, reducing the transition risk related to mortgage loans; – Specific Risk appetite limits on share of collateral with EPC classes F and G and with Very high physical risk in the Retail Mortgage portfolio, with the aim of improving the quality of residential properties taken as collateral and consequently, reducing the risk of transition and physical risk related to mortgage loans. In particular, with reference to the lower energy performance classes (APE certifications) and areas with very high physical risk; – Transactions with potentially high ESG risks undergo ESG & Reputational Risk Clearing process, utilizing the ESG profile and score of the counterparty and considerations on the impacts that physical and transition risk drivers can have. Within the ESG & Reputational Risk Clearing process, where the ESG pro昀椀le and score of the counterparty are used, which also includes considerations on the impacts that physical climate risk drivers might have. The actions reported are implemented as an essential part of the Group's strategy for managing climate risks and do not require speci昀椀c dedicated resources exclusively for these actions, as they are included in the general context of the Group's ESG strategy. An exact quanti昀椀cation of the reduction of emissions associated with each action at portfolio level is not feasible, due to the complex connection between the actions taken and the trend of emissions in the reference sectors of the counterparties. In 2024, the VUB Group continued its commitment to retail customers, both individual and small business, through the provision of mortgages and loans with environmental purposes. Via Green mortgages, the VUB Bank incentivizes clients with a preferential interest rate for 昀椀nancing a purchase of a property with high energy performance class (‘A’). Clients with other properties are encouraged to assess their energy ef昀椀ciency and when they provide a valid EPC, they receive a reduction of loan granting fee. In addition to offering a new mortgage the VUB Group has implemented a series of activities aimed at collecting the information on the energy performance of the properties that guarantee existing mortgages, which further raises awareness among clients and allow the Bank to precisely manage the associated transition risk. Green loan is a 昀椀nancial solution with incentive for clients who want to improve energy performance through, for example, the replacement of windows and high-yield boilers, insulation and the installation of solar and photovoltaic panels. To support sustainable transition of SME and Corporate clients, the VUB Bank introduced the TERRA product line, offering loans with preferential interest rates to support sustainability in areas of environmental, social and governance sustainability. Within the TERRA Enviro two products are offered: – GREEN S-LOAN+: Dedicated loan to support all types of corporate investments and projects capable of generating a positive environmental impact on processes, infrastructures, technologies, services and products in line with the LMA categorization (e.g., Renewable energies, Energy efficiency, Pollution prevention and control, environmentally sustainable management of natural resources, Clean transportation, Sustainable water and"
"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 355 wastewater management, Climate change adaptation, Eco-efficient and/or circular economy, Green buildings or Projects aimed at activities with zero CO2 emissions, such as electricity production using solar, wind, oceanic, hydroelectric technology). – ENVIRO LOAN: Dedicated loan supporting circular economy projects, including resource efficiency, sustainable sourcing, recyclability, and green innovation. For these loans, individual ESG KPIs can be set up with the client. Below is a summary of the total amount disbursed during the 2024 昀椀nancial year in the 昀椀eld environmental sustainability by business line: Business line Disbursed amount (in million EUR) Retail 599.2 Corporate 187.4 Amount disbursed in Retail Business line relates predominantly to Mortgage loan with EPC A and B. The disbursed data of the 昀椀nancings are calculated using management balances. The VUB Group supports sustainable choices of clients also in the area of investments. Please refer to the standard ESRS S4 – Consumers and end-users, section Sustainability-conscious investments by the VUB Group. Actions and resources related to supply chain To manage the impacts from value chain each vendor undergoes a quali昀椀cation process through the Supplier Portal. The evaluation of registered suppliers considers not only their economic-昀椀nancial and technical-organizational characteristics but also aspects related to business ethics, respect for human rights, workers' rights, and the environment. This evaluation is based on speci昀椀c questionnaires and/or the possession of certain certi昀椀cations (including ISO 50001 and 14001, and the adoption of an energy management system compliant with ISO 50001 standards). In 2024, completing the ESG questionnaire became mandatory as a prerequisite for participating in tenders or direct negotiations through the Supplier Portal and the ESG evaluation was incorporated into the technical assessment of the supplier’s offer in the tender evaluation."
"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 358 Scope 1 – Direct GHG emissions include emissions from sources owned or controlled by the Group: – The natural gas used for independent heating. The calculation is based on consumption data from meter readings, and emission factors by UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change); – The fuel used for the car fleet, including diesel used in back-up electricity diesel generators. The calculation is based on GPS monitoring of distance travelled, and invoices of fuel consumed by each individual vehicle (diesel, gasoline, gasoline-hybrid vehicles), regulatory infrastructure tests and servicing protocols of emergency generators, and emission factors are sourced from ISPRA (Instituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale); – The leaks of F-gases (fluorinated gases used as refrigerants). The calculation is based on servicing and maintenance protocols of respective equipment, and emission factors from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The value of leaks in year 2024 was zero. Scope 2 – Indirect emissions result from the purchased or acquired energy generated off-site and consumed by the Group: – Electricity – The calculation is based on the fossil fuel-based electricity purchased from the supplier, documented by the invoices and meter readings, and emission factors using two approaches: o Market-based. The emission factor used is the ‘2023 residual mix’ factor for Slovakia, calculated by Intesa Sanpaolo. o Location-based. The emission factor used is ‘2023 national mix’ factor for Slovakia, obtained from International Energy Agency. – Thermal energy – fossil fuels district heating for central heating system. The calculation is based on natural gas consumption data acquired from a part of the lessors. For the remaining leased premises where the consumption data are not available an average consumption value per square meter was used. Emission factor was used from UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Scope 3 – category 1. The acquisitions of goods and services concerned: – The paper used in office activities. The processes considered are those ranging from production to delivery to the Group. Emissions from production represent an average industry scenario, obtained thanks to the British government's conversion factors for reporting greenhouse gases. For all processes within the system boundaries, greenhouse gas emission factors were obtained from Ecoinvent 3.5. The IPCC 2013 equivalence factors were applied; – The use of datacentre services in the cloud. The annual Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions reported by suppliers are considered, relative to the services offered to the Group. Scope 3 – category 2. Regarding instrumental goods, the most relevant computer and electronic equipment purchased by the Group during the reference year are considered: PCs and laptops, monitors, printers, smartphones, tablets, ATMs, etc. Scope 3 – category 3. In the energy vector indicator, related to the Group's energy consumption, emissions related to the fuel supply chain, construction and operation of infrastructure, distribution and transmission losses are included. To characterize the impacts, regional data were used where possible, along with average European or global scenarios. Regarding electricity consumption, country-speci昀椀c ‘residual mix’ was used. Ecoinvent 3.5 emission factors were used, and IPCC 2013 equivalence factors were applied. Scope 3 – category 4. Regarding transportation and upstream distribution, emissions generated by the transportation of cash for ATM replenishment carried out by third-party companies on behalf of the Group are accounted for. To model the system, a transport with vans was assumed. Emissions include all phases of the life cycle: fuel supply chain, combustion emissions, and vehicle manufacturing. Emission factors from Ecoinvent 3.5 were used. Scope 3 – category 5. The waste-related emissions include the end-of-life treatment of special waste generated by the activities carried out by the Group. The evaluated phases include the transport of waste to treatment plants, as well as end-of-life treatment. For the remaining waste 昀氀ows sent to land昀椀lls, incineration or other treatment processes, the emission factors representative of Ecoinvent 3.5 were used. The IPCC 2013 equivalence factors were applied. Scope 3 – category 6. Emissions related to business travel are excluded from the signi昀椀cant emission stream. Scope 3 – category 7. Emissions due to home-to-work commuting of personnel are not calculated and are excluded. Scope 3 – category 8. Emissions related to upstream leased assets are excluded from the signi昀椀cant emissions stream. Scope 3 – category 10. Processing of sold products is excluded from the signi昀椀cant emission stream."
"ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystems 367 – Downstream value chain: Credit risk and market risk potentially arising from threats to biodiversity and the balance of the reference ecosystems were mainly considered. This could also determine elements of risk from a reputational perspective. The assessment results concluded that no risks were identi昀椀ed relating to the direct or indirect impact on the loss of biodiversity, the extension and conditions of ecosystems nor within its own operations nor within its upstream value chain perimeter. The Reputational Risk to which the Group is exposed if it resorts to suppliers who adopt less structured controls with reference to biodiversity and ecosystems has been assessed and evaluated as not material. The materiality analysis conducted for the standard in question, with reference to transition and physical risks related to biodiversity and ecosystems, relies on models and metrics that are still evolving, both in terms of methodology and standardization. In this regard, the development of reference methodological standards and the availability of increasingly granular and reliable data will enable further re昀椀nement of the materiality analysis and the incorporation of additional analytical elements. After performing the double materiality analysis, over all de昀椀ned time horizons, no material impacts, risks or opportunities related to Biodiversity and Ecosystems were identi昀椀ed. The VUB Group does not own or have an operational control over any relevant speci昀椀c sites of shared biological resources and ecosystems, raw materials production or sourcing that are near biodiversity-sensitive areas. Consequently, it does not engage in activities that negatively affect these areas or that may have negative or potential negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems or affected communities. VUB Group's assets are not classi昀椀ed as shared biological resources or ecosystems and, therefore, biodiversity mitigation measures are not considered relevant."
"ESRS E5 – Resource use and circular economy 369 With reference to risks, the following analyses were conducted: – Own operations: In consideration of the specificity of the VUB Group's core business and following in-depth analyses with the dedicated structures, no risks were identified relating to the topic of circular economy and use of resources; – Upstream value chain: The reputational risk to which the VUB Group is potentially exposed was mainly assessed, in the event that it uses suppliers who adopt less structured controls with respect to the topic in question (for example, lack of definition of an environmental policy); – Downstream value chain: The credit risk and the market risk potentially deriving from threats to the circular economy and the use of resources were mainly considered. This could also determine elements of risk from a reputational perspective. From the analyses conducted, for the purposes of 昀椀nancial materiality, signi昀椀cant reputational risks relating to waste management in the production process were identi昀椀ed, for both downstream and upstream value chain. With reference to the 昀椀nancial materiality of the opportunities, analyses were conducted mainly relating to the downstream value chain, taking into account the type of business of the VUB Group and the peculiarity of the 昀椀nancial activities. Analyses and evaluations of commercial opportunities were carried out in terms of 昀椀nancing of counterparties with the aim of improving their circular economy pro昀椀les and improving the ef昀椀ciency of production processes. Additionally, the possible presence of objectives and performance indicators related to the VUB Group's Strategy was considered. In light of the 昀椀nancial materiality analysis carried out, no signi昀椀cant opportunities emerged. Policies, actions and objectives related to resource use and circular economy Policies related to resource use and circular economy The circular economy policies of the VUB Group are in line with Intesa Sanpaolo Group's strategy, focusing on resource ef昀椀ciency, waste reduction, and value creation throughout the product life cycle. The goal is to facilitate the transition of businesses and territories to an inclusive circular economy, enhancing climate change mitigation, biodiversity restoration, and pollution reduction. This approach optimizes raw material use, regenerates natural resources, and fosters technological innovation, contributing to a sustainable, equitable, and resilient economic system. These policies cover all the VUB Group's activities, emphasizing internal resource management and 昀椀nancial support for circular business models, aligning with global sustainability trends and reducing resource price volatility risks. The Code of Ethics of the VUB Group integrates the principles of circular economy through environmental protection, support for the development of the country thanks to the ecological transition and the adoption of circular economy models, as well as through responsible management of indirect environmental impacts. Furthermore, the VUB Group adopted the following internal policies related to the circular economy in various areas: – In direct relation to the European Taxonomy, the Rules for the application of the European Taxonomy from a Green Asset Ratio (GAR) perspective, approved at Intesa Sanpaolo Group level and prepared in compliance with regulatory legislation, with the aim of outlining the rules necessary for the application of the EU Taxonomy and measurement of aligned economic activities with the fourth of the six environmental objectives set out in European legislation, namely ‘Transition to a circular economy’; – The Rules for the classification of sustainable credit products and lending transactions, which identifies a specific category in the field of environmental sustainability called ‘Ecological efficiency and circular economy’ assigned on the basis of the consistency of the credit transaction to a specific framework of five Circular Economy criteria, defined in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF); – The ESG Scoring Rules outline how Intesa Sanpaolo Group and VUB Group evaluate the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of its corporate clients, including SMEs that are often excluded from market ESG ratings. The ESG Score is used in key banking processes, such as: o Credit Risk Appetite Framework – defines the Bank’s willingness to take on risk for different customer categories; o Credit Strategies Framework – guides credit portfolio growth to balance risk and return over time. The ESG Score is a comprehensive rating based on multiple factors, including a speci昀椀c focus on the circular economy. – The Rules of operations, governing the waste hierarchy (prevention, preparing for re-use, recycling, other recovery, disposal), waste avoidance, minimization, separate collection and ways of disposal;"
