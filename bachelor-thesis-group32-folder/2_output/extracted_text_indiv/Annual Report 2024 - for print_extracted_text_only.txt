"78 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures In 2024, ASSA ABLOY continued to explore and understand the requirements of the TCFD. We are gradually developing the process of reporting to the TCFD, to ensure it is meaningful and helpful in guiding our organization to make informed decisions based on climate-related risk and opportunity. We are firmly convinced the TCFD framework will enable us to identify and navigate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. We carried out our third climate scenario analysis during the year. The analysis reviewed the risks and opportunities of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks, to 2030 and 2050. The two different climate scenarios we reviewed were developed by the UN International Panel on Climate Control (IPCC): RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. The two scenario analyses were used to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities over the short and medium term to 2030, as well as the long- term to 2050. RCP 2.6, called Realizing the Paris Agreement, is a scenario where emissions decline rapidly over the coming decades, resulting in a temperature increase up to 2.3°C warmer by the end of the century. RCP 6, called The Rocky Road, is a scenario where emissions are declining at an insufficient rate and not to the level required, resulting in a temperature in­ crease up to 3.7°C warmer by the end of the century. Scenario analysis During the scenario analysis we added more context, where we tried to understand both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, especially for climate-relat­ ed risk. We developed the process to be able to quan­ tify our climate-related risk, in terms of percentage of sales from low risk to very high risk. Depending on the level of risk (from low to very high), the financial risk is then determined as percentage impact on total annu­ al sales. The analysis reviewed risks and opportunities relating to two different climate scenarios and how they could impact ASSA ABLOY’s business in 2030 and 2050. The outcomes are summarized in the blocks to the right. The Rocky Road – RCP 6 Temperature increases between 2 – 3.7°C Increased extreme weather events Fossil fuel-generated energy, poor air quality Forced migration Increased areas of water stress Ocean levels rising Opportunities/risks as a % of annual sales Low <1 % Medium 2–5% High 6–10% Very high is >10% Opportunities • Producing locally, a competitive advantage • Increased solution requirements • Technology will be a solution enabler • New markets • Increased focus on security Risks: Physical Risk (PR), Transition Risk (TR) • Coastal factories at risk of flooding (PR) • Supply chain uncertainty (TR) • Materials availability (TR) • Customer expectation (TR) • Ability to get insurance (TR) • Higher costs for emissions (TR) Realizing the Paris Agreement – RCP 2.6 Temperature increases between 0.9 – 2.3°C Lower frequency of extreme weather events Large-scale installed renewable energy Robust energy legislation and carbon taxes High energy effectiveness and efficiency Opportunities • New solutions reducing customers’ environmental footprint • Transition to circular economy • Local production will be an advantage • Increased resource efficiency Risks: Physical Risk (PR), Transition Risk (TR) • Availability of low-carbon materials (TR) • Need to upgrade and retrofit older sites (PR & TR) • Carbon taxes and market regulations (TR) • Customer expectation (TR) • M&A in higher risk geographies (TR) • Energy quality and availability (TR) Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors"
"79 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 For the climate scenarios we have applied two time horizons (2030) and (2050) which is in line with the Paris Agreement. However, for greenhouse gas reduc­ tion targets the time horizon is 2030. When conducting the scenario analyses, we reviewed several parameters to determine our resil­ ience, both for RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. For both scenarios we reviewed the potential impact on our supply chain, our own operations and our market and our customers; as well as assets and business activities. The focus areas were based on material financial risk and opportunity across the value chain. This included assessing countries where we operate, source from and markets where we are present. For example, by 2030 for our factories we assessed locations that are potentially exposed to acute risk such as flooding, sea-level rise and exposure to cyclones in regions that are at and close to sea-level; as well as locations that are exposed to chronic risk such as prolonged extreme heat and drought in countries such as United Arab Emirates and India. To perform the analysis, we assembled a cross-func­ tional internal team with deep knowledge and global sector expertise for their function, to represent the stakeholders in our value chain. Based on their knowl­ edge and expertise, we determined what the financial risk or opportunity was likely to be for the assessed categories of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks. Our strategy and business model, coupled with our focus to in­ crease our sustainability maturity in our supply chain, our own operations and innovation, through our sustainability target commitments and objectives, will ensure our company is resilient to the potential risks presented by both RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. There are no obvious uncertainties resulting from our analysis. For both scenarios, there is potential physical risk in our supply chain and own operations. Our operations have very limited exposure to acute and chronic risks, while our agile supply chain and innovation strategy will enable us to adapt to and/or mitigate risks as well as realize opportunities. We have implemented a process for upgrading facilities with lower energy efficiency to reach a higher energy efficiency and reduce our emissions in the coming five years. We will review the potential for trainings and ongoing learning opportunities for our personnel to make sure that our workforce remains resilient for future climate change challenges. The output and results from the scenario analysis RCP 6 and RCP 2.6 are presented graphically in the TCFD table on page 78. ASSA ABLOY has not identified which assets and business activities are incompatible with or need significant efforts to be compatible with transition to climate-neutral economy.

"81 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Environmental information During 2024, we conducted several reviews of the established and emerging legislation of the EU Taxon­ omy classification system. In the Taxonomy Report Technical Annex 1, under Climate Change Mitigation, we interpret our relevance in section 3.5, Manufac­ ture of energy efficiency equipment for buildings; relating to doors with U-value lower or equal to 1.2 (W/m2K). We deem our sales from doors, where insu­ lation is relevant, to be Taxonomy eligible. In 2024, we measured the percentage of our eligible revenue. It is important to note a thermal efficiency U-value of 1.2 W/m2K is not achievable for all types of doors. For example, industry best in class revolving doors have a U-value of around 4 W/m2K. Despite having a U-value higher than 1.2 W/m2K, this does not mean a revolving door is not a more sustainable solution for a building compared to another door type. It is more important to have the right door for the right applica­ tion. Taking the application and how people interact with a door into consideration has a much bigger overall environmental impact, than just measuring the thermal efficiency of a door in isolation. Due to uncertainties and limitations required of achieving the criteria required for Taxonomy alignment, it will be challenging to align our economic activities (Turnover, CapEx, OpEx) with the criteria established in Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/2139. We will prioritize our focus and resources to realizing Definitions: 1 The Taxonomy Turnover equals the Group's revenue, which mainly consists of product sales. Service related to products sold represents a limited share of revenue. Revenue for the sale of the Group’s products is recognized at a given point in time when the customer gains control over the product, usually at the time of delivery. ASSA ABLOY also carries out installation services, which are recognized over time. Refer also to note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. 2 The Taxonomy Capital Expenditures (CapEx) is determined on the basis of investments and acquisitions of leased assets, tangible assets and intangible assets excluding good- will, that are included in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2024. Refer also to notes 14, 15 and 16 of the consolidated financial statements. 3 The Taxonomy Operational Expenditures (OpEx) are calculated on the basis of non-capitalized research and development costs, costs for building renovation measures, costs for repairs and maintenance of plant, machinery, equipment as well as expenses that are attributable to short-term leases (<12 months) and not recognized as right-of-use assets in the balance sheet as of 31 December 2024. EU Taxonomy our science-based targets, which will have a material impact on our total greenhouse gas emissions. Due to the updated requirements in the EU Taxon­ omy, we do not meet the criteria required to disclose aligned percentage. The change of requirements in Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) Appendix C is ambiguous; we will require more guidance from the EU to ascertain how we can apply and interpret these new requirements. We have reviewed the technical screening criteria for the four remaining EU Taxonomy objectives. We did not identify ASSA ABLOY economic activities in the screening criteria. CapEx decreased in magnitude between 2023 and 2024 due to capitaliza­ tion of acquisitions in 2023, while turnover and OpEx remain at the same level as in 2023. The EU Taxonomy is an evolving legislation, and we will continue to monitor its development and prepare to disclose in alignment with the Taxonomy accordingly. 2024 EU Taxonomy KPI results Total (SEK M) Eligible % Non-eligible % Turnover1 150,162 18% 82% CapEx2 8,236 10% 90% OpEx3 7,267 2% 98% Nuclear energy and fossil gas related activities Nuclear energy related activitiex 2024 1.

Our MFP program consolidates sites to eliminate unnecessary duplication and maximizes our operational efficiency. Industrial CO2 elimination In the past, a limited number of sites used freon as a blowing agent in the door insulation process. Freon is a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions. By eliminating the use of Freon in our operations, we have dramatically reduced our Scope 1 emissions. Strategic sites energy overhaul ASSA ABLOY operates over 1,000 sites in 70 countries. The top 25 most energy-­ intensive sites account for more than 60 percent of Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Our workstream focuses on improving energy effectiveness and efficiency to significantly reduce the energy consumption of these sites. Continuous improvement In our revised Operational Excellence strategy, sustainability is one of the four key pillars. Sustainability is a key part of our global operational excellence maturity assessment, ensuring a focus on sustainability, and energy reduction is an organic part of how we operate every day. This results in hundreds of little ideas for improvement, which add up to a big impact. 1 3 2 4 Visualizing our Scope 1 & 2 emissions reduction pathway We use a standardized approach to identify and visualize the key levers required to enable the Group to achieve its 50 percent Scope 1 & 2 reduction target to 2030. The four-pronged strategic approach is replicated in all divisions, all business units and at the factory level. This standardized approach is applied throughout the Group and tracked on a quarterly basis, ensuring we are on track to achieving our climate targets. The investments needed to realize this plan are related to lever three and four. We do not have a separate investment vehicle to realize the plan, all investments are made through our capital expenditure process and follow the same rules as all other capital investments. Due to difference in the definition of CapEx and OpEx between EU Taxonomy and our financial statements, and the fact all capital invest­ ments must follow the same rules, our financial statement CapEx and OpEx does not tally with investments in carbon improvements. –50% Due diligence Cease, prevent or mitigate ASSA ABLOY has made a long-term commitment to address climate change by setting both near-term and net-zero science-based targets consistent with the Science Based Targets initiative. Our targets are aligned to a 1.5°C trajectory, the most ambitious aims of the Paris Agreement. We are fully committed to delivering on our am­ bitious science-based targets, to halve our absolute Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions and reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 28 percent by 2030, as well as achieving net-zero no later than 2050. Our four- pronged strategic approach to Scope 1 & 2 emissions is delivering positive results. We have reduced our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 36 percent, against our 2019 baseline. We have reduced our Scope 3 emis­ sions by 10 percent, against our 2019 baseline. Our Scope 3 emissions make up the vast majority of our total emissions and represent the carbon footprint of our wider value chain. Our Scope 3 target is challenging. To address this, we have assembled cross-functional science-based targets teams who are dedicated to driving the most important activities in our Scope 3 action plan to deliver on our targets. We have set up a science-based targets governance structure, which includes our Chief Financial Officer, to ensure we are on the right path to achieving our goals. Our environmental sustainability policy is aligned with our climate commitment. There are potential locked-in greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations in the form of our operations infrastructure such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, space heating equipment, compressors, transformers, heating and electrical process equipment.

We engage in value analysis/value engineering in product development to increase material effectiveness, choose low-car­ bon materials for our new products as much as possible, and prioritize the use of low-carbon transport and logistics. Together, these help us to develop energy-efficient products and solutions with a lower carbon footprint throughout their lifecycle compared with their predecessors. to its end of life, we will work to upgrade with low- carbon and increased energy efficiency alternatives to mitigate future locked-in emissions. We calculated our greenhouse gas inventory across our entire value chain for the first time, including our Scope 3 footprint, in 2022. Our Scope 3 footprint makes up 96 percent of our total footprint. More than 70 percent of our Scope 3 footprint is upstream in our supply chain, coming from purchased goods and materials. Some of our largest purchasing categories, which include steel, electronics, aluminum, brass, zinc and other metals and materials, are traditionally carbon intensive. This year we have made a significant change to our calculation methodology, moving from spend-based to a mix of spend-based method and average-data method, predominantly item weight data, but also material information. We have also expanded the list of possible materials from 20 to 190. Materials used more seldom may only appear once in this list, but for common materials like steel, we have many different types of steel, many different geographies for the origin of the material, all with individual emission fac­ tors. Further, the emission factors have been revised. In general, the methodology is that we use item quantity multiplied with item weight multiplied with the emission factor for the material in scope. If either the item weight and/or the material is unknown, we have methods to estimate these. Weight is estimated using a median value for the weight of other items within the same item category and the material is estimated by applying a default material, which we have done for all our category codes. These default materials are the most conservative option, meaning the one with the highest emission factor of the rele­ vant options, available, in order not to underestimate. For the spend-based component, that we still use if we don’t know the item weight, we have a much larg­ er sample size, causing the conversion factors to be far more accurate than in the past. All these changes combined have led to significantly lower numbers than we have presented before.

We work systematically with our supply chain partners to identify and implement effective initiatives to reduce our Scope 3 footprint, such as sourcing materials with higher recycled content or low-carbon alternatives. In addition, we support them to reduce their Scope 1 & 2 emissions, which has a knock-on benefit for our Scope 3 footprint. Sustainable Innovation All new products and solutions are developed using our Sustainability Compass, which ensures sustainability is embedded into all new products launched. We have developed a sustainability portfolio planning tool, which enables our pro­ duct management teams to have a targeted approach to driving improvements on the most carbon intensive product portfolios couple with the highest sales volumes. Value Analysis / Value Engineering Value analysis / value engineering is a mature continuous improvement process that enables us to design waste out of our product and manufacturing processes. We leverage this process to do more with less, reducing waste and lowering our products’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint.

We prioritize low-carbon transport methods such as sea, rail and road. 1 3 2 4"
"87 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors emphasizing that almost the entire reduction is due to a change in methodology and not actual reduc­ tions. Further, it is important to understand that the methodology is, despite being far more accurate than previously, still based on assumptions and simplifi­ cations in certain places and the emissions may still go up or down when even more accurate data will be available. Another important aspect to raise is the fact that even if we base the emission calculation on actual item weight or actual material information, this information is often not verified and could theo­ retically be incorrect. We believe our suppliers have a thorough understanding and correct data regarding the items they sell to us. Although we use a science-based and data driven approach, there is a degree of uncertainty where estimates are utilized. This presents a risk to the ac­ curacy of our Scope 3 footprint. We are continuously working to improve our data accuracy across our Scope 3 categories, while benchmarking with other complex organizations. We will also stay abreast of the development of the new GHG Protocol Scope 3 carbon accounting standard, which is due for release in 2026, to ensure our methodology is aligned. ASSA ABLOY has included 100 percent of subsidi­ aries' emissions under operational or financial in the target boundary, as required per the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard; which has been verified and ratified by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY does not have any significant joint ventures. Our Scope 3 data has been restated to include ac­ quisitions, where the data is available. Our Scope 1 & 2 data will be restated to include acquisitions during 2025. We anticipate the inclusion of Hardware and Home Improvement (HHI) will have a material impact on our baseline across all three emission scopes, when the data becomes available for us to restate. We do not anticipate significant risk or impact from acquisitions made in 2024. Our Scope 1 emissions are generated from energy burned on site in our operations such as oil and gas, CO2eq from industrial processes and fleet emissions. Reported normalized KPIs are based on cur­ rency-neutral monetary values and value added rather than sales – to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations and the ongoing restructuring of the Group. As a result, value added for intensity met­ rics is restated each year. By using value added as a measure, the normalized values are also not affected by the outsourcing of manufacturing. We believe this provides a more accurate picture of what is going on in the Group. Electricity emission factors are based on data on electricity production for 2010, as published by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2012). These emission factors are used for calculation of emissions until end of 2016. In 2017 and again in 2024 ASSA ABLOY updated the emission factors used to calculate greenhouse gases from electricity consumption. The emission factors are based on the most recent data published by the IEA and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are expressed in CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq). Our transition plan to realize our long-term climate commitment is approved by the Board of Directors, our highest governing body with overall responsibility for sustainability. Sustainability is part of everything we do and is or­ ganically integrated into our overall business strategy; the transition plan is aligned to our business strategy and financial plans. The progress towards our transi­ tion plan can be seen in our carbon data table E1-6 gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions on page 89. We have excluded Scope 3 categories that are not relevant to our organization; for example, upstream/ downstream leased assets, as well as excluding categories which represent less than 0.2 percent of Scope 3, for example, capital goods, as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY is not taking any other actions besides that to mitigate negative effects on the environment and/or affected communities. We are working towards using primary data from suppliers, though to date we do not utilize primary data. We do not have a carbon pricing scheme at ASSA ABLOY. We do not have carbon removal projects in place and do not utilize carbon credits or offsets. There are no changes in target and corresponding metrics or underlying measurement methodologies, significant assumptions, limitations, sources and adopted pro­ cesses to collect data."

Our MFP program consolidates sites to eliminate unnecessary duplication and maximizes our operational efficiency. Industrial CO2 elimination In the past, a limited number of sites used freon as a blowing agent in the door insulation process. Freon is a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions. By eliminating the use of Freon in our operations, we have dramatically reduced our Scope 1 emissions. Strategic sites energy overhaul ASSA ABLOY operates over 1,000 sites in 70 countries. The top 25 most energy-­ intensive sites account for more than 60 percent of Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Our workstream focuses on improving energy effectiveness and efficiency to significantly reduce the energy consumption of these sites. Continuous improvement In our revised Operational Excellence strategy, sustainability is one of the four key pillars. Sustainability is a key part of our global operational excellence maturity assessment, ensuring a focus on sustainability, and energy reduction is an organic part of how we operate every day. This results in hundreds of little ideas for improvement, which add up to a big impact. 1 3 2 4 Visualizing our Scope 1 & 2 emissions reduction pathway We use a standardized approach to identify and visualize the key levers required to enable the Group to achieve its 50 percent Scope 1 & 2 reduction target to 2030. The four-pronged strategic approach is replicated in all divisions, all business units and at the factory level. This standardized approach is applied throughout the Group and tracked on a quarterly basis, ensuring we are on track to achieving our climate targets. The investments needed to realize this plan are related to lever three and four. We do not have a separate investment vehicle to realize the plan, all investments are made through our capital expenditure process and follow the same rules as all other capital investments. Due to difference in the definition of CapEx and OpEx between EU Taxonomy and our financial statements, and the fact all capital invest­ ments must follow the same rules, our financial statement CapEx and OpEx does not tally with investments in carbon improvements. –50% Due diligence Cease, prevent or mitigate ASSA ABLOY has made a long-term commitment to address climate change by setting both near-term and net-zero science-based targets consistent with the Science Based Targets initiative. Our targets are aligned to a 1.5°C trajectory, the most ambitious aims of the Paris Agreement. We are fully committed to delivering on our am­ bitious science-based targets, to halve our absolute Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions and reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 28 percent by 2030, as well as achieving net-zero no later than 2050. Our four- pronged strategic approach to Scope 1 & 2 emissions is delivering positive results. We have reduced our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 36 percent, against our 2019 baseline. We have reduced our Scope 3 emis­ sions by 10 percent, against our 2019 baseline. Our Scope 3 emissions make up the vast majority of our total emissions and represent the carbon footprint of our wider value chain. Our Scope 3 target is challenging. To address this, we have assembled cross-functional science-based targets teams who are dedicated to driving the most important activities in our Scope 3 action plan to deliver on our targets. We have set up a science-based targets governance structure, which includes our Chief Financial Officer, to ensure we are on the right path to achieving our goals. Our environmental sustainability policy is aligned with our climate commitment. There are potential locked-in greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations in the form of our operations infrastructure such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, space heating equipment, compressors, transformers, heating and electrical process equipment.

"86 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors High level approach to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 28% by 2030 During 2024, we identified key levers to reduce emissions and help meet our Scope 3 target. We engage in value analysis/value engineering in product development to increase material effectiveness, choose low-car­ bon materials for our new products as much as possible, and prioritize the use of low-carbon transport and logistics. Together, these help us to develop energy-efficient products and solutions with a lower carbon footprint throughout their lifecycle compared with their predecessors. to its end of life, we will work to upgrade with low- carbon and increased energy efficiency alternatives to mitigate future locked-in emissions. We calculated our greenhouse gas inventory across our entire value chain for the first time, including our Scope 3 footprint, in 2022. Our Scope 3 footprint makes up 96 percent of our total footprint. More than 70 percent of our Scope 3 footprint is upstream in our supply chain, coming from purchased goods and materials. Some of our largest purchasing categories, which include steel, electronics, aluminum, brass, zinc and other metals and materials, are traditionally carbon intensive. This year we have made a significant change to our calculation methodology, moving from spend-based to a mix of spend-based method and average-data method, predominantly item weight data, but also material information. We have also expanded the list of possible materials from 20 to 190. Materials used more seldom may only appear once in this list, but for common materials like steel, we have many different types of steel, many different geographies for the origin of the material, all with individual emission fac­ tors. Further, the emission factors have been revised. In general, the methodology is that we use item quantity multiplied with item weight multiplied with the emission factor for the material in scope. If either the item weight and/or the material is unknown, we have methods to estimate these. Weight is estimated using a median value for the weight of other items within the same item category and the material is estimated by applying a default material, which we have done for all our category codes. These default materials are the most conservative option, meaning the one with the highest emission factor of the rele­ vant options, available, in order not to underestimate. For the spend-based component, that we still use if we don’t know the item weight, we have a much larg­ er sample size, causing the conversion factors to be far more accurate than in the past. All these changes combined have led to significantly lower numbers than we have presented before.

We work systematically with our supply chain partners to identify and implement effective initiatives to reduce our Scope 3 footprint, such as sourcing materials with higher recycled content or low-carbon alternatives. In addition, we support them to reduce their Scope 1 & 2 emissions, which has a knock-on benefit for our Scope 3 footprint. Sustainable Innovation All new products and solutions are developed using our Sustainability Compass, which ensures sustainability is embedded into all new products launched. We have developed a sustainability portfolio planning tool, which enables our pro­ duct management teams to have a targeted approach to driving improvements on the most carbon intensive product portfolios couple with the highest sales volumes. Value Analysis / Value Engineering Value analysis / value engineering is a mature continuous improvement process that enables us to design waste out of our product and manufacturing processes. We leverage this process to do more with less, reducing waste and lowering our products’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint. Logistics We work with our logistics partners to optimize both inbound and outbound transport, enabling us to service our customers in a faster way while reducing our Scope 3 footprint. We prioritize low-carbon transport methods such as sea, rail and road. 1 3 2 4"
"87 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors emphasizing that almost the entire reduction is due to a change in methodology and not actual reduc­ tions. Further, it is important to understand that the methodology is, despite being far more accurate than previously, still based on assumptions and simplifi­ cations in certain places and the emissions may still go up or down when even more accurate data will be available. Another important aspect to raise is the fact that even if we base the emission calculation on actual item weight or actual material information, this information is often not verified and could theo­ retically be incorrect. We believe our suppliers have a thorough understanding and correct data regarding the items they sell to us. Although we use a science-based and data driven approach, there is a degree of uncertainty where estimates are utilized. This presents a risk to the ac­ curacy of our Scope 3 footprint. We are continuously working to improve our data accuracy across our Scope 3 categories, while benchmarking with other complex organizations. We will also stay abreast of the development of the new GHG Protocol Scope 3 carbon accounting standard, which is due for release in 2026, to ensure our methodology is aligned. ASSA ABLOY has included 100 percent of subsidi­ aries' emissions under operational or financial in the target boundary, as required per the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard; which has been verified and ratified by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY does not have any significant joint ventures. Our Scope 3 data has been restated to include ac­ quisitions, where the data is available. Our Scope 1 & 2 data will be restated to include acquisitions during 2025. We anticipate the inclusion of Hardware and Home Improvement (HHI) will have a material impact on our baseline across all three emission scopes, when the data becomes available for us to restate. We do not anticipate significant risk or impact from acquisitions made in 2024. Our Scope 1 emissions are generated from energy burned on site in our operations such as oil and gas, CO2eq from industrial processes and fleet emissions. Reported normalized KPIs are based on cur­ rency-neutral monetary values and value added rather than sales – to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations and the ongoing restructuring of the Group. As a result, value added for intensity met­ rics is restated each year. By using value added as a measure, the normalized values are also not affected by the outsourcing of manufacturing. We believe this provides a more accurate picture of what is going on in the Group. Electricity emission factors are based on data on electricity production for 2010, as published by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2012). These emission factors are used for calculation of emissions until end of 2016. In 2017 and again in 2024 ASSA ABLOY updated the emission factors used to calculate greenhouse gases from electricity consumption. The emission factors are based on the most recent data published by the IEA and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are expressed in CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq). Our transition plan to realize our long-term climate commitment is approved by the Board of Directors, our highest governing body with overall responsibility for sustainability. Sustainability is part of everything we do and is or­ ganically integrated into our overall business strategy; the transition plan is aligned to our business strategy and financial plans. The progress towards our transi­ tion plan can be seen in our carbon data table E1-6 gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions on page 89. We have excluded Scope 3 categories that are not relevant to our organization; for example, upstream/ downstream leased assets, as well as excluding categories which represent less than 0.2 percent of Scope 3, for example, capital goods, as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY is not taking any other actions besides that to mitigate negative effects on the environment and/or affected communities. We are working towards using primary data from suppliers, though to date we do not utilize primary data. We do not have a carbon pricing scheme at ASSA ABLOY. We do not have carbon removal projects in place and do not utilize carbon credits or offsets. There are no changes in target and corresponding metrics or underlying measurement methodologies, significant assumptions, limitations, sources and adopted pro­ cesses to collect data."

Sustainability is an integrated part of the report submitted to the Audit Committee ahead of each quarterly Audit Committee meeting. The Chair­ person of the Audit Committee reports from each Audit Committee meeting to the Board of Directors at every subsequent Board meeting. Sustainability matters including material impacts, risks and oppor­ tunities, implementation of due diligence, and results and effectiveness of policies, actions, metrics and targets adopted to address them, and sustainability disclosures are addressed by the Board of Directors as needed and at least annually. Within the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee the members are professionals with long experience from different senior positions, including CEO and other senior management positions, in global industrial companies and as such they have extensive experience from managing the topics generally cov­ ered by the sustainability concept, including business conduct. The Board of Directors is supported by rele­ vant functions within the Group, such as the Group’s Head of Sustainability, on sustainability issues. Our sustainability issues are managed in a sys­ our logistics footprint, prioritizing low-carbon trans­ port options. Our diverse customer base is served through multiple routes to market, including distrib­ utors and direct sales. Our products are designed to ensure the safety and security of our customers and their assets, with sustainability embedded through energy efficiency, low-carbon materials, extended product life, and recyclability at the end of life. Our sustainability targets are designed to support the long-term strategic goals of the company, ensur­ ing alignment with our vision to help people feel safe, secure, and experience a more open world. As well as create value for stakeholders while addressing global sustainability challenges. These targets focus on areas where our operations, products, and value chain have the most significant impacts and opportunities. The following sustainability-related targets have been established. Our science-based targets are our cli­ mate action goals where our near-term target Reduce Scope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 50 percent, and reduce Scope 3 emissions by 28 percent by 2030, against our 2019 baseline. Our long-term target is to realize net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050, which is to reduce all scopes by 90 percent. This supports our transition to a low-carbon economy and aligns with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This also supports our stra­ tegic objective of cost-efficiency in everything we do. Our focus on resource efficiency includes reducing energy, water, non-hazardous waste and hazardous waste intensity by 25 percent by 2025. Reduce organ­ ic solvents intensity by 50 percent by 2025. Achieve 100 percent ISO 14001 certification for relevant manufacturing sites by 2025. This supports waste reduction and optimization of resource use, as well as supporting our strategic objective of cost-efficiency in everything we do. Diversity and inclusion are an im­ portant part of our sustainability targets. To increase the representation of women in leadership roles to 30 percent by 2025. This helps to advance social equity and reflects our commitment to creating an inclusive workplace. Our targets are informed by stakeholder engage­ ment, double materiality assessments, and industry benchmarks. Our climate action targets are ratified by the Science Based Targets initiative. Our social targets are benchmarked against leading practic­ tematic and consistent way, at divisional level. Each division is responsible for managing our sustaina­ bility agenda, identifying and addressing risks and opportunities in the context of their business, as well as governing the Code of Conduct and related policies. Managers for environmental sustainability, supply, and innovation at the Group and divisional levels ensure that the necessary policies, processes and tools for managing environmental issues exist and are implemented. The Human Resources (HR) functions at the Group and divisional levels have the corresponding responsibility for managing social and ethical matters. Every factory or business unit has the operational responsibility within each division. Each division is also responsible for ensuring that current and new suppliers understand and comply with our requirements. To drive the agenda, five functional sustainability councils have been defined. The Group intranet includes two sections that focus on sustainability; one offering general information for all employees, while the other supports sustainability managers and includes tools, best practices, and access to the sustainability reporting database. ASSA ABLOY operates a complex supply chain, sourcing raw materials, components, and finished goods. This supply chain significantly impacts our value chain, particularly in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and resource consumption. As with all supply chains, there are risks related to fair labor prac­ tices, which we work to systematically mitigate by requiring all suppliers to sign and adhere to our Code of Conduct for Business Partners and conducting sup­ plier sustainability audits. Positive opportunities arise from collaboration and innovation, aiming to reduce sustainability impacts through the use of low-carbon materials and improved resource efficiency. In our operations and manufacturing sites, the health and safety of our employees is our number one priority. We ensure fair treatment and equal opportunities for all employees. We work to reduce our carbon footprint, waste generation, and the use of water and potentially hazardous materials. Our governance structure and Group sustainability goals and targets provide a clear framework to help us minimize our impact. We collaborate with logistics partners to optimize es in our sector and are aligned to international standards such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Progress is tracked quarterly using key performance indicators and reported annually in our CSRD sustainability statement. Our cross-divisional sustainability council reviews progress and ensures alignment with overall business objectives. Example KPIs include annual GHG emissions (metric tons CO2eq), percentage of recycled materials used, and gender diversity metrics. All metrics are disclosed in our sustainability statement. As per our governance structure responsibility for achieving targets lies with the CEO and Board of Directors. We are unable to present revenue per ESRS sector due to disaggregation of the Groups revenue however as seen in Note 2, revenue broken down by geography/product group. As we continue to improve our visibility of sustainability impacts on a financial level, we will review the possibility to implement ESRS mapping to revenue where practicable. ASSA ABLOY has not assessed the financial impacts of material risks and opportunities on financial position, financial performance and cash flows and material risks and opportunities; for which there is significant risk of material adjustment within the next annual reporting period to carrying amounts of assets and liabilities reported in related financial statements due to limitation of data. Consumers and end-users of ASSA ABLOY are included in reporting of S4. ASSA ABLOY does not have a full set of internal controls in place for ESRS reporting, this will be developed during 2025. Executive remuneration Climate and other sustainability-related targets are factored into the variable remuneration of all mem­ bers of the Executive Team reporting to the CEO, as well as management teams throughout the divisions. These targets are usually linked with decreasing our energy consumption, which is a key driver for our Scope 1 & 2 emissions; the reduction targets are aligned to our annual emissions reduction as part of our science-based targets. This and other sustainabil­ ity-related targets, such as health and safety and peo­ ple strategy, are typically in the form of short-term variable remuneration and usually 3 to 5 percent of the total short-term variable remuneration target."
"68 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors ASSA ABLOY has adopted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The OECD requirement to “embed respon­ sible business conduct into policies and management systems” is described in the governance and policy matrix. The requirement to “identify and assess adverse impacts in operations, supply chains and business relationships” is described in the double materiality analysis. The requirements to “cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts” and to “track implementation and results” are covered in the environmental and social sections. This publication forms part of how we meet the requirement to “communicate how impacts are addressed.” Due diligence process and supporting measures Identify & assess adverse impacts In operations, supply chains and business relationships Communicate How impacts are addressed Track Implementation and results Cease, prevent or mitigate Adverse impacts Embed responsible business conduct Into policies & management systems Provide for or cooperate In remediation when appropriate In preparation for the CSRD, we carried out a double materiality assessment during 2023 and 2024. In the past, we have conducted single materiality assess­ ments in the form of an impact materiality assess­ ment, which provides an inside-out perspective to assess ASSA ABLOY’s impact on the world. An impact materiality assessment forms one part of the double materiality assessment. The second part is a financial materiality assessment. This provides an outside-in perspective to assess the financial implica­ tions that potential material topics may have on the Group. We have reported according to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2021, which acts as a solid foundation when prepar­ ing our financial materiality assessment. Double materiality assessment process The following key activities take place during the double materiality assessment process, all of which help to inform the analysis. • Stakeholder survey • Workshop 1: Impact materiality • Workshop 2: Financial materiality • Analysis of survey, workshops and written documents • Workshop 3: Validation of draft list of material matters Impact materiality factors Severity factors and likelihood are graded as follows: • Scale: Large or small (how grave the negative impact is or how beneficial the positive impact is) • Scope: Large or small (how widespread the impact is, for example geographical extent, number of people) • Irremediability: High or low (to what extent a negative impact could be remediated) • Likelihood: High or low (for potential impact or actual impact) Impact materiality threshold A sustainability matter is determined as material when: • There is an actual impact or a potential impact with a high likelihood • With a value of large/high for at least two out of three negative severity factors (scale, scope, irremediability), and/or • With a value of large for at least one out of the two positive factors (scale, scope) Other impacts are scrutinized individually to see if scale, scope or irremediable character alone makes a negative impact severe enough to qualify as material. Financial materiality factors The likelihood and potential magnitude of financial effects are graded as follows: • Likelihood: High or low • Magnitude: Large or small Financial materiality threshold A sustainability matter is determined as material when: • It has a value of high likelihood and large magni­ tude in terms of either being a risk or an opportu­ nity, or both For financially-material matters, the material sub- topics match the sub-topics that are material from an impact perspective.

"69 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Double materiality assessment outcome Following our double materiality assessment process we have identified the following ESRS topics as being materially relevant: E1 Climate Change, E3 Water and Marine Resources, E5 Resource Use and Circular Economy, S1 Own Workforce, S2 Workers in the Value Chain, S4 Consumers and End-users, G1 Business Conduct. The identified material topics are closely aligned to our overall business strategy, where sustainability is integrated into everything we do. We identified the following topics as not being materially relevant from a CSRD perspective: E2 Pollution, E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems, S3 Affected Communities. Our stakeholders did not identify the topics as materially relevant to ASSA ABLOY operations and our value chain. Although the topics were not identified as materially relevant in our assessment, they are still important to ASSA ABLOY, and we take the necessary steps to mitigate the risk of pollution or biodiversity loss and we support affected communities where we operate locally and in our value chain.

"70 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Double materiality assessment methodology We followed the steps outlined by the ESRS to conduct our double materiality assessment: 1. Stakeholder engagement: We conducted stakeholder surveys with over 500 stakeholders to understand the concerns and priorities of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and NGOs. 2. Materiality workshops: We carried out work­ shops to discuss both impact materiality (the sig­ nificance of the social and environmental impact of the company) and financial materiality (the importance of sustainability issues to enterprise value). 3. Preliminary findings: We compiled the prelim­ inary results from the workshops and surveys to identify the sustainability matters that are materi­ al to the company. 4. Validation process: We established a verification team made up of function heads and subject mat­ ter experts to validate the preliminary findings, where feedback was collected and incorporated. 5. Reporting: Our sustainability statement and An­ nual Report have been prepared in alignment with the CSRD reporting metrics and requirements, ensuring that it includes the updated materiality analysis. 6. Continuous improvement: We will use the outcomes of the materiality assessment to continuously improve sustainability practices and reporting. Process steps – Impact materiality We followed the five process steps for impact materiality as defined by the CSRD: 1. Engagement of stakeholders: We engaged internal subject matter experts, representatives from each division and all functional heads across the Group to attend and provide input during the impact materiality workshop. We ran a series of education and awareness sessions before the impact materiality workshop with all internal stakeholders to bring them up to speed on what disclosing to CSRD would entail. We developed a standardized survey for our wider stakeholders and received over 500 responses from stakehold­ ers; including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and NGOs. The output from the stakeholders was aggregated into focus areas to ensure the stakeholder input from the surveys was taken into account during the impact materiality workshop. 2. Scoping of impacts: We reviewed our previous materiality assessments and sustainability focus areas as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant topics. This provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the CSRD. 3. Assessment of individual impacts: As outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each impact, considering factors such as scale, scope, irremediability and likelihood. 4. Calibration of material impacts: We used the in­ put from our stakeholder surveys, internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. This ensured that the identi­ fied material topics are relevant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. Stakeholder and management review: The findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our Executive Team and the Board of Directors. This step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects ASSA ABLOY’s sus­ tainability impacts and material issues. This result­ ed in the identification of fifteen negative impact material sub-topics. The findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and Group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or Group strategy. Our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to CSRD as well as progress towards our sustainabili­ ty goals and objectives. Process steps – Financial materiality We followed the five process steps for financial materiality as defined by the CSRD: 1. Engagement of stakeholders: We engaged internal subject matter experts, including risk management and all functional heads across the Group to attend and provide their input during the financial materiality workshop. 2. Scoping of impacts: We reviewed our previous disclosures to TCFD and scenario analyses as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant financial topics. This provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the CSRD. 3. Assessment of individual impacts: As outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each risk, considering factors such as likelihood and magnitude. 4. Calibration of material impacts: We used the input from our internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. This ensured the identified material topics are rel­ evant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. Stakeholder and management review: The findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our Executive Team and the Board of Directors. This step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects ASSA ABLOY ́s sustainability impacts and material issues. This resulted in the identification of twelve financial material sub-topics. The findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and Group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or Group strategy. Our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to all CSRD Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) as well as progress towards our sustainabil­ ity goals and objectives."

"78 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures In 2024, ASSA ABLOY continued to explore and understand the requirements of the TCFD. We are gradually developing the process of reporting to the TCFD, to ensure it is meaningful and helpful in guiding our organization to make informed decisions based on climate-related risk and opportunity. We are firmly convinced the TCFD framework will enable us to identify and navigate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. We carried out our third climate scenario analysis during the year. The analysis reviewed the risks and opportunities of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks, to 2030 and 2050. The two different climate scenarios we reviewed were developed by the UN International Panel on Climate Control (IPCC): RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. The two scenario analyses were used to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities over the short and medium term to 2030, as well as the long- term to 2050. RCP 2.6, called Realizing the Paris Agreement, is a scenario where emissions decline rapidly over the coming decades, resulting in a temperature increase up to 2.3°C warmer by the end of the century. RCP 6, called The Rocky Road, is a scenario where emissions are declining at an insufficient rate and not to the level required, resulting in a temperature in­ crease up to 3.7°C warmer by the end of the century. Scenario analysis During the scenario analysis we added more context, where we tried to understand both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, especially for climate-relat­ ed risk. We developed the process to be able to quan­ tify our climate-related risk, in terms of percentage of sales from low risk to very high risk. Depending on the level of risk (from low to very high), the financial risk is then determined as percentage impact on total annu­ al sales. The analysis reviewed risks and opportunities relating to two different climate scenarios and how they could impact ASSA ABLOY’s business in 2030 and 2050. The outcomes are summarized in the blocks to the right.

"79 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 For the climate scenarios we have applied two time horizons (2030) and (2050) which is in line with the Paris Agreement. However, for greenhouse gas reduc­ tion targets the time horizon is 2030. When conducting the scenario analyses, we reviewed several parameters to determine our resil­ ience, both for RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. For both scenarios we reviewed the potential impact on our supply chain, our own operations and our market and our customers; as well as assets and business activities. The focus areas were based on material financial risk and opportunity across the value chain. This included assessing countries where we operate, source from and markets where we are present. For example, by 2030 for our factories we assessed locations that are potentially exposed to acute risk such as flooding, sea-level rise and exposure to cyclones in regions that are at and close to sea-level; as well as locations that are exposed to chronic risk such as prolonged extreme heat and drought in countries such as United Arab Emirates and India. To perform the analysis, we assembled a cross-func­ tional internal team with deep knowledge and global sector expertise for their function, to represent the stakeholders in our value chain. Based on their knowl­ edge and expertise, we determined what the financial risk or opportunity was likely to be for the assessed categories of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks. Our strategy and business model, coupled with our focus to in­ crease our sustainability maturity in our supply chain, our own operations and innovation, through our sustainability target commitments and objectives, will ensure our company is resilient to the potential risks presented by both RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. There are no obvious uncertainties resulting from our analysis. For both scenarios, there is potential physical risk in our supply chain and own operations. Our operations have very limited exposure to acute and chronic risks, while our agile supply chain and innovation strategy will enable us to adapt to and/or mitigate risks as well as realize opportunities. We have implemented a process for upgrading facilities with lower energy efficiency to reach a higher energy efficiency and reduce our emissions in the coming five years. We will review the potential for trainings and ongoing learning opportunities for our personnel to make sure that our workforce remains resilient for future climate change challenges. The output and results from the scenario analysis RCP 6 and RCP 2.6 are presented graphically in the TCFD table on page 78. ASSA ABLOY has not identified which assets and business activities are incompatible with or need significant efforts to be compatible with transition to climate-neutral economy.

"86 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors High level approach to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 28% by 2030 During 2024, we identified key levers to reduce emissions and help meet our Scope 3 target. We engage in value analysis/value engineering in product development to increase material effectiveness, choose low-car­ bon materials for our new products as much as possible, and prioritize the use of low-carbon transport and logistics. Together, these help us to develop energy-efficient products and solutions with a lower carbon footprint throughout their lifecycle compared with their predecessors. to its end of life, we will work to upgrade with low- carbon and increased energy efficiency alternatives to mitigate future locked-in emissions. We calculated our greenhouse gas inventory across our entire value chain for the first time, including our Scope 3 footprint, in 2022. Our Scope 3 footprint makes up 96 percent of our total footprint. More than 70 percent of our Scope 3 footprint is upstream in our supply chain, coming from purchased goods and materials. Some of our largest purchasing categories, which include steel, electronics, aluminum, brass, zinc and other metals and materials, are traditionally carbon intensive. This year we have made a significant change to our calculation methodology, moving from spend-based to a mix of spend-based method and average-data method, predominantly item weight data, but also material information. We have also expanded the list of possible materials from 20 to 190. Materials used more seldom may only appear once in this list, but for common materials like steel, we have many different types of steel, many different geographies for the origin of the material, all with individual emission fac­ tors. Further, the emission factors have been revised. In general, the methodology is that we use item quantity multiplied with item weight multiplied with the emission factor for the material in scope. If either the item weight and/or the material is unknown, we have methods to estimate these. Weight is estimated using a median value for the weight of other items within the same item category and the material is estimated by applying a default material, which we have done for all our category codes. These default materials are the most conservative option, meaning the one with the highest emission factor of the rele­ vant options, available, in order not to underestimate. For the spend-based component, that we still use if we don’t know the item weight, we have a much larg­ er sample size, causing the conversion factors to be far more accurate than in the past. All these changes combined have led to significantly lower numbers than we have presented before.

We work systematically with our supply chain partners to identify and implement effective initiatives to reduce our Scope 3 footprint, such as sourcing materials with higher recycled content or low-carbon alternatives. In addition, we support them to reduce their Scope 1 & 2 emissions, which has a knock-on benefit for our Scope 3 footprint. Sustainable Innovation All new products and solutions are developed using our Sustainability Compass, which ensures sustainability is embedded into all new products launched. We have developed a sustainability portfolio planning tool, which enables our pro­ duct management teams to have a targeted approach to driving improvements on the most carbon intensive product portfolios couple with the highest sales volumes. Value Analysis / Value Engineering Value analysis / value engineering is a mature continuous improvement process that enables us to design waste out of our product and manufacturing processes. We leverage this process to do more with less, reducing waste and lowering our products’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint. Logistics We work with our logistics partners to optimize both inbound and outbound transport, enabling us to service our customers in a faster way while reducing our Scope 3 footprint. We prioritize low-carbon transport methods such as sea, rail and road. 1 3 2 4"
"87 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors emphasizing that almost the entire reduction is due to a change in methodology and not actual reduc­ tions. Further, it is important to understand that the methodology is, despite being far more accurate than previously, still based on assumptions and simplifi­ cations in certain places and the emissions may still go up or down when even more accurate data will be available. Another important aspect to raise is the fact that even if we base the emission calculation on actual item weight or actual material information, this information is often not verified and could theo­ retically be incorrect. We believe our suppliers have a thorough understanding and correct data regarding the items they sell to us. Although we use a science-based and data driven approach, there is a degree of uncertainty where estimates are utilized. This presents a risk to the ac­ curacy of our Scope 3 footprint. We are continuously working to improve our data accuracy across our Scope 3 categories, while benchmarking with other complex organizations. We will also stay abreast of the development of the new GHG Protocol Scope 3 carbon accounting standard, which is due for release in 2026, to ensure our methodology is aligned. ASSA ABLOY has included 100 percent of subsidi­ aries' emissions under operational or financial in the target boundary, as required per the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard; which has been verified and ratified by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY does not have any significant joint ventures. Our Scope 3 data has been restated to include ac­ quisitions, where the data is available. Our Scope 1 & 2 data will be restated to include acquisitions during 2025. We anticipate the inclusion of Hardware and Home Improvement (HHI) will have a material impact on our baseline across all three emission scopes, when the data becomes available for us to restate. We do not anticipate significant risk or impact from acquisitions made in 2024. Our Scope 1 emissions are generated from energy burned on site in our operations such as oil and gas, CO2eq from industrial processes and fleet emissions. Reported normalized KPIs are based on cur­ rency-neutral monetary values and value added rather than sales – to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations and the ongoing restructuring of the Group. As a result, value added for intensity met­ rics is restated each year. By using value added as a measure, the normalized values are also not affected by the outsourcing of manufacturing. We believe this provides a more accurate picture of what is going on in the Group. Electricity emission factors are based on data on electricity production for 2010, as published by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2012). These emission factors are used for calculation of emissions until end of 2016. In 2017 and again in 2024 ASSA ABLOY updated the emission factors used to calculate greenhouse gases from electricity consumption. The emission factors are based on the most recent data published by the IEA and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are expressed in CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq). Our transition plan to realize our long-term climate commitment is approved by the Board of Directors, our highest governing body with overall responsibility for sustainability. Sustainability is part of everything we do and is or­ ganically integrated into our overall business strategy; the transition plan is aligned to our business strategy and financial plans. The progress towards our transi­ tion plan can be seen in our carbon data table E1-6 gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions on page 89. We have excluded Scope 3 categories that are not relevant to our organization; for example, upstream/ downstream leased assets, as well as excluding categories which represent less than 0.2 percent of Scope 3, for example, capital goods, as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY is not taking any other actions besides that to mitigate negative effects on the environment and/or affected communities. We are working towards using primary data from suppliers, though to date we do not utilize primary data. We do not have a carbon pricing scheme at ASSA ABLOY. We do not have carbon removal projects in place and do not utilize carbon credits or offsets. There are no changes in target and corresponding metrics or underlying measurement methodologies, significant assumptions, limitations, sources and adopted pro­ cesses to collect data."

"90 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Due diligence Cease, prevent or mitigate Minimizing our environmental footprint in terms of water and marine resources, across our own opera­ tions and the entire value chain, is an integral part of ASSA ABLOY’s sustainability program. We identified water and marine resources as mate­ rial for ASSA ABLOY, considering impact materiality. We assessed this based on our own operations and our value chain. For our own operations we have a process to determine our dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. We do not have water-inten­ sive processes in areas with low water quality, which may jeopardize the quality of our products. We have a systematic process in place to mitigate the environ­ mental impact and water risk of our operations in high water-stress areas and downstream value chain. Use of water is seen as material regarding our own operations, but does not impact on oceans and seas. We take necessary steps to make sure the water we use and dispose to the municipalities from our opera­ tional processes such as painting, plating and cleaning is of the same quality level as water withdrawn it to mitigate any potential negative impact and risk to water bodies. The double materiality assessment outcomes, including water and marine resources, have been presented and consulted with our Board of Directors, stakeholders and other affected communities to engage them in the process and establish their views. Suggestions, opinions and comments regarding water and marine resources were taken into account in the final double materiality assessment. We continue to upgrade the infrastructure at our sites e.g. piping, additional meters to reduce leaks and implement monitoring systems at top water consuming sites, as well as introducing principles and processes to improve water efficiency. During 2024, water withdrawal decreased by two percent and water intensity by ten percent as a result of improve­ ment activities and infrastructure upgrades. Considering our own operations, the most water-intensive processes are the painting, plating and cleaning processes. There are 20 such entities, located mainly in the US, Europe and Asia, accounting for more than 60 percent of our total water consump­ tion. In factories with electroplating facilities, the water is used in the different process baths as well as for cleaning. In factories producing doors, the water is typically used for cleaning. An increasing portion of the water is recirculated and used again after purification. A wide range of purification methods are used across the Group, such as filtration, sedimenta­ tion, flocculation, ion exchange and reverse osmosis. The actions we take to improve our water efficiency and reduce consumption are applicable for each site which operates within the ASSA ABLOY Group in­ cluding entities located in areas at water risk. In 2024 the total amount of recycled water amounted to 19 percent of the total water consumption. An important part of our water management is to prevent water pollution across our sites. We are obliged to follow the local laws and the Group policy, to conduct regular audits and host third-party inspections. All entities across the Group are required to report known or potential site contamination map­ ping on an annual basis in our sustainability reporting system. The outcome of the report is being reviewed by a third party and relevant actions including remediations regarding historical contamination are being implemented and followed up. Site contami­ nation verification is also a part of our due diligence process in regard to new acquisitions. We ensure that any work with hazardous substances is organized to the highest standards, with wastewater being regularly disposed of and stored in designated areas, and secondary containment provided to contain and control potential spills. Risk mitigation in our own operations includes work to ensure that all factories with significant environmental impact and significant water-demanding processes are ISO 14001 certified. In the event that we do have a chemical spill, we have all the requisite equipment in place and spill kit to perform a cleanup immediately to remedy the incident. In the event the groundwater or local water body is contaminated, we will liaise with the relevant authorities to agree a remediation plan to remedy the contamination to the local legal level at a minimum. ASSA ABLOY’s long-term risk-management strategy covers sustainability aspects throughout our value chain, including water and marine resources. Within our supply chain, we carry out the same assessment as for our own operations. We review our suppliers’ production processes, taking into account environ­ mental dependencies, impacts, risks and opportuni­ ties. We ensure our suppliers have the same diligent controls as we do in our own operations. Our target is to reduce water consumption by 25 percent across all entities we operate in by the end of 2025, against our 2019 baseline year. Since we set up the target in 2020 there are no changes regarding measurement methodologies, significant assump­ tions, limitations, sources or adopted processes in data collection. The target is not mandatory based on legislation, but it is mandatory internally, which means all the divisions are required to contribute to realize the target. In 2024, against our baseline year 2019, we reduced our water intensity by 56 percent.

"68 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors ASSA ABLOY has adopted the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct. The OECD requirement to “embed respon­ sible business conduct into policies and management systems” is described in the governance and policy matrix. The requirement to “identify and assess adverse impacts in operations, supply chains and business relationships” is described in the double materiality analysis. The requirements to “cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts” and to “track implementation and results” are covered in the environmental and social sections. This publication forms part of how we meet the requirement to “communicate how impacts are addressed.” Due diligence process and supporting measures Identify & assess adverse impacts In operations, supply chains and business relationships Communicate How impacts are addressed Track Implementation and results Cease, prevent or mitigate Adverse impacts Embed responsible business conduct Into policies & management systems Provide for or cooperate In remediation when appropriate In preparation for the CSRD, we carried out a double materiality assessment during 2023 and 2024. In the past, we have conducted single materiality assess­ ments in the form of an impact materiality assess­ ment, which provides an inside-out perspective to assess ASSA ABLOY’s impact on the world. An impact materiality assessment forms one part of the double materiality assessment. The second part is a financial materiality assessment. This provides an outside-in perspective to assess the financial implica­ tions that potential material topics may have on the Group. We have reported according to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2021, which acts as a solid foundation when prepar­ ing our financial materiality assessment. Double materiality assessment process The following key activities take place during the double materiality assessment process, all of which help to inform the analysis. • Stakeholder survey • Workshop 1: Impact materiality • Workshop 2: Financial materiality • Analysis of survey, workshops and written documents • Workshop 3: Validation of draft list of material matters Impact materiality factors Severity factors and likelihood are graded as follows: • Scale: Large or small (how grave the negative impact is or how beneficial the positive impact is) • Scope: Large or small (how widespread the impact is, for example geographical extent, number of people) • Irremediability: High or low (to what extent a negative impact could be remediated) • Likelihood: High or low (for potential impact or actual impact) Impact materiality threshold A sustainability matter is determined as material when: • There is an actual impact or a potential impact with a high likelihood • With a value of large/high for at least two out of three negative severity factors (scale, scope, irremediability), and/or • With a value of large for at least one out of the two positive factors (scale, scope) Other impacts are scrutinized individually to see if scale, scope or irremediable character alone makes a negative impact severe enough to qualify as material. Financial materiality factors The likelihood and potential magnitude of financial effects are graded as follows: • Likelihood: High or low • Magnitude: Large or small Financial materiality threshold A sustainability matter is determined as material when: • It has a value of high likelihood and large magni­ tude in terms of either being a risk or an opportu­ nity, or both For financially-material matters, the material sub- topics match the sub-topics that are material from an impact perspective.

"70 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Double materiality assessment methodology We followed the steps outlined by the ESRS to conduct our double materiality assessment: 1. Stakeholder engagement: We conducted stakeholder surveys with over 500 stakeholders to understand the concerns and priorities of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and NGOs. 2. Materiality workshops: We carried out work­ shops to discuss both impact materiality (the sig­ nificance of the social and environmental impact of the company) and financial materiality (the importance of sustainability issues to enterprise value). 3. Preliminary findings: We compiled the prelim­ inary results from the workshops and surveys to identify the sustainability matters that are materi­ al to the company. 4. Validation process: We established a verification team made up of function heads and subject mat­ ter experts to validate the preliminary findings, where feedback was collected and incorporated. 5. Reporting: Our sustainability statement and An­ nual Report have been prepared in alignment with the CSRD reporting metrics and requirements, ensuring that it includes the updated materiality analysis. 6. Continuous improvement: We will use the outcomes of the materiality assessment to continuously improve sustainability practices and reporting. Process steps – Impact materiality We followed the five process steps for impact materiality as defined by the CSRD: 1. Engagement of stakeholders: We engaged internal subject matter experts, representatives from each division and all functional heads across the Group to attend and provide input during the impact materiality workshop. We ran a series of education and awareness sessions before the impact materiality workshop with all internal stakeholders to bring them up to speed on what disclosing to CSRD would entail. We developed a standardized survey for our wider stakeholders and received over 500 responses from stakehold­ ers; including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and NGOs. The output from the stakeholders was aggregated into focus areas to ensure the stakeholder input from the surveys was taken into account during the impact materiality workshop. 2. Scoping of impacts: We reviewed our previous materiality assessments and sustainability focus areas as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant topics. This provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the CSRD. 3. Assessment of individual impacts: As outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each impact, considering factors such as scale, scope, irremediability and likelihood. 4. Calibration of material impacts: We used the in­ put from our stakeholder surveys, internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. This ensured that the identi­ fied material topics are relevant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. Stakeholder and management review: The findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our Executive Team and the Board of Directors. This step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects ASSA ABLOY’s sus­ tainability impacts and material issues. This result­ ed in the identification of fifteen negative impact material sub-topics. The findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and Group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or Group strategy. Our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to CSRD as well as progress towards our sustainabili­ ty goals and objectives. Process steps – Financial materiality We followed the five process steps for financial materiality as defined by the CSRD: 1. Engagement of stakeholders: We engaged internal subject matter experts, including risk management and all functional heads across the Group to attend and provide their input during the financial materiality workshop. 2. Scoping of impacts: We reviewed our previous disclosures to TCFD and scenario analyses as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant financial topics. This provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the CSRD. 3. Assessment of individual impacts: As outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each risk, considering factors such as likelihood and magnitude. 4. Calibration of material impacts: We used the input from our internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. This ensured the identified material topics are rel­ evant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. Stakeholder and management review: The findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our Executive Team and the Board of Directors. This step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects ASSA ABLOY ́s sustainability impacts and material issues. This resulted in the identification of twelve financial material sub-topics. The findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and Group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or Group strategy. Our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to all CSRD Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) as well as progress towards our sustainabil­ ity goals and objectives."

"78 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures In 2024, ASSA ABLOY continued to explore and understand the requirements of the TCFD. We are gradually developing the process of reporting to the TCFD, to ensure it is meaningful and helpful in guiding our organization to make informed decisions based on climate-related risk and opportunity. We are firmly convinced the TCFD framework will enable us to identify and navigate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. We carried out our third climate scenario analysis during the year. The analysis reviewed the risks and opportunities of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks, to 2030 and 2050. The two different climate scenarios we reviewed were developed by the UN International Panel on Climate Control (IPCC): RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. The two scenario analyses were used to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities over the short and medium term to 2030, as well as the long- term to 2050. RCP 2.6, called Realizing the Paris Agreement, is a scenario where emissions decline rapidly over the coming decades, resulting in a temperature increase up to 2.3°C warmer by the end of the century. RCP 6, called The Rocky Road, is a scenario where emissions are declining at an insufficient rate and not to the level required, resulting in a temperature in­ crease up to 3.7°C warmer by the end of the century. Scenario analysis During the scenario analysis we added more context, where we tried to understand both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, especially for climate-relat­ ed risk. We developed the process to be able to quan­ tify our climate-related risk, in terms of percentage of sales from low risk to very high risk. Depending on the level of risk (from low to very high), the financial risk is then determined as percentage impact on total annu­ al sales. The analysis reviewed risks and opportunities relating to two different climate scenarios and how they could impact ASSA ABLOY’s business in 2030 and 2050. The outcomes are summarized in the blocks to the right. The Rocky Road – RCP 6 Temperature increases between 2 – 3.7°C Increased extreme weather events Fossil fuel-generated energy, poor air quality Forced migration Increased areas of water stress Ocean levels rising Opportunities/risks as a % of annual sales Low <1 % Medium 2–5% High 6–10% Very high is >10% Opportunities • Producing locally, a competitive advantage • Increased solution requirements • Technology will be a solution enabler • New markets • Increased focus on security Risks: Physical Risk (PR), Transition Risk (TR) • Coastal factories at risk of flooding (PR) • Supply chain uncertainty (TR) • Materials availability (TR) • Customer expectation (TR) • Ability to get insurance (TR) • Higher costs for emissions (TR) Realizing the Paris Agreement – RCP 2.6 Temperature increases between 0.9 – 2.3°C Lower frequency of extreme weather events Large-scale installed renewable energy Robust energy legislation and carbon taxes High energy effectiveness and efficiency Opportunities • New solutions reducing customers’ environmental footprint • Transition to circular economy • Local production will be an advantage • Increased resource efficiency Risks: Physical Risk (PR), Transition Risk (TR) • Availability of low-carbon materials (TR) • Need to upgrade and retrofit older sites (PR & TR) • Carbon taxes and market regulations (TR) • Customer expectation (TR) • M&A in higher risk geographies (TR) • Energy quality and availability (TR) Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors"
"79 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 For the climate scenarios we have applied two time horizons (2030) and (2050) which is in line with the Paris Agreement. However, for greenhouse gas reduc­ tion targets the time horizon is 2030. When conducting the scenario analyses, we reviewed several parameters to determine our resil­ ience, both for RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. For both scenarios we reviewed the potential impact on our supply chain, our own operations and our market and our customers; as well as assets and business activities. The focus areas were based on material financial risk and opportunity across the value chain. This included assessing countries where we operate, source from and markets where we are present. For example, by 2030 for our factories we assessed locations that are potentially exposed to acute risk such as flooding, sea-level rise and exposure to cyclones in regions that are at and close to sea-level; as well as locations that are exposed to chronic risk such as prolonged extreme heat and drought in countries such as United Arab Emirates and India. To perform the analysis, we assembled a cross-func­ tional internal team with deep knowledge and global sector expertise for their function, to represent the stakeholders in our value chain. Based on their knowl­ edge and expertise, we determined what the financial risk or opportunity was likely to be for the assessed categories of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks. Our strategy and business model, coupled with our focus to in­ crease our sustainability maturity in our supply chain, our own operations and innovation, through our sustainability target commitments and objectives, will ensure our company is resilient to the potential risks presented by both RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. There are no obvious uncertainties resulting from our analysis. For both scenarios, there is potential physical risk in our supply chain and own operations. Our operations have very limited exposure to acute and chronic risks, while our agile supply chain and innovation strategy will enable us to adapt to and/or mitigate risks as well as realize opportunities. We have implemented a process for upgrading facilities with lower energy efficiency to reach a higher energy efficiency and reduce our emissions in the coming five years. We will review the potential for trainings and ongoing learning opportunities for our personnel to make sure that our workforce remains resilient for future climate change challenges. The output and results from the scenario analysis RCP 6 and RCP 2.6 are presented graphically in the TCFD table on page 78. ASSA ABLOY has not identified which assets and business activities are incompatible with or need significant efforts to be compatible with transition to climate-neutral economy.

"90 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Due diligence Cease, prevent or mitigate Minimizing our environmental footprint in terms of water and marine resources, across our own opera­ tions and the entire value chain, is an integral part of ASSA ABLOY’s sustainability program. We identified water and marine resources as mate­ rial for ASSA ABLOY, considering impact materiality. We assessed this based on our own operations and our value chain. For our own operations we have a process to determine our dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. We do not have water-inten­ sive processes in areas with low water quality, which may jeopardize the quality of our products. We have a systematic process in place to mitigate the environ­ mental impact and water risk of our operations in high water-stress areas and downstream value chain. Use of water is seen as material regarding our own operations, but does not impact on oceans and seas. We take necessary steps to make sure the water we use and dispose to the municipalities from our opera­ tional processes such as painting, plating and cleaning is of the same quality level as water withdrawn it to mitigate any potential negative impact and risk to water bodies. The double materiality assessment outcomes, including water and marine resources, have been presented and consulted with our Board of Directors, stakeholders and other affected communities to engage them in the process and establish their views. Suggestions, opinions and comments regarding water and marine resources were taken into account in the final double materiality assessment. We continue to upgrade the infrastructure at our sites e.g. piping, additional meters to reduce leaks and implement monitoring systems at top water consuming sites, as well as introducing principles and processes to improve water efficiency. During 2024, water withdrawal decreased by two percent and water intensity by ten percent as a result of improve­ ment activities and infrastructure upgrades. Considering our own operations, the most water-intensive processes are the painting, plating and cleaning processes. There are 20 such entities, located mainly in the US, Europe and Asia, accounting for more than 60 percent of our total water consump­ tion. In factories with electroplating facilities, the water is used in the different process baths as well as for cleaning. In factories producing doors, the water is typically used for cleaning. An increasing portion of the water is recirculated and used again after purification. A wide range of purification methods are used across the Group, such as filtration, sedimenta­ tion, flocculation, ion exchange and reverse osmosis. The actions we take to improve our water efficiency and reduce consumption are applicable for each site which operates within the ASSA ABLOY Group in­ cluding entities located in areas at water risk. In 2024 the total amount of recycled water amounted to 19 percent of the total water consumption. An important part of our water management is to prevent water pollution across our sites. We are obliged to follow the local laws and the Group policy, to conduct regular audits and host third-party inspections. All entities across the Group are required to report known or potential site contamination map­ ping on an annual basis in our sustainability reporting system. The outcome of the report is being reviewed by a third party and relevant actions including remediations regarding historical contamination are being implemented and followed up. Site contami­ nation verification is also a part of our due diligence process in regard to new acquisitions. We ensure that any work with hazardous substances is organized to the highest standards, with wastewater being regularly disposed of and stored in designated areas, and secondary containment provided to contain and control potential spills. Risk mitigation in our own operations includes work to ensure that all factories with significant environmental impact and significant water-demanding processes are ISO 14001 certified. In the event that we do have a chemical spill, we have all the requisite equipment in place and spill kit to perform a cleanup immediately to remedy the incident. In the event the groundwater or local water body is contaminated, we will liaise with the relevant authorities to agree a remediation plan to remedy the contamination to the local legal level at a minimum. ASSA ABLOY’s long-term risk-management strategy covers sustainability aspects throughout our value chain, including water and marine resources. Within our supply chain, we carry out the same assessment as for our own operations. We review our suppliers’ production processes, taking into account environ­ mental dependencies, impacts, risks and opportuni­ ties. We ensure our suppliers have the same diligent controls as we do in our own operations. Our target is to reduce water consumption by 25 percent across all entities we operate in by the end of 2025, against our 2019 baseline year. Since we set up the target in 2020 there are no changes regarding measurement methodologies, significant assump­ tions, limitations, sources or adopted processes in data collection. The target is not mandatory based on legislation, but it is mandatory internally, which means all the divisions are required to contribute to realize the target. In 2024, against our baseline year 2019, we reduced our water intensity by 56 percent.

"92 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Due diligence Cease, prevent or mitigate The purpose of a circular economy is to ensure that resources and products stay in closed loops of usage that eliminate waste, rather than eventually ending up in landfill. Utilizing circular practices to optimize resource management is a key strategy to reduce the environmental impact of our products. Typically, a significant share of greenhouse gas emissions from a product’s lifecycle is derived from material extraction. The impact is allocated to the primary product usage. We see a trend that demand for sustainable solutions is increasing, and that more customers are eager to embrace circular options. Some customers are willing to pay a premium price for circular products. The most effective resource management strategy involves maximizing utilization and the product’s longevity. We believe that sustainable design prac­ tices and design for repairability and durability, with high-quality components and regular service and maintenance is the best option for extended life ex­ pectancy of our products. Our approach to circularity also includes more advanced strategies like reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing and increasing the share of recycled materials and parts. We believe that the processes, tools and methods that are covered later in this section cover all vital steps in the value chain so that we can eliminate the risk of sharing in­ accurate data. If a person is harmed, nearly harmed or assets are damaged due to a product failure, we have the requisite knowledge and infrastructure to carry out a product recall to investigate the root cause and take the necessary steps to remediate the issue. This ensures there will not be a repeated instance and the product can be used safely. Circularity will be a key enabler for reaching our sustainability goals and will help drive progress to­ wards the 2030 goal of 28 percent reduction of Scope 3 carbon footprint in absolute values from 2019 baseline. To reach our 2050 net-zero goal, it will be fundamental to have adopted circular practices. Upstream – resource inflows We source material and components based on low Global Warming Potential (GWP), as well as on high grade of recycled content. We utilize the same environmental data sets for our internal develop­ ment phase as we do when sourcing material and components. This simplifies calculations and allows us to steer sustainability optimization throughout the life cycle of a product. During 2025 we will build up the measures for recycled content in our internal systems to support reporting and awareness which is currently not possible for either products, material or packaging material. Going forward, our environmental data will be made more granular thanks to Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) based data for our most developed suppliers. ASSA ABLOY does not currently collect data regarding the absolute weight of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials used. For the total weight of products, the technical and biological materials used during the reporting period is 745,000 tons and divided between technical 99.97 percent and biological 0.03 percent. Our operations We utilize a sustainability reporting platform to col­ lect data related to waste management, energy con­ sumption and material usage. In circumstances where we lack actual data, we make calculations with proxy data, based on average figures for similar sites in our organization. Waste data from our twelve waste streams, disclosed on page 93 waste management ta­ ble, is obtained directly from our waste management providers. In our operations ASSA ABLOY employs advanced manufacturing methodologies such as lean manufacturing, value analysis and value engineering, and error-proofing techniques such as poka yoke to minimize waste generation and maximize resource efficiency. ASSA ABLOY has targets to 2025 compared to baseline year 2019 to reduce non-hazardous waste and hazardous waste intensity by 25 percent. During 2024 non-hazardous waste intensity reduced by eight percent, while hazardous waste intensity reduced by five percent. The targets are related to layer one in the waste hierarchy, prevention and minimization. The targets are not required by legislation. We do not currently have targets related to increase of circular product design, increase of circular material use rate, minimization of primary raw material, sustainable sourcing and use. ASSA ABLOY does not have the information to determine materials sourced from by-products or waste streams. Metal for recycling is our single largest waste stream. ASSA ABLOY does not generate radioactive waste. Innovation Our handbook for circular economy practices gives guidance and recommendations on how to make circularity an integral part of our product innovation process.

Due diligence Track The ASSA ABLOY Sustainability Compass visualizes sustainability aspects in every new project. The Sus­ tainability Compass is our own sustainable innovation tool, based on lifecycle thinking and circularity prin­ ciples. It helps minimize footprint, create awareness, and offer the ability to easily compare the sustaina­ bility implications of different designs. Durability of our products is both calculated and tested during development and then incorporated into our manu­ als. Since we develop so many products, we will not disclose this here on product basis. In many cases the durability is driven from regulations and thereby we follow the industry standard. The Sustainability Com­ pass supports circularity in development with the sections of reuse, recycled content and recyclability that ensures that we from the start design products with circularity in mind. Meeting the challenges of transitioning to a circular economy As a company where linear operations have been the norm, introducing circular practices calls for an ad­ justment of procedures related to logistics, repair and testing. To maintain the level of safety and security compliance we will test our products after installation to ensure intended operation and compliance with standards like the CE marking. If any issues occur with the products, we follow the procedures described in ESRS S4 Consumers and End-Users. Transitioning to a circular economy also requires a sufficient and reliable inflow of products and compo­ nents to our circularity repair centers to ensure that we can satisfy market demand. We will have to further improve the quality of sustainability related data in our entire value chain as new and more strict regulations are published. In turn, this implies new requirements for our internal data governance process, for both linear and circular products. Plans and actions to implement circularity at ASSA ABLOY The transformation to circular economy will be an iterative process where we first document internal best practice from the sites where we currently apply circular business models. Based on these best practices, we will develop our circularity strategy that will define the basis and starting point for our circular journey. This will also clarify resource allocation, and the funding needed going forward. Our approach will be guided by newly developed circular economy standards like ISO 59004, ISO 59010 and ISO 59020. Offering core principles and actionable steps, these new standards include assess­ ing circularity performance as well as guides on how to implement circular business models. Circularity will not be a universal process for all products, but rather a modular, and customizable approach. As an example, we expect that some entities will target recyclability, while others will focus on supporting customers with refurbished parts and components. ASSA ABLOY has joined a circularity development program, a collaborative effort aimed at accelerat­ ing the implementation of circular products in the construction industry. Driven by external experts and connecting us with construction industry peers, the program conducts in-depth sharing in focus areas and provides best practices. Based on these insights with internal stakeholders, we will further develop our policy, strategies, and measurements for circularity during 2025 and onwards. ASSA ABLOY does not have a circular economy policy; this will be developed during 2025."
