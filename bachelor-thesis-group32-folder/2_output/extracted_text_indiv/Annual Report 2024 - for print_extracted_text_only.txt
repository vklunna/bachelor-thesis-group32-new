"78 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures In 2024, ASSA ABLOY continued to explore and understand the requirements of the TCFD. We are gradually developing the process of reporting to the TCFD, to ensure it is meaningful and helpful in guiding our organization to make informed decisions based on climate-related risk and opportunity. We are firmly convinced the TCFD framework will enable us to identify and navigate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. We carried out our third climate scenario analysis during the year. The analysis reviewed the risks and opportunities of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks, to 2030 and 2050. The two different climate scenarios we reviewed were developed by the UN International Panel on Climate Control (IPCC): RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. The two scenario analyses were used to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities over the short and medium term to 2030, as well as the long- term to 2050. RCP 2.6, called Realizing the Paris Agreement, is a scenario where emissions decline rapidly over the coming decades, resulting in a temperature increase up to 2.3°C warmer by the end of the century. RCP 6, called The Rocky Road, is a scenario where emissions are declining at an insufficient rate and not to the level required, resulting in a temperature in­ crease up to 3.7°C warmer by the end of the century. Scenario analysis During the scenario analysis we added more context, where we tried to understand both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, especially for climate-relat­ ed risk. We developed the process to be able to quan­ tify our climate-related risk, in terms of percentage of sales from low risk to very high risk. Depending on the level of risk (from low to very high), the financial risk is then determined as percentage impact on total annu­ al sales. The analysis reviewed risks and opportunities relating to two different climate scenarios and how they could impact ASSA ABLOY’s business in 2030 and 2050. The outcomes are summarized in the blocks to the right.

Our MFP program consolidates sites to eliminate unnecessary duplication and maximizes our operational efficiency. Industrial CO2 elimination In the past, a limited number of sites used freon as a blowing agent in the door insulation process. Freon is a potent source of greenhouse gas emissions. By eliminating the use of Freon in our operations, we have dramatically reduced our Scope 1 emissions. Strategic sites energy overhaul ASSA ABLOY operates over 1,000 sites in 70 countries. The top 25 most energy-­ intensive sites account for more than 60 percent of Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Our workstream focuses on improving energy effectiveness and efficiency to significantly reduce the energy consumption of these sites. Continuous improvement In our revised Operational Excellence strategy, sustainability is one of the four key pillars. Sustainability is a key part of our global operational excellence maturity assessment, ensuring a focus on sustainability, and energy reduction is an organic part of how we operate every day. This results in hundreds of little ideas for improvement, which add up to a big impact. 1 3 2 4 Visualizing our Scope 1 & 2 emissions reduction pathway We use a standardized approach to identify and visualize the key levers required to enable the Group to achieve its 50 percent Scope 1 & 2 reduction target to 2030. The four-pronged strategic approach is replicated in all divisions, all business units and at the factory level. This standardized approach is applied throughout the Group and tracked on a quarterly basis, ensuring we are on track to achieving our climate targets. The investments needed to realize this plan are related to lever three and four. We do not have a separate investment vehicle to realize the plan, all investments are made through our capital expenditure process and follow the same rules as all other capital investments. Due to difference in the definition of CapEx and OpEx between EU Taxonomy and our financial statements, and the fact all capital invest­ ments must follow the same rules, our financial statement CapEx and OpEx does not tally with investments in carbon improvements. –50% Due diligence Cease, prevent or mitigate ASSA ABLOY has made a long-term commitment to address climate change by setting both near-term and net-zero science-based targets consistent with the Science Based Targets initiative. Our targets are aligned to a 1.5°C trajectory, the most ambitious aims of the Paris Agreement. We are fully committed to delivering on our am­ bitious science-based targets, to halve our absolute Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions and reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions by 28 percent by 2030, as well as achieving net-zero no later than 2050. Our four- pronged strategic approach to Scope 1 & 2 emissions is delivering positive results. We have reduced our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 36 percent, against our 2019 baseline. We have reduced our Scope 3 emis­ sions by 10 percent, against our 2019 baseline. Our Scope 3 emissions make up the vast majority of our total emissions and represent the carbon footprint of our wider value chain. Our Scope 3 target is challenging. To address this, we have assembled cross-functional science-based targets teams who are dedicated to driving the most important activities in our Scope 3 action plan to deliver on our targets. We have set up a science-based targets governance structure, which includes our Chief Financial Officer, to ensure we are on the right path to achieving our goals. Our environmental sustainability policy is aligned with our climate commitment. There are potential locked-in greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations in the form of our operations infrastructure such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, space heating equipment, compressors, transformers, heating and electrical process equipment.

"86 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors High level approach to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 28% by 2030 During 2024, we identified key levers to reduce emissions and help meet our Scope 3 target. We engage in value analysis/value engineering in product development to increase material effectiveness, choose low-car­ bon materials for our new products as much as possible, and prioritize the use of low-carbon transport and logistics. Together, these help us to develop energy-efficient products and solutions with a lower carbon footprint throughout their lifecycle compared with their predecessors. to its end of life, we will work to upgrade with low- carbon and increased energy efficiency alternatives to mitigate future locked-in emissions. We calculated our greenhouse gas inventory across our entire value chain for the first time, including our Scope 3 footprint, in 2022. Our Scope 3 footprint makes up 96 percent of our total footprint. More than 70 percent of our Scope 3 footprint is upstream in our supply chain, coming from purchased goods and materials. Some of our largest purchasing categories, which include steel, electronics, aluminum, brass, zinc and other metals and materials, are traditionally carbon intensive. This year we have made a significant change to our calculation methodology, moving from spend-based to a mix of spend-based method and average-data method, predominantly item weight data, but also material information. We have also expanded the list of possible materials from 20 to 190. Materials used more seldom may only appear once in this list, but for common materials like steel, we have many different types of steel, many different geographies for the origin of the material, all with individual emission fac­ tors. Further, the emission factors have been revised. In general, the methodology is that we use item quantity multiplied with item weight multiplied with the emission factor for the material in scope. If either the item weight and/or the material is unknown, we have methods to estimate these. Weight is estimated using a median value for the weight of other items within the same item category and the material is estimated by applying a default material, which we have done for all our category codes. These default materials are the most conservative option, meaning the one with the highest emission factor of the rele­ vant options, available, in order not to underestimate. For the spend-based component, that we still use if we don’t know the item weight, we have a much larg­ er sample size, causing the conversion factors to be far more accurate than in the past. All these changes combined have led to significantly lower numbers than we have presented before.

We work systematically with our supply chain partners to identify and implement effective initiatives to reduce our Scope 3 footprint, such as sourcing materials with higher recycled content or low-carbon alternatives. In addition, we support them to reduce their Scope 1 & 2 emissions, which has a knock-on benefit for our Scope 3 footprint. Sustainable Innovation All new products and solutions are developed using our Sustainability Compass, which ensures sustainability is embedded into all new products launched. We have developed a sustainability portfolio planning tool, which enables our pro­ duct management teams to have a targeted approach to driving improvements on the most carbon intensive product portfolios couple with the highest sales volumes. Value Analysis / Value Engineering Value analysis / value engineering is a mature continuous improvement process that enables us to design waste out of our product and manufacturing processes. We leverage this process to do more with less, reducing waste and lowering our products’ greenhouse gas emissions footprint. Logistics We work with our logistics partners to optimize both inbound and outbound transport, enabling us to service our customers in a faster way while reducing our Scope 3 footprint. We prioritize low-carbon transport methods such as sea, rail and road. 1 3 2 4"
"87 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors emphasizing that almost the entire reduction is due to a change in methodology and not actual reduc­ tions. Further, it is important to understand that the methodology is, despite being far more accurate than previously, still based on assumptions and simplifi­ cations in certain places and the emissions may still go up or down when even more accurate data will be available. Another important aspect to raise is the fact that even if we base the emission calculation on actual item weight or actual material information, this information is often not verified and could theo­ retically be incorrect. We believe our suppliers have a thorough understanding and correct data regarding the items they sell to us. Although we use a science-based and data driven approach, there is a degree of uncertainty where estimates are utilized. This presents a risk to the ac­ curacy of our Scope 3 footprint. We are continuously working to improve our data accuracy across our Scope 3 categories, while benchmarking with other complex organizations. We will also stay abreast of the development of the new GHG Protocol Scope 3 carbon accounting standard, which is due for release in 2026, to ensure our methodology is aligned. ASSA ABLOY has included 100 percent of subsidi­ aries' emissions under operational or financial in the target boundary, as required per the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard; which has been verified and ratified by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY does not have any significant joint ventures. Our Scope 3 data has been restated to include ac­ quisitions, where the data is available. Our Scope 1 & 2 data will be restated to include acquisitions during 2025. We anticipate the inclusion of Hardware and Home Improvement (HHI) will have a material impact on our baseline across all three emission scopes, when the data becomes available for us to restate. We do not anticipate significant risk or impact from acquisitions made in 2024. Our Scope 1 emissions are generated from energy burned on site in our operations such as oil and gas, CO2eq from industrial processes and fleet emissions. Reported normalized KPIs are based on cur­ rency-neutral monetary values and value added rather than sales – to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations and the ongoing restructuring of the Group. As a result, value added for intensity met­ rics is restated each year. By using value added as a measure, the normalized values are also not affected by the outsourcing of manufacturing. We believe this provides a more accurate picture of what is going on in the Group. Electricity emission factors are based on data on electricity production for 2010, as published by the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2012). These emission factors are used for calculation of emissions until end of 2016. In 2017 and again in 2024 ASSA ABLOY updated the emission factors used to calculate greenhouse gases from electricity consumption. The emission factors are based on the most recent data published by the IEA and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are expressed in CO2 equivalents (CO2 eq). Our transition plan to realize our long-term climate commitment is approved by the Board of Directors, our highest governing body with overall responsibility for sustainability. Sustainability is part of everything we do and is or­ ganically integrated into our overall business strategy; the transition plan is aligned to our business strategy and financial plans. The progress towards our transi­ tion plan can be seen in our carbon data table E1-6 gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions on page 89. We have excluded Scope 3 categories that are not relevant to our organization; for example, upstream/ downstream leased assets, as well as excluding categories which represent less than 0.2 percent of Scope 3, for example, capital goods, as approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. ASSA ABLOY is not taking any other actions besides that to mitigate negative effects on the environment and/or affected communities. We are working towards using primary data from suppliers, though to date we do not utilize primary data. We do not have a carbon pricing scheme at ASSA ABLOY. We do not have carbon removal projects in place and do not utilize carbon credits or offsets. There are no changes in target and corresponding metrics or underlying measurement methodologies, significant assumptions, limitations, sources and adopted pro­ cesses to collect data."

Emission factors for Scope 2 were updated during the year for 2024, using the latest available emission factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA); where the majority of the reduction between 2023 and 2024 comes from this methodology update 4 Emission factors are based on data published by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on ­Climate Change (IPCC, 2007). This indicator is the CO2 eq sum measurement of SOx, NOx, HFC-245fa, HCFC-141b, HCFC134a (R134a), CH4, VOCs and CO2­. 5 For comparable units. Total calculated CO2 emissions related to ­substances in industrial processes amounted to 777 metric tons, including units acquired during the year where data is available. 6 ASSA ABLOY follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for carbon accounting across Scopes 1, 2 & 3. We do not carbon account according to ISO 14064. Thirteen percent of market-based Scope 2 emissions are covered by contractual instruments such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) or Guarantees of Origin (GoOs). ASSA ABLOY does not purchase unbundled contractual instruments.

"70 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors Double materiality assessment methodology We followed the steps outlined by the ESRS to conduct our double materiality assessment: 1. Stakeholder engagement: We conducted stakeholder surveys with over 500 stakeholders to understand the concerns and priorities of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and NGOs. 2. Materiality workshops: We carried out work­ shops to discuss both impact materiality (the sig­ nificance of the social and environmental impact of the company) and financial materiality (the importance of sustainability issues to enterprise value). 3. Preliminary findings: We compiled the prelim­ inary results from the workshops and surveys to identify the sustainability matters that are materi­ al to the company. 4. Validation process: We established a verification team made up of function heads and subject mat­ ter experts to validate the preliminary findings, where feedback was collected and incorporated. 5. Reporting: Our sustainability statement and An­ nual Report have been prepared in alignment with the CSRD reporting metrics and requirements, ensuring that it includes the updated materiality analysis. 6. Continuous improvement: We will use the outcomes of the materiality assessment to continuously improve sustainability practices and reporting. Process steps – Impact materiality We followed the five process steps for impact materiality as defined by the CSRD: 1. Engagement of stakeholders: We engaged internal subject matter experts, representatives from each division and all functional heads across the Group to attend and provide input during the impact materiality workshop. We ran a series of education and awareness sessions before the impact materiality workshop with all internal stakeholders to bring them up to speed on what disclosing to CSRD would entail. We developed a standardized survey for our wider stakeholders and received over 500 responses from stakehold­ ers; including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and NGOs. The output from the stakeholders was aggregated into focus areas to ensure the stakeholder input from the surveys was taken into account during the impact materiality workshop. 2. Scoping of impacts: We reviewed our previous materiality assessments and sustainability focus areas as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant topics. This provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the CSRD. 3. Assessment of individual impacts: As outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each impact, considering factors such as scale, scope, irremediability and likelihood. 4. Calibration of material impacts: We used the in­ put from our stakeholder surveys, internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. This ensured that the identi­ fied material topics are relevant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. Stakeholder and management review: The findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our Executive Team and the Board of Directors. This step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects ASSA ABLOY’s sus­ tainability impacts and material issues. This result­ ed in the identification of fifteen negative impact material sub-topics. The findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and Group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or Group strategy. Our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to CSRD as well as progress towards our sustainabili­ ty goals and objectives. Process steps – Financial materiality We followed the five process steps for financial materiality as defined by the CSRD: 1. Engagement of stakeholders: We engaged internal subject matter experts, including risk management and all functional heads across the Group to attend and provide their input during the financial materiality workshop. 2. Scoping of impacts: We reviewed our previous disclosures to TCFD and scenario analyses as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant financial topics. This provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the CSRD. 3. Assessment of individual impacts: As outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each risk, considering factors such as likelihood and magnitude. 4. Calibration of material impacts: We used the input from our internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. This ensured the identified material topics are rel­ evant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. Stakeholder and management review: The findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our Executive Team and the Board of Directors. This step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects ASSA ABLOY ́s sustainability impacts and material issues. This resulted in the identification of twelve financial material sub-topics. The findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and Group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or Group strategy. Our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to all CSRD Minimum Disclosure Requirements (MDR) as well as progress towards our sustainabil­ ity goals and objectives."
"78 ASSA ABLOY | ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures In 2024, ASSA ABLOY continued to explore and understand the requirements of the TCFD. We are gradually developing the process of reporting to the TCFD, to ensure it is meaningful and helpful in guiding our organization to make informed decisions based on climate-related risk and opportunity. We are firmly convinced the TCFD framework will enable us to identify and navigate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. We carried out our third climate scenario analysis during the year. The analysis reviewed the risks and opportunities of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks, to 2030 and 2050. The two different climate scenarios we reviewed were developed by the UN International Panel on Climate Control (IPCC): RCP 6 and RCP 2.6. The two scenario analyses were used to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities over the short and medium term to 2030, as well as the long- term to 2050. RCP 2.6, called Realizing the Paris Agreement, is a scenario where emissions decline rapidly over the coming decades, resulting in a temperature increase up to 2.3°C warmer by the end of the century. RCP 6, called The Rocky Road, is a scenario where emissions are declining at an insufficient rate and not to the level required, resulting in a temperature in­ crease up to 3.7°C warmer by the end of the century. Scenario analysis During the scenario analysis we added more context, where we tried to understand both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, especially for climate-relat­ ed risk. We developed the process to be able to quan­ tify our climate-related risk, in terms of percentage of sales from low risk to very high risk. Depending on the level of risk (from low to very high), the financial risk is then determined as percentage impact on total annu­ al sales. The analysis reviewed risks and opportunities relating to two different climate scenarios and how they could impact ASSA ABLOY’s business in 2030 and 2050. The outcomes are summarized in the blocks to the right. The Rocky Road – RCP 6 Temperature increases between 2 – 3.7°C Increased extreme weather events Fossil fuel-generated energy, poor air quality Forced migration Increased areas of water stress Ocean levels rising Opportunities/risks as a % of annual sales Low <1 % Medium 2–5% High 6–10% Very high is >10% Opportunities • Producing locally, a competitive advantage • Increased solution requirements • Technology will be a solution enabler • New markets • Increased focus on security Risks: Physical Risk (PR), Transition Risk (TR) • Coastal factories at risk of flooding (PR) • Supply chain uncertainty (TR) • Materials availability (TR) • Customer expectation (TR) • Ability to get insurance (TR) • Higher costs for emissions (TR) Realizing the Paris Agreement – RCP 2.6 Temperature increases between 0.9 – 2.3°C Lower frequency of extreme weather events Large-scale installed renewable energy Robust energy legislation and carbon taxes High energy effectiveness and efficiency Opportunities • New solutions reducing customers’ environmental footprint • Transition to circular economy • Local production will be an advantage • Increased resource efficiency Risks: Physical Risk (PR), Transition Risk (TR) • Availability of low-carbon materials (TR) • Need to upgrade and retrofit older sites (PR & TR) • Carbon taxes and market regulations (TR) • Customer expectation (TR) • M&A in higher risk geographies (TR) • Energy quality and availability (TR) Sustainability statement | Report of the Board of Directors"
