"Environment E1 Climate Change1 ESRS E1 As an energy-intensive company, we take responsibility for the efficient use of energy and global climate protection, and are committed to the Paris Agreement. We are determined to follow the path toward climate neutrality and to enable our customers’ green transformation by providing low-emission chemistry. ESRS 2 IRO-1 ESRS 2 SBM-3 Our business activities result in the production of greenhouse gas emissions,2 which have a negative impact on the climate. These are emissions from our production, our energy procurement and our upstream and downstream value chain. We are working to achieve a considerable reduction in these emissions along the entire value chain. This also creates opportunities for our business activities: Thanks to our transformation toward climate neutrality, we can increasingly offer our customers products with a reduced Product Carbon Footprint (PCF). Resilience and scenario analyses At the same time, we have to position our business in line with the consequences of climate change and to create resilience. As a company that is active in a very wide variety of different regions and business areas, we take a diversified approach to climate change adaptation. We use our TripleS method (Sustainable Solution Steering, see page 161) to continuously review the resilience of our product portfolio with respect to environmental and social matters. We do this by categorizing our products into different segments. This enables us to quantify and steadily increase the proportion of products that contribute to sustainability. At the same time, products facing substantial regulatory, customer-specific or sustainability challenges are identified and removed from our portfolio within five years. As part of our business strategy development, we also examine the medium- to long-term resilience of our business models from an ecological, economic and social perspective, and with a view to their impacts, risks and opportunities. As regards climate change, this process only looks at transition risks and opportunities – we analyze physical climate risks and existing resilience centrally for our sites (see page 180). In 2024, we started embedding resilience analysis in our processes to a greater extent. The primary focus here is on our own business. The strategies of our business units are updated on a regular basis. This is done either individually at business unit level or as part of the overarching divisional strategy, and involves specialists from the business unit or operating division concerned and from our central strategy unit. In 2024, we piloted a method to address material topics in the strategies of the At a Glance Combined Management’s Report Consolidated Financial Statements Further Information BASF Report 2024 Sustainability Statement 178 1 Unless otherwise stated, all metrics in the text comply with the consolidation by financial control approach (see also the disclosures on consolidation for the nonfinancial reporting on page 151). The metrics listed in this section on the target-relevant Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are part of the statutory audit and have been audited with reasonable assurance. 2 The terms “greenhouse gas emissions” and “CO2 emissions” are used synonymously. They include all greenhouse gases in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
"Scope 1 and 2 Based on the 2018 base year, we want to achieve a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our production processes (Scope 1) and our energy purchases (Scope 2) by 2030.23 Our target focuses on emissions caused by our production and includes 96% of our gross Scope 1 emissions and 99% of our gross Scope 2 emissions. This means that we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 21.9 million metric tons to 16.4 million metric tons – despite our growth plans and the construction of a new Verbund site in southern China. This corresponds to a decrease of around 60% compared with 1990. Our long-term target is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.23 We consider future developments in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in line with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. When recalculating the emissions from the base year, we have set ourselves a limit of 5% cumulative deviations from the base year. Greenhouse gas emissions of the BASF Group (Scope 1 and 2)a Million metric tons of CO2 equivalents a Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties). The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e). b The figure for 2023 has been adjusted to reflect updated data. In 2024, the BASF Group’s emissions from production and energy purchases23 amounted to 17.0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2023: 17.0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents24). The slight rise in demand year on year lifted production volumes and thus resulted in higher CO2 emissions. At the same time, we increased the share of electricity from renewable sources compared with the previous year to 26% and, together with measures to increase energy and process efficiency, made a relevant contribution to reducing emissions. All in all, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions in BASF’s operations by 58% since 1990. Scope 3.1 We set ourselves an ambitious Scope 3.1 target25 for our specific raw materials-related emissions in 2023. This includes around 92% of our Scope 3.1 emissions based on the base year. By 2030, we want to reduce these in relation to the purchasing volume specifically by 15% from the 2022 base year. Consequently, we are planning to reduce our specific Scope 3.1 emissions from 1.64 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of raw materials purchased in the base year 2022 to 1.39 kilograms in the target year 2030.25 Through our commitment, we aim to keep our target-relevant Scope 3.1 emissions roughly At a Glance Combined Management’s Report Consolidated Financial Statements Further Information BASF Report 2024 Sustainability Statement 195 23 Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties). The emissions account for 96% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in relation to the base year. The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e). Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the market-based approach in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Based on the aforementioned emission reduction levers, we assume a reduction in Scope 1 emissions of around 14% between 2018 and 2030. We aim to reduce Scope 2 emissions by around 75% in the same period. The target is aligned with limiting global warming to a global average of 1.5°C, and is thus science-based. It has not been externally audited. 24 The figure for 2023 has been adjusted to reflect updated data. 25 Scope 3.1, gross emissions from raw materials excluding battery materials, excluding services, technical goods and greenhouse gas emissions from BASF trading business. The emissions account for 52% of total Scope 3 emissions based on the 2024 business year. The target is not science-based and has not been externally audited. We adjusted the baseline in line with the TfS Guideline in the reporting year due to the availability of further primary data."
"E2 Pollution Prevention ESRS E2 We work continuously to reduce environmental impacts caused by our business activities. This includes preventing or reducing emissions to air and water, which we achieve first and foremost by operating our plants safely and efficiently. We are also committed to our responsibility for environmental protection throughout the entire value chain in order to reduce the impacts on air and water. In addition, we develop product solutions for our customers that enable them to reduce emissions. ESRS 2 IRO-1 As part of our double materiality assessment conducted in 2024 (see page 167), the topic Environment was identified as material. In particular, the assessment identified emissions to air and water as relevant subtopics for the business activities of BASF. Emissions to air in the form of air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and ammonia, are produced in connection with energy generation and in our production processes. We use water as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent as well as to make our products. We utilize waterways for the purpose of transporting goods. Most of the water used at our production sites is purified and largely reused multiple times, before being discharged as wastewater. Organic substances and heavy metals, for instance, are thus emitted. Our double materiality assessment reveals nine material impacts on the environment and two material risks for BASF (see the table “Results of the double materiality assessment”). Regular emissions to air (excluding greenhouse gases; GHG) in connection with the manufacture of extracted raw materials Negative Upstream value chain (mining/mineral extraction industry) Emissions to air (excluding GHG) contributing to air pollution are generated in connection with the mining and extraction of raw materials in our upstream value chain in the mining and mineral extraction industries.

"E3 Water ESRS E3 Water is of fundamental importance in chemical production along the entire value chain. It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, and to make our products. Waterways are used to transport goods. At the same time, water is a scarce commodity in an increasing number of regions. That is why we promote the responsible use of this resource with sustainable water management. Our main business – the development, production and processing of chemicals – as well as the transportation of chemicals requires the responsible use of water as a resource. Firstly, we aim to use water as sparingly and efficiently as possible. Secondly, we want to minimize emissions of potentially harmful substances to water in our production processes and treat wastewater adequately. We address environmental, health and safety risks with a comprehensive Responsible Care Management System (see page 207). ESRS 2 IRO-1 As part of our double materiality assessment conducted in 2024 (see page 167), the topic Water was identified as material. The assessment identified six material impacts on water as a resource and one material risk for BASF (see the table “Results of the double materiality assessment”).

"E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems ESRS E4 Biodiversity is under threat. It is the foundation for functioning ecosystems. As a chemical company, we use valuable natural resources such as water, air and soil. At the same time, our business activities have an impact on these resources, for example through emissions to the environment or the sourcing of renewable raw materials. ESRS 2 IRO-1 As part of the double materiality assessment that we conducted for 2024 (see page 167), the topic Biodiversity and Ecosystems was defined as material. When performing the assessment, we drew on three sources of information, in particular: – Assessments of various stakeholders and assessments taken from specialist literature – Assessments by BASF experts – Digital sources The digital sources were evaluated using big data and AI analysis tools. We also used platforms such as the Biodiversity Risk Filter (BRF) of the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 2024, we also discussed our approach to biodiversity in our Nature Advisory Council, a body dedicated to topics related to protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. The Nature Advisory Council supports BASF in obtaining an independent societal perspective on our activities in relation to nature and biodiversity topics. At the end of 2024, the Nature Advisory Council comprised five members from the field of science, relevant value chains and multilateral organizations. Affected communities were not involved in the identification of material topics for the Biodiversity and Ecosystems cluster. ESRS 2 SBM-3 As a chemical company, our business activities interface with nature, and therefore with biodiversity and ecosystems, in three key areas. These are: – Sourcing of raw materials – Operation of production plants – Attributes of our products In order to better categorize and understand the impact of BASF on nature at our production facilities, in their immediate surroundings and throughout the value chain, we use the five drivers of biodiversity loss as defined by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES): Land-use change, pollution, climate change, overexploitation of resources, and invasive species. We also followed this logic in our double materiality assessment (see page 167). As the topic categories Climate Change and Pollution are examined at length in the chapters E1 Climate Change (from page 178 onward) and E2 Pollution Prevention (see page 205 onward), they are not discussed in detail in this chapter. The use of water as a resource is also explored in detail separately (from page 221 onward). We did not examine the driver “invasive species” more closely, as we do not consider it relevant for BASF. Thus, this chapter focuses on the topics surrounding land use and the impacts of our business activities on the land. No significant impacts were identified with regard to desertification and soil sealing.

"E5 Resource Use and Circular Economy ESRS E5 As the world’s population grows, so does demand for limited natural resources. At the same time, many valuable materials end up in landfill or in waste incineration. Using resources responsibly and closing loops are material for our business and achieving our sustainability targets. In our double materiality assessment, the topic Resource Use and Circular Economy was classified as material. For information on how the assessment was performed – including the tools used to do this – see the chapter General Disclosures, page 167 onward. We have identified five material impacts for BASF as a result of the assessment (see table below). The procurement and use of fossil raw materials negatively impact the environment through emissions, land use and environmental pollution. Waste arising at the end of the functional life of materials that are manufactured using our products may negatively impact the environment on disposal. At the same time, however, this waste also offers a potential opportunity for recycling raw materials and for closing material loops. We systematically record opportunities and risks as part of our general opportunity and risk management (for additional information, see page 87 onward). ESRS 2 IRO-1 To discuss critical issues and, if needed, develop solutions together, we seek dialog with our stakeholders. We are also involved in numerous sustainability initiatives to drive forward sustainability both in general and specifically in relation to our value chain. We are involved in networks, lobbying groups and associations in order to jointly promote sustainability topics. We cooperate with partners along the value chain, for example in the chemical industry’s Together for Sustainability initiative, and are involved in numerous networks such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). In doing so, we want to better understand requirements, trends and growth opportunities, and contribute to the development of standards. We use a Group-wide program to assess and develop new projects designed to promote the circular economy. We also address impacts, risks and opportunities by regularly assessing external, independent reports such as the Circularity Gap Report, which is published annually by the Circle Economy Foundation initiative. We have worked together with the WBCSD and other chemical companies to develop a Chemical Transformation Roadmap, which was published on the WBCSD website on October 1, 2024.
