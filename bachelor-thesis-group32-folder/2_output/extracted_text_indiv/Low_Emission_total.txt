"300 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 10.2. Carrying amount of investments in associates This note supplements the description of transactions set out in Note 2.2. The sale of most of the activities of Sopra Banking Software involved the transfer by the Group to Sopra GMT of 3.619 million of the 6.914 million shares it held in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). The sale was completed on 19 July 2024. It brought the Group’s stake in 74Software to around 15%. As part of the same transaction, the Group sold to Sopra GMT all its pre-emptive subscription rights to 74Software shares. As the latter funded the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software, in particular through a capital increase, the Group’s stake was diluted and only amounted to 11.1% following this transaction. The Group no longer exerts significant influence over 74Software, and the 74Software shares were reclassified under Non‐consolidated securities as financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.A €11.1 million profit from sale of business, recognised in Other operating income and expenses (see Note 4.2.3), reflecting the loss of significant influence. The sale of pre-emptive subscription rights, in the amount of €10.2 million, is recognised in equity as an item not reclassifiable to profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income. Through this operation, the Group received €106.2 million, including €10.2 million for the sale of pre-emptive subscription rights and €95.9 million for the sale of 3.619 million 74Software shares. As the sale of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares falls within the scope of IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, they are no longer measured using the equity method. Accordingly, no profit from 74Software associated with the shares that were sold was recognised. The carrying amount of investments in associates consisted mainly of the value of 74Software (formerly Axway Software) shares until the date on which they were sold, with the remaining shares recognised under Non-consolidated securities. It changed as follows: (in millions of euros) Carrying amount 31 December 2022 183.5 Changes in scope 0.2 Dividend distribution -2.7 Profit for the period 6.7 Translation adjustments -2.3 Other comprehensive income -0.4 Other movements 0.8 31 December 2023 185.9 Changes in scope -190.3 Dividend distribution - Profit for the period -6.7 Translation adjustments 2.2 Other comprehensive income 0.0 Other movements 9.9 31 DECEMBER 2024 1.0 At 31 December 2023, Sopra Steria Group held a 31.96% stake in 74Software (formerly Axway Software). This stake did not give the Group a controlling interest in this subsidiary and did not allow it to involve itself in the running of the business or influence variable returns from this subsidiary. The Group thus exercised significant influence. Recognition and impairment of investments in associates Investments in associates are initially recognised at acquisition cost, and their value is then adjusted to reflect changes in the Group’s share of their net assets. The remainder of this share appears under Equity-accounted investments on the asset side of the balance sheet. Its change over the financial year is recognised in profit or loss within Net profit from associates. Equity-accounted shares in a company constitute a single asset and must be tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill on associates is included in the value of equity- accounted investments, the value of which is measured inclusive of goodwill. As such, goodwill on associates must not be tested for impairment separately. At each balance sheet date, where there is an indication of impairment of an investment in an associate, the parent company must carry out an impairment test consisting of comparing the carrying amount of the relevant equity- accounted investment with its recoverable amount. Under IAS 36, the recoverable amount of an investment in an associate is the higher of its value in use, calculated on the basis of future cash flows, and the fair value of the investment less costs of disposal. Where an associate’s shares are listed, fair value less costs of disposal is equal to market price less costs to sell: in the absence of any firm sale agreement, this is the price at which the shares are currently trading. Any impairment losses are charged to profit or loss as Other operating income and expenses. Where there is an improvement in the recoverable amount of an equity-accounted investment such that the impairment loss may be written back, the full amount of the impairment loss, including the portion relating to goodwill, must be written back."
"303 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements Net cash and cash equivalents include available liquid funds (cash at bank and in hand), liquid marketable securities that meet the definition of cash equivalents, bills of exchange presented for collection and falling due before the balance sheet date, and temporary bank overdrafts. Net debt, as presented in Note 12.3, is more representative of the Group’s financial position. Marketable securities and other short-term investments include money-market holdings, short-term deposits and advances under the liquidity agreement. The risk of a change in value on these investments is negligible. Of the €423.4 million in cash and cash equivalents (excluding current bank overdrafts) at 31 December 2024, €323.2 million was held by the parent company and €100.1 million by the subsidiaries. Among the subsidiaries, entities in India contributed €36.0 million to net cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2024 (versus €25.5 million at 31 December 2023). Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, bank demand deposits, other highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included in current liabilities as part of Financial debt – Short-term portion. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value, with the exception of foreign exchange impacts. UCITS classified by the AMF (France’s financial markets regulator) as belonging to the “money market fund” and “short-term money market fund” categories are, for practical purposes, presumed to automatically meet all four quoted eligibility criteria. Other cash UCITS cannot be presumed to be eligible for classification as “cash equivalents”: an analysis must be carried out to establish whether or not the four quoted criteria are met. Cash equivalents are recognised at fair value; changes in fair value are charged to profit or loss under Cost of net financial debt. 12.3.

Borrowings are subsequently recognised at amortised cost; any difference between the capital amounts borrowed (net of transaction costs) and the amounts repayable is recognised in profit or loss over the duration of the borrowings using the effective interest method; ■NEU CP short-term negotiable securities, which have a maturity of less than 12 months and are recognised at amortised cost; ■NEU MTN medium-term negotiable securities, which have maturities spread over one to five years from issuance, and are recognised at amortised cost; ■current bank overdrafts. Financial debt repayable within 12 months of the balance sheet date is classified as current liabilities. 12.3.1. Bonds On 5 July 2019, the Group issued a €250 million bond to top-ranking institutional investors. The bond has two tranches: a 7-year €130 million bond with a fixed annual coupon of 1.749%, and an 8-year €120 million tranche with a fixed annual coupon of 2.0%."
"306 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.5. Financial risk management 12.5.1. Liquidity risk The Group’s policy is to have credit facilities at its disposal that are much larger than its needs and to manage cash centrally at Group level where permitted by local law. Moreover, subsidiaries’ cash surpluses or borrowing requirements are managed centrally, being invested or met by the Sopra Steria Group parent company, which carries the bulk of the Group’s borrowings and bank credit facilities. As part of its efforts to diversify its borrowings, the Group has a €300 million NEU MTN programme to supplement its €700 million NEU CP programme launched in 2015. In 2024, the amounts received from the sale of Sopra Banking Software and 74Software (€416.7 million) were used to fund the share buyback programme (€106.9 million), gradually reduce the amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme and make investments in the form of certificates of deposit maturing in less than three months with members of the banking syndicate. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme was €99.0 million at 31 December 2024 (€366.0 million in December 2023). Bilateral credit facilities were in place for a total of €92.0 million, with maturities in 2028. At 31 December 2024, they were drawn down in the amount of €67.0 million. At 31 December 2024, the Group had credit facilities totalling €1,978 million, 34% of which was drawn down. Undrawn available credit lines amounted to €1,302 million (€1,100 million in RCFs and €25 million in bilateral credit facilities), in addition to undrawn overdraft facilities for €177 million. Aside from the syndicated loan, bilateral credit facilities and bonds, the Group’s financing essentially consists of issues under NEU CP (short-term commercial paper) and NEU MTN programmes. These financing sources break down as shown below: (in millions of euros) Amount authorised at 31/12/2024 Drawdown at 31/12/ 2024 Drawdown Repayment terms Interest rate at 31/ 12/2024 €m £m €m £m Bond 250.0 - 250.0 - 100% At maturity €130m 07/2026 €120m 07/2027 1.87% Syndicated loan ■Multi-currency revolving credit facility 1,100.0 - - 0% 02/2029 * ■Bank borrowings 344.0 344.0 - 100% Amortising tranche of €224m & tranche due at maturity of €120m, maturing 12/ 2028 4.09% Bilateral credit facilities 92.0 67.0 73% 2026 to 2028 4.62% Other 15.6 15.6 - 100% 2025 to 2026 3.01% Overdraft 176.5 - 0.0 N/A Total credit facilities authorised per currency 1,978.1 - 676.6 - TOTAL CREDIT FACILITIES AUTHORISED (€ EQUIVALENT) 1,978.1 676.6 34% 3.30% Other types of financing used NEU CP & NEU MTN 119.0 2025 4.02% Other 10.0 2025 Total financing per currency 805.5 - TOTAL FINANCING (€ EQUIVALENT) 805.5 3.36% * The two one‐year extension options were exercised and unanimously approved by lenders in February 2023 and December 2023. Interest rates payable on the syndicated loan equal the interbank rate of the currency concerned at the time of drawdown (minimum 0%), plus a margin set for a period of six months based on the leverage ratio. The €250 million bond issued on 5 July 2019 has an effective interest rate of 1.749% for the €130 million tranche and 2% for the €120 million tranche. The bond issue is subject to terms and conditions, which include financial covenants. Two financial ratios are calculated every six months using the consolidated financial statements on a 12-month rolling basis: ■the first – known as the leverage ratio – is equal to net financial debt divided by pro forma EBITDA; ■the second – known as the interest coverage ratio – is equal to pro forma EBITDA divided by the cost of net financial debt. The first financial ratio must not exceed 3.0 at any reporting date. The second ratio must not fall below 5.0. Net financial debt is defined on a consolidated basis as all loans and related borrowings (excluding intercompany liabilities and lease liabilities), less available cash and cash equivalents. Pro forma EBITDA is Consolidated operating profit on business activity adding back depreciation, amortisation and provisions included in Operating profit on business activity before the impact of IFRS 16 Leases (see Note 1.6.1). It is calculated on a 12-month rolling basis and is therefore restated so as to be presented in the financial statements at constant scope over 12 months."

"100 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 3 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Compensation of company officers Lastly, in the event of exceptional circumstances (such as an exogenous shock) leading to the suspension of the normal system of variable compensation for employees and Group Executive Committee members, the Compensation Committee would review the situation of the Chief Executive Officer. It could recommend to the Board of Directors that it ask the shareholders at the General Meeting to approve the addition of a bonus to the Chief Executive Officer’s variable compensation if that would serve the Company’s interests, subject to an upper limit of 60% of his annual fixed compensation. Long-term incentive plans are based on awarding rights to shares. They are subject to the condition of being with the Company over a period of time and performance conditions. The targets are set in the same way as for variable compensation. Independently of the compensation policy, the Company covers or reimburses company officers’ travel expenses (transportation and accommodation). The procedure for determining compensation policy applicable to executive company officers and the timing of that procedure are intended to ensure that all useful information is taken into account when recommendations are drawn up and when the Board of Directors makes its final decision. This ensures that such decisions are consistent among themselves and aligned with the Company’s strategy. The Nomination, Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Compensation Committee have one member in common. The compensation policy applies to newly appointed company officers. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as to enable the replacement or appointment of a new executive company officer, the Board of Directors may waive application of the compensation policy. Such waivers must be temporary, aligned with the Company’s interests and necessary to secure the Company’s long-term success or viability. Furthermore, this option may only be adopted where there is consensus among the members of the Board of Directors as to the decision to be taken (i.e. no votes against). This may result in the awarding of items of compensation currently defined in the compensation policy as not applicable (severance pay, non-compete payment, supplementary pension plan). These items would be put to the vote at the following General Meeting. 2.2. Executive company officers The compensation policy for executive company officers was subject to recommendations made by the Compensation Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 26 February 2025. The compensation policy and any variable and exceptional items of compensation must be approved at the General Meeting prior to their payment. 2.2.1. COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Compensation policy for the Chairman of the Board of Directors, subject to approval at the General Meeting ITEMS OF COMPENSATION OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Items of compensation Comments Annual fixed compensation Set by the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation by the Compensation Committee Annual variable compensation Not applicable Deferred variable compensation Not applicable Multi-year variable compensation Not applicable Deferment periods; option of asking for variable compensation to be returned Not applicable Exceptional compensation Possible, by decision of the Board of Directors, but contingent upon very specific circumstances with substantial consequences on the role and activity of the Chairman of the Board of Directors Payment subject to shareholder approval of all items of compensation at an Ordinary General Meeting and in all circumstances capped at 100% of annual fixed compensation Stock options, performance shares and any other long-term items of compensation Not applicable Compensation referred to in Article L. 22-10-14 of the French Commercial Code Application of Directors’ compensation policy Any other benefits Company car Severance pay/benefit payable upon change of duties Not applicable Non-compete payment Not applicable Supplementary pension plan Not applicable"

"304 SOPRA STERIA UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2024 5 2024 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.3.2. Bank borrowings On 22 February 2022, the Group signed an agreement with its partner banks consisting of a €1,100 million non-amortising multi-currency credit facility tied to the achievement of environmental goals. Its ESG component does not constitute an embedded derivative. It is based on achieving a greenhouse gas emissions reduction aligned with a 1.5°C temperature increase scenario validated by SBTi for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and part of Scope 3. The target is to achieve a 68% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per employee by 2028 relative to a 2015 baseline. It is measured for each financial year and, if the target is met, will result in a 0.04% reduction per year in the applicable margin. In addition, the Company undertakes to pay an annual contribution equivalent to 0.04% of the margin applicable to sustainable projects, irrespective of whether it reaches the target. The Group’s achievement of its environmental performance targets in 2022 and 2023 made it possible to establish a dedicated fund of more than €0.2 million to fund innovative technology projects aimed at combating climate change. This agreement, with an initial term of five years, included two options to extend the expiry date by one year, exercised at the end of 2022 and 2023. The maturity of this credit facility is now set at 22 February 2029. At end-December 2024, this credit facility was undrawn. On 19 December 2023, the Group signed a contract with the same partner banks for a bank credit facility, drawn in the amount of €400 million, with a term of five years, comprised of a €280 million amortising tranche and a €120 million non- amortising tranche. This bank credit facility does not include an ESG component. Its balance at 31 December 2024 stood at €344.0 million. The Group also has several non-amortising bilateral bank facilities: some drawn to €67 million and others undrawn for €25 million, maturing in 2028. 12.3.3. Other financial debt In 2015, the Group arranged an unrated multi-currency NEU CP programme of short-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, in a maximum amount of €700 million. This programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was last updated in July 2024. The Group actively issued securities in 2024 and the average amount outstanding under the NEU CP programme grew, totalling €379.1 million in 2024, compared with €392.7 million in 2023. The outstanding amount under the NEU CP programme at 31 December 2024 was €99.0 million (€366.0 million at 31 December 2023), including floating-rate NEU CP amounting to €60.0 million and fixed-rate NEU CP amounting to €39.0 million. The NEU CPs are included in Other sundry financial debt. In December 2017, the Group arranged an NEU MTN programme of medium-term negotiable securities that was not underwritten, with a maximum amount of €300 million. As was the case for the earlier NEU CP programme, the NEU MTN programme is presented in documentation available on the Banque de France website, which was updated in July 2024. The NEU MTN programme pays fixed or floating rates, with a spread at each issue date. Maturities range from one to five years. At 31 December 2024, the outstanding amount under the NEU MTN programme was €20.0 million, maturing in November 2025 (€10.0 million at 31 December 2023). The NEU MTNs are included in Other sundry financial debt. 12.4.

The remainder corresponds to customer disputes, primarily in France, for €2.4 million. Provisions for tax risks other than income tax mainly concern risks relating to the R&D tax credit in France. Provisions for restructuring correspond to the cost of one-off restructuring measures, mainly in Germany (€0.9 million) and France (€1.7 million). Other provisions for contingencies mainly cover risks relating to clients and projects in the amount of €29.3 million (including €12.2 million in the United Kingdom, €7.9 million in France and €8.5 million in Germany), contractual risks (€6.8 million) and employee‐related risks (€4.2 million). Present obligations resulting from past events involving third parties are recognised in provisions only when it is probable that such obligations will give rise to an outflow of resources to third parties without consideration from said parties that is at least equivalent, and if the outflow of resources can be reliably measured. Since provisions are estimated based on future risks and expenses, such amounts include an element of uncertainty and may be adjusted in subsequent periods. The impact of discounting provisions is taken into account if significant. In the specific case of restructuring, an obligation is recognised as soon as the restructuring has been publicly announced and a detailed plan presented or the plan implementation has commenced. This cost mainly corresponds to severance payments, early retirement, costs related to notice periods not worked, training costs for departing employees and other costs relating to site closures. A provision is recognised for the rent and related costs to be paid, net of estimated subleasing income, in respect of any property if the asset is subleased or vacant and is not intended to be used in connection with main activities. Scrapped assets and impairment of inventories and other assets directly related to the restructuring measures are also recognised in restructuring costs. 11.2. Contingent liabilities The contingent liabilities recognised arose as a result of the Sopra-Steria business combination in 2014. At 31 December 2024, they totalled €6.0 million after tax, corresponding to tax and contractual risks in India. To the extent that a liability is not probable or may not be reliably estimated, a contingent liability is disclosed by the Group among its commitments given. By exception, in connection with business combinations, the Group may recognise a contingent liability on the balance sheet if it results from a present obligation arising from past events and its fair value can be reliably estimated, even where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be necessary to extinguish the obligation."

"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 156 Start Climate change Strategy Disclosure Requirement E1-1 – Transition plan for climate change mitigation As early as 2021, Sartorius identified key levers for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on the basis of a GHG emissions screening and initiated actions to reduce them. Building on this, the company is developing an ESRS-compliant climate change mitigation transition plan in fiscal 2025. Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement E1-2 – Policies related to climate change mitigation Sartorius’ ambition is to reduce the Group’s total GHG emissions to net zero by 2045. The Corporate Sustainability department is responsible for coordinating the topic of climate change mitigation. The company has not yet drawn up a comprehensive policy that includes general management principles and guidelines and the determination of specific responsibilities, as the initial focus – prioritized in line with resource constraints – was on launching specific climate change mitigation actions. Sartorius is currently working with internal and external experts to define a formal policy in this respect. The key content of the policy will include reducing GHG emissions and improving energy efficiency by putting various levers in place. Adapting the data basis so that the company can manage the resulting actions is fundamental to the policy. Sartorius aims to complete and publish the policy in fiscal 2025. Disclosure Requirement E1-3 – Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies Sartorius has already undertaken many actions at various levels to reduce GHG emissions in order to achieve its company-wide climate targets and continued to do so in the reporting year. Examples of actions underpinning the individual levers are: ▪ Energy & infrastructure: Supply contracts are gradually being converted to the purchase of electricity from renewable sources. Where it makes sense, Sartorius is installing solar panels on its own buildings. ▪ Supply chain: Sartorius has entered into dialogue with selected suppliers to discuss and agree on ways to reduce emissions. In particular, this includes the use of renewable energy. The Group is continually extending this dialogue to other suppliers. ▪ Logistics: The company is examining opportunities for reducing emissions by changing over to less GHG-intensive means of transportation. Specifically, transportation was switched from air to sea in the fiscal year. In addition, some established supply routes were converted to electric trucks with selected partners. ▪ Eco design for packaging: Packaging is being optimized in terms of its size and weight as well as the choice of material. This includes selecting less GHG-intensive materials and switching to mono-materials."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 157 Start ▪ Eco design for products: The design of products with regard to their GHG impact is particularly challenging in the pharmaceutical sector. Nevertheless, Sartorius is facing up to the task and has already launched a number of projects in this regard – including in collaboration with customers and suppliers. In particular, the focus is on alternatives to GHG-intensive crude oil-based virgin plastic. Sartorius is unable to report on the required MDR-A disclosures at this time as the Group has not yet formalized its action plan due to resource constraints. Consequently, the actions have not yet been fully quantified, scheduled, and assigned dedicated responsibilities and financial resources. The company is currently working on these steps. The results of these activities in terms of achieved and expected GHG reductions will be presented in future reports as soon as the action plan has been finalized and a consistent methodology for measuring GHG reductions has been implemented. Aside from the taxonomy-aligned operating expenditures (OpEx) and capital expenditures (CapEx) presented in the section on “Disclosures pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation)”, Sartorius has not reported any further OpEx and CapEx relating to climate change mitigation for the reporting year, as its climate change mitigation action plan has not yet been defined. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E1-4 – Targets related to climate change mitigation Scope 1 and 2 The Sartorius Executive Board has decided to reduce avoidable gross Scope 1 and market-based gross Scope 2 GHG emissions to zero by 2030. Gross Scope 1 GHG emissions resulting from the use of solvents and refrigerants are considered unavoidable emissions given the current state of technology. Accordingly, avoidable emissions include all energy consumption-related emissions. As vehicle fleet emissions were not available when the target was being set and so were not included in the base year, avoidable emissions are therefore defined as all stationary emissions. Likewise, biogenic CO2 emissions were not taken into account. The aforementioned Scope 1 and 2 target is an absolute GHG reduction target measured in tons of CO2eq. In addition, the Executive Board has decided that all external electricity procurement is to come from 100% renewable sources by 2030. The above-mentioned Scope 1 and 2 targets are designed to reduce GHG emissions and consequently the company’s climate-related impacts, thereby helping Sartorius achieve its ambition of reducing GHG emissions to net zero by 2045. The targets cover the stationary energy consumption-related business activities of Sartorius in its own operations worldwide and are based on the assumption that renewable energy will actually be available at Sartorius sites in 2030. The targets are based on Sartorius’ own ambitions along with the requirements of stakeholder groups and a comparison with the political and market environment. The main lever for reducing the targeted gross Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions is the use of renewable electricity and an energy-efficient building infrastructure. If Sartorius can electrify its whole building infrastructure, these targets would be fully achievable. Reduction of CO2 emission intensity In addition to the Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets, Sartorius has set itself the goal of reducing total gross GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) relative to consolidated turnover in 2021. Sartorius-specific “CO2eq emission"
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 167 Start ▪ 2 Capital goods: Here, emissions were calculated entirely on the basis of expenditures, i.e., without data from life cycle assessments of the capital goods. ▪ 9 Downstream transportation: Here, the emissions were estimated entirely on the basis of an expert opinion. ▪ 11 Use of sold products: The emissions were not measured by the actual energy consumption of the products, but calculated based on the estimated consumption of typical products. ▪ 12 End-of-life treatment of sold products: The emissions were based entirely on assumptions about global waste disposal, as no information was available on how customers actually disposed of the products Given the many estimates and assumptions involved, Sartorius currently treats the GHG emissions calculated on the basis of the methodologies described above as merely an indication. The GHG accounting will gradually be specified in more detail in the coming years so as to enable better management of emissions. In particular, this will involve switching from the spend-based calculation method to a more specific driver-based calculation method. Disclosure Requirement E1-7 – GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits In the reporting period, Sartorius did not develop any projects for the removal or storage of greenhouse gases, nor did it contribute to any such projects in the upstream or downstream value chain. Please also note that the company did not purchase or plan to purchase any carbon credits during this period. As such, no emission reductions or removals were financed or intended to be financed by climate change mitigation projects outside the value chain. Disclosure Requirement E1-8 – Internal carbon pricing No internal carbon pricing schemes were used or implemented in the reporting period. As such, there are no internal shadow prices, carbon fees or carbon funds that influenced decision-making or provided incentives for implementing climate-related policies and targets. Disclosure requirement E1-9 – Anticipated financial effects from material physical and transition risks This disclosure is not currently relevant for Sartorius because no material physical risks or transition risks were identified in the reporting year."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 168 Start Pollution Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement E2-1 – Policies related to pollution Compliance with local environmental protection laws and requirements is a core component of the Sartorius Group-wide Code of Conduct. Sartorius also endeavors to go above and beyond legal requirements in countries where the company operates and to minimize the environmental impacts of its business activities. Responsibility for this lies with the Sartorius sites, which have put in place corresponding management systems for this purpose. These systems not only guarantee legal compliance but also promote continuous improvement in environmental performance. They also use procedural instructions to govern the handling of hazardous substances at Sartorius sites as well as emergency planning for unexpected events such as sudden pollution, an accident or a natural disaster. Some of these systems are externally certified to the recognized ISO 14001 standard. To ensure that suppliers also take responsibility, Sartorius’ Code of Conduct for Business Partners requires that its business partners have an appropriate environmental protection management system in place and take appropriate environmental protection measures. The current policy at Sartorius is not yet coordinated and monitored Group-wide. The company is currently working with internal and external experts to develop and formalize a policy in this respect that will include definitions of general management principles and guidelines and the determination of specific responsibilities. Sartorius aims to complete and publish the policy in fiscal 2025. Disclosure Requirement E2-2 – Actions and resources related to pollution The Sartorius Group’s environmentally sensitive sites pursue environmental protection independently and provide the necessary human and financial resources. Preventing pollution caused by the use of hazardous substances is a particular priority. High volumes of hazardous substances are required in membrane production. So, for example, distillation plants are operated at the relevant sites in Göttingen, Germany, and Yauco, Puerto Rico so as to almost fully recycle the solvents in the production water and enable them to be reused. Non-recyclable solvent residues are disposed of professionally by contracted service providers. In accordance with official approvals, production wastewater is discharged into the sewage system or undergoes further treatment by external service providers. In addition, Sartorius provides transparency both locally and centrally about the hazardous substances it purchases and their use in the final products. In line with the EU Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) or other equivalent regulations on international markets, hazardous substances are managed and customers are informed about hazardous substances in products. Suppliers’ compliance with environmental protection requirements is monitored by self-assessments and audits under Sartorius’ human rights due diligence system. The company refers to its explanations in S2-1. The actions specified are ongoing, without a fixed time horizon. The company is currently working on formalizing its actions by scoping strategic targets, i.e. quantified actions with defined time-horizons and"
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 169 Start responsibilities and the requisite financial resources along with specific effectiveness monitoring. As such, the company cannot provide disclosures on financial resources at present. Likewise, achieved and expected progress on pollution as a result of these actions can also be presented in future reports as soon as a consistent methodology for measuring progress is in place. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E2-3 – Targets related to pollution The company has not yet set any Group-wide targets for pollution. This is because existing management is decentralized. In formalizing the pollution prevention policy, the company is working on setting up measurable, time-bound and outcome-oriented targets, including metrics to measure effectiveness for the entire Group. The company has decided not to define Group-wide targets at present as it is concentrating on the core development and implementation of policies and actions that address the main impacts, risks and opportunities relating to environmental pollution, such as the use of hazardous substances. Disclosure Requirement E2-5 – Substances of concern and substances of very high concern In the reporting year, the total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that were generated, used or procured during production (inflow amount) was 879 t. Most of this was reprotoxic or carcinogenic. The total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that left the company’s facilities in the form of emissions, products or as part of products or services (outflow amount) was 288 t. Most of this was carcinogenic (199 t). The difference between the inflow and outflow is mainly due to the fact that Sartorius sends a certain solvent to a recycling company for treatment after several usage cycles, then repurchases it. Total amounts of substances of concern 2024 Inflow: Total amount of substances of concern that were generated, used or procured during production (t) by main hazard class: 879 Reprotoxic 672 Carcinogenic 199 Persistent, Mobile and Toxic properties 4 Specific target organ toxicity (single exposure) 4 Respiratory sensitization 1 Outflow: Total amount of substances of concern under ESRS that left the company’s facilities in the form of emissions, products or as part of products or services (t) by main hazard class: 288 Reprotoxic 80 Carcinogenic 199 Persistent, Mobile and Toxic properties 4 Specific target organ toxicity (single exposure) 4 Respiratory sensitization 1 The total amount of substances of very high concern under ESRS that were generated, used or procured during production (inflow amount) was 17 t. The total amount of substances of very high concern under ESRS that left the company’s facilities in the form of emissions, products or as part of products or services (outflow amount) was also 17 t."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 171 Start master data and purchasing data. Where no net weight was available, figures were calculated by multiplying the expenditure by a self-determined weighting factor. The substances were assigned to hazard classes from the specified databases. The total amount of substances of concern leaving the company as emissions or products is assumed to be the same as the amounts purchased. The amounts of substances of concern that were returned to a recycling company for reprocessing and subsequently repurchased were deducted, as they did not leave the company as emissions or products. Validation: There is no external validation of the metrics as a whole or the individual components. Disclosures in relation to specific circumstances: Value chain estimation: This metric includes estimated data from the upstream value chain. In specific cases, some net amounts were estimated as described above, with self-calculated weighting factors. Sartorius is continuously working on improving its data processes. Sources of estimation and outcome uncertainty: As explained earlier, the calculated total weight of the inflow is partly based on an estimate of the net weight of the purchased components, products and materials. Equating the resource outflow with the resource inflow causes another uncertainty. As the Group currently has no standardized database for substances of concern, the disclosures are estimated using the purchasing system. Disclosure Requirement E2-6 – Anticipated financial effects from material pollution-related risks In line with ESRS, Sartorius will start reporting on the anticipated financial effects of these risks starting in 2027, as the legislator is introducing the reporting obligations gradually."
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 172 Start Resource use and circular economy Impact, risk and opportunity management Disclosure Requirement E5-1 – Policies related to resource use and circular economy Developing an approach to the sustainable use of resources is a complex challenge for Sartorius as a supplier to the biopharmaceutical industry. It requires the Group to harmonize various matters including sustainability but also quality, safety and efficiency requirements. For several reasons and based on various advantages, plastic-based single-use products from primary fossil feedstock, such as bags and filters, were introduced in the biopharmaceutical industry in the early 1990s. First, they help to reduce the risk of contamination that exists in stainless steel systems due to sometimes inefficient cleaning. They are also more flexible and so can be deployed more quickly in production facilities. As such, single-use technologies can speed up time-to- market for new treatments. But by law, single-use products normally have to be incinerated as contaminated waste at the end of their life. This means that recycling them is not possible as things stand in terms of current industry practice and infrastructure. These technologies are highly relevant to Sartorius’ business volume, accounting for around 60–70% of turnover. Sartorius firmly believes that it can improve resource use and circular economy factors relating to these products along the value chain. The Executive Board therefore reaffirmed its ambitions for this at the beginning of 2024, and discussed targets for managing it. In particular, this entails eco design, decoupling materials use from fossil feedstock, increasing the recyclability of products and avoiding operational landfill waste. The company has not yet drawn up a policy that includes general management principles and guidelines and the determination of specific responsibilities. Due to resource constraints, the Corporate Sustainability department is tackling topics one by one, with an initial focus on climate issues in line with the high level of internal and external interest. Sartorius is currently working on defining a formal policy. However, due to the complexity of the challenges involved, the only way to develop a specific approach to implementation is in consultation with relevant stakeholders. The Group therefore liaises ongoing with industry associations, but also bilaterally with customers, suppliers and the scientific community to discuss potential solutions. Disclosure Requirement E5-2 – Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy Sartorius is already taking numerous actions at various levels to implement its approach to resource use and circular economy. Sartorius continued its product life cycle assessment activities in the reporting year and leveraged the findings for product design optimization potential. The company also took action to reduce its raw materials consumption and the amount of waste in the value chain and own operations: ▪ Certain products in the Lab Products & Services Division were analyzed, primarily for the circularity principles of service life, reuse, repairability and recyclability. ▪ The Bioprocess Solutions Division investigated how bio-based and recycled raw materials can be used in Sartorius products in the reporting year. The ISCC+ certified mass balance"
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 173 Start approach allows these sustainable raw materials to be used in production and their sustainable properties to be transferred to the end products by means of a certificate. The sustainable raw materials need not necessarily be physically present in every product. Instead, the proportion of sustainable materials is calculated across the entire production chain and allocated to the end products. This ensures transparency and traceability in the supply chain. One advantage of this method is that the product properties remain unchanged, making it suitable for use in strictly regulated fields such as the pharmaceutical industry. In order to be able to use the mass balance approach, Sartorius began to have certain sites certified to the ISCC+ standard in the reporting year. Operational waste management is an ongoing action at some relevant production sites. This includes the avoidance, reuse, recycling and other recovery of operational waste before external disposal by contracted waste management companies. The aforementioned actions are not currently subject to a specific time horizon. Their expected outcomes include lower GHG emissions and lower pollution to the benefit of the world’s climate and ecosystem. The company is currently working on formalizing its actions by scoping strategic targets, i.e. quantified actions with defined time-horizons and responsibilities and the requisite financial resources, and monitoring their effectiveness. As such, the company cannot provide disclosures on financial resources at present. Achieved and expected progress on resource use and circular economy as a result of these actions will be presented in future reports as soon as a consistent methodology for measuring progress is in place. Metrics and targets Disclosure Requirement E5-3 - Targets related to resource use and circular economy The company is carefully analyzing the metrics first prepared and presented in ESRS E5-4 and ESRS E5-5 in fiscal 2024, to identify trends and develop and implement appropriate targets and actions. Due to resource constraints, the company has not yet implemented any targets for monitoring the effectiveness of resource use and circular economy policies and actions. In formalizing the policy, the company is working on setting up measurable, time-bound and outcome-oriented targets, including metrics to measure effectiveness for the entire Group. Disclosure Requirement E5-4 - Resource inflows Sartorius sources a wide range of raw materials and supplies to manufacture its products and product packaging – in particular, plastic, metal and electronic components and chemicals, and cardboard for product packaging. The plastics used are mostly primary materials from fossil sources. The company does not directly procure any critical materials. However, some purchased electronic components, for example chips, semiconductors and batteries, can contain i.a. critical materials like lithium, tungsten and silicon metal. In addition, rare earth metals are processed in the electronic components. The total weight of the technical and biological materials used to manufacture products and provide services during the reporting period was 20,625 t. This figure includes both the materials that were used directly in the production processes and those that were needed for packaging and additional services. The proportion of biological materials from certified sustainable sourcing cannot be determined for the 2024 reporting year. Although the company has integrated the technical requirements for this in the material master data system, it relies on information from suppliers. The company is therefore making use of a transitional"
"Sartorius Combined Group Management Report Sustainability Report 175 Start Disclosure Requirement E5-5 - Resource outflows Sartorius’ resource outflows are classified as products and waste. Key product categories include consumables and instruments (e.g., electronic products). The company does not currently manufacture any products that are explicitly designed according to circular principles. A large part of the product portfolio, the consumables, is in fact explicitly intended for single use due to legal requirements concerning quality and subsequent disposal by the customer. However, electronic products already address sustainability matters in that they are repairable and durable. In line with the European WEEE Directive 2012/19/EU, old appliances in the EU must also be taken back by Sartorius or by authorized partners and sent for recycling. In continuing to formalize its policy and actions on resource use and circular economy, Sartorius will examine additional possibilities for developing products according to circular principles. The expected durability of the products placed on the market by Sartorius relative to the industry average varies by product group. In the instruments product category, the expected durability of the products that Sartorius places on the market is 9 years on average. Larger biopharmaceutical devices last up to 15 years. Sartorius is not aware of the industry average and hence cannot make a statement on durability relative to the industry average. Services are used to increase the durability of sold products. However, as Sartorius offers a large number of repair and maintenance services, the company cannot make a blanket statement on increasing the durability of Group’s products. As regards repairability, Sartorius attaches particular importance to ensuring that its instruments are easy to repair. This includes the long-term provision of spare parts to extend the service life of the products and so minimize their environmental footprint. The products sold by Sartorius had an estimated recyclable content of 16%. This percentage relates to the instruments product category, where adhesive joints are largely avoided so that the individual parts can be easily separated and thus recycled. This supports the goal of a circular economy and reduces the environmental impacts of the products. In addition, 18% of the packaging is made from recyclable materials, which helps to reduce waste and conserve resources. Operational waste amounted to 8,550 t in the reporting year. Of this, 4,625 t were diverted from disposal and 3,924 t were sent for disposal, respectively accounting for 54% and 46% of total waste. The waste diverted from disposal breaks down as follows: Hazardous waste totaled 1,951 t. Of this, 0 t was sent for preparation for reuse, 556 t for recycling and 0 t for other recovery processes. Non-hazardous waste totaled 4,069 t. Of this, 29 t was sent for preparation for reuse, 4,040 t for recycling and 0 t for other recovery processes. The waste destined for disposal breaks down as follows: Hazardous waste totaled 1,395 t. Of this, 1,254 t was sent for incineration, 0 t to landfill and 140 t for other methods of disposal. Non-hazardous waste totaled 2,530 t. Of this, 750 t was sent for incineration, 977 t to landfill and 802 t for other methods of disposal. The total amount of non-recycled waste amounted to 3,925 t and accounted for 46% of total waste. The main types of waste in relevant sector-specific waste streams included hazardous waste (23%) and residual waste (22%). Other categories were waste paper (16%), plastic waste (15%), wood waste (10%) and other waste (15%)."

Climate change actions and resources at the own operation In line with its commitment to addressing climate change, the Bank has implemented and planned a series of key actions aimed at mitigating its environmental impact and achieving medium- and long-term sustainability goals: 1. Energy Ef昀椀ciency Initiatives: o Installation of photovoltaic panels on the roof of the VUB headquarters started in 2024, an additional installation is currently underway. o The Bank is progressively replacing obsolete air conditioning and electrical systems at selected sites, specifically LED re-lamping (6 premises), refurbishment of HVAC systems (20 locations), complete refurbishment of electricity consuming systems (5 branches), replacement of boiler (1 branch), refurbishment of natural gas-based heating (7 locations), replacement of windows and building envelope insulation (2 branches). ▪ A comprehensive energy efficiency study was conducted for all the Bank’s premises; ▪ A study on the deployment of LED lighting technology was conducted, with gradual implementation planned. 2. Transition to Renewable Energy: o The Bank finished a procurement process and from the next contractual cycle starting in 2025 the Group will purchase 100% renewable electric energy (Guarantees of origin) via bundled contract for own premises. 3. Fleet and Mobility Enhancements: o The company car fleet is undergoing a gradual transition to hybrid and fully electric vehicles. o Charging stations for electric vehicles are being installed at VUB premises. 4. Infrastructure Improvements: o Ongoing studies are assessing the feasibility of green roofs and green walls, renewable energy, use of sustainable cooling gases. 5. Paper and Material Usage Optimization: o The Bank has long sought and implemented strategies to reduce paper and material consumption. From 2024 onwards, all office paper is being procured exclusively from eco-friendly, sustainable sources. For main material categories there are defined criteria to minimize its negative impact. These actions are expected to contribute signi昀椀cantly to the reduction of the Group’s negative impacts in medium- term and serve as building blocks for long-term sustainability extending to 2050 Medium-term objectives include completing infrastructure upgrades and expanding the deployment of sustainable technologies. The Bank leverages its annual capital budget cycle to ensure funding for these measures while strategically allocating"

The implementation of the Code of Ethics has resulted in supplementary policies and procedures aimed at speci昀椀c areas of operations. For resource procurement, it is the Green Banking Procurement Rules that ensure responsible purchasing in areas such as energy, of昀椀ce materials, and sustainable renovations via identi昀椀cation of the best design solutions, products, or services from an environmental perspective throughout its life cycle, considering market availability. Key impacts considered include energy consumption and the resulting carbon dioxide emissions, waste generation, and the consumption of materials such as paper, toner, stationery, and of昀椀ce machines. The choice of supplier takes into account not only its specialization in the required product 昀椀eld and its economic and 昀椀nancial stability but also its reputational and sustainability pro昀椀le across all ESG areas. This includes assessing potential external risks, such as ongoing judicial and insolvency proceedings. In its operations, the Group adheres to the Environmental and Energy Policy of the Intesa Sanpaolo Group. This policy aims to minimize environmental impacts, manage ESG risks, and ensure compliance with regulations. It emphasizes ef昀椀cient resource and energy use, careful supplier selection based on ethical, social, and environmental criteria, and the prevention of environmental harm. The Guidelines for the Governance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks address climate change within the broader context of environmental risks across operations, the value chain, and the 昀椀nanced portfolio. These guidelines aim to mitigate material risks associated with climate change and support the transition to a low- carbon economy. The guidelines establish a framework for managing sustainability risks, stating key principles, specifying sectors sensitive to ESG or reputational risks, de昀椀ning responsibilities, and monitoring mechanisms. The core focus is placed on limiting exposure to high-carbon industries, integrating ESG risk factors into credit policies, and promoting sustainable 昀椀nancing solutions. The effectiveness of the policy is monitored through internal limits, ESG Committee oversight, and risk appetite thresholds. The guidelines apply across the entire Group, including all banking activities, risk management processes, and 昀椀nancing operations. They cover both corporate and retail portfolios, ensuring ESG factors are assessed in client screenings and sectoral risk evaluations. Exclusions apply primarily to the coal mining and oil and gas sectors, where stricter rules aim at phasing out exposure for coil mining. The policy aligns with international sustainability frameworks, including the UN 2030 Agenda, the European Commission’s Action Plan for Sustainable Growth, the EBA Guidelines, and ECB expectations. The policy takes into account the interests of key stakeholders, including regulators, investors, and clients, by balancing 昀椀nancial stability with sustainability goals. In lending activities, sustainability-linked 昀椀nancing and advisory services are provided to help clients transition to greener business models. The policy is integrated into internal governance frameworks and embedded in the Group’s risk appetite and credit policies, which de昀椀ne VUB Group’s lending portfolio strategy for each relevant sector based on ESG aspects, among others. Relevant guidelines are communicated to stakeholders through corporate reports, regulatory disclosures, and direct engagement with clients and investors. In order to steer the development of 昀椀nanced portfolio, the Group equipped itself with Rules for the classi昀椀cation of sustainable credit products and operations. This regulation applies to Group companies and outlines various categories of environmentally sustainable activities, with internal criteria different from the European Taxonomy, in favour of both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. The classi昀椀cation categories of credit products and sustainable credit operations have been de昀椀ned in line with the internationally recognized guidelines of the Loan Market Association (LMA) on Green Loan, Social Loan and Sustainability-linked Loan Principles. These principles provide a shared framework at a global level, promoting standardization and transparency of practices in the sustainable 昀椀nancial sector.

"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 347 and commercial real estate. The impact of climate-related hazards on 昀椀nanced non-昀椀nancial corporate clients was assessed using sector-speci昀椀c heatmaps, geolocation data across the relevant time horizons according to the maturity, applying NGFS and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios, providing insights into the potential future exposure and physical risk. To ensure a more precise risk assessment, loan portfolios were categorized based on maturity buckets (<5Y, 5-10Y, 10-20Y, >20Y) of the exposure. This approach, while distinct from the broader time horizons used in the Double Materiality Assessment (DMA), provides a more detailed perspective on risk distribution over time. With reference to physical risks of own operations the effective operational losses caused by disasters and other related events (operational risk) were considered. This includes meteorological phenomena, earthquakes, and 昀氀oods that could disrupt business continuity and cause 昀椀nancial losses. Based on the assessment performed, physical climate risks have been consistently identi昀椀ed as low or very low across all time horizons and traditional 昀椀nancial risk categories (credit, market, liquidity, and operational risk), thus reinforcing a stable risk pro昀椀le of the Group. With reference to the transition risks, the following analyses were carried out for the different reference perimeters identi昀椀ed: – Own operations: Operational risks (e.g., regulatory changes, energy transition requirements) and reputational risks related to any initiatives that may not align with Group's own sustainability commitments and climate objectives were assessed. This included evaluating potential challenges in adapting our operations to mitigate climate change impacts effectively; – Upstream value chain: Operational and reputational risks were evaluated concerning our suppliers. Specifically, the risk of engaging suppliers with insufficient or inadequate climate-related measures, such as inadequate management of greenhouse gas emissions. The potential for supply chain disruptions linked to the transition towards low-carbon alternatives were also examined; – Downstream value chain: Credit, market, and liquidity risks potentially arising from exposure to transition risks, such as changes in consumer demand, regulatory pressures, or shifts in market sentiment were assessed. The reputational risks related to Group's products and services, especially in light of evolving sustainability preferences among customers and stakeholders were also considered. Additionally, liquidity risks arising from the potential loss of institutional investors in case of failure to meet climate-related expectations were analysed, as that could affect access to capital and the Group’s financial stability. The identi昀椀ed transition events and their potential impacts on assets and business activities are as follows: – Short-term: Events such as increased pricing of GHG emissions, enhanced emissions-reporting obligations, and potential legal mandates on existing products or services. These events may lead to higher costs and changes in consumer behaviour; – Medium-term: Risks related to the failure of counterparties to define a transition plan, such as market risks and credit risks. These may affect the value of corporate bonds and the ability of counterparties to service debts, particularly if they fail to transition to a low-emission economy; – Long-term: The company may face reputational risks and potential exposure to litigation related to failure to meet climate targets or align with climate-related goals like those of the Net Zero Banking Alliance. These risks are linked to long-term exposure to regulatory changes and the transition to a low-carbon economy. The assessment of transition risks and opportunities has been primarily based on: – An analysis of real estate collateral and their EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) label, providing an overview of the energy efficiency distribution within the loan portfolio; – ESG sectoral assessment approach for Non-financial corporations (NFCs). This approach, common for all members of the ISP Group, provides a prudent, worst-case-scenario estimate of the NFCs susceptibility to a set of risk drivers, including, among others, physical, transition and environmental risk. This approach is mainly based on qualitative external sources analysis (qualitative top-down element) complemented by leveraging the granular and forward-looking results of the scenario analysis (quantitative bottom-up element). The top-down element analyses economic sectors’ vulnerability to C&E risks at large drawing on several external sources, thus leveraging on multiple perspectives in reaching a conversant evaluation. The bottom-up element leverages on climate stressed counterparty-level data, providing a more granular and forward-looking insight into the underlying vulnerabilities of the NFC portfolio. Together, these approaches help identify and qualify the risks economic sectors are exposed to; – A similar screening of individual borrowers, assessing their performance in ESG area through internally developed ISP Group ESG score. The Group identi昀椀ed several assets that need signi昀椀cant efforts to be compatible with a transition to a climate- neutral economy, especially within the 2030 milestone. These assets are mostly connected with downstream value"

"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 354 resources to areas of the highest impact. Successful implementation is also contingent on access to appropriate technologies, employee expertise, and supportive regulatory frameworks. Climate change actions and resources at the portfolio level In line with the regulatory evolution on sustainability, the Group adopts a medium-long term strategy and a cross- cutting and holistic approach to ESG issues, which is based on: – The definition of a Group ESG strategy; – The integration of ESG factors into the general Risk Management framework, particularly within the Risk Appetite Framework, where a specific section is dedicated to ESG risks and climate change; – The integration of ESG factors in credit processes and in the definition of credit strategies; – A careful evaluation of ESG factors in the development of policies, products and services; – The spread of ESG risk culture throughout the corporate organization. With reference to climate change mitigation, the integration of ESG risks into the Risk Management framework takes place through various actions. In particular, the RAF integrates and translates into speci昀椀c measures what is de昀椀ned in terms of strategic guidelines, ESG/Climate Materiality Assessment and ESG Sectoral Colour Coding, identifying year by year limits, Key Risk Indicators, and speci昀椀c actions aimed at containing ESG risks, with particular reference to the sectors most exposed to such risks. – Specific limits with reference to exposure to the Coal Mining and Oil & Gas sectors, particularly for Coal mining the limit is revised annually in line with the objective of phasing out financing by 2025; – The monitoring of new disbursements broken down by energy performance classes (EPC) with the aim of improving the quality of residential properties taken as collateral and, consequently, reducing the transition risk related to mortgage loans; – Specific Risk appetite limits on share of collateral with EPC classes F and G and with Very high physical risk in the Retail Mortgage portfolio, with the aim of improving the quality of residential properties taken as collateral and consequently, reducing the risk of transition and physical risk related to mortgage loans. In particular, with reference to the lower energy performance classes (APE certifications) and areas with very high physical risk; – Transactions with potentially high ESG risks undergo ESG & Reputational Risk Clearing process, utilizing the ESG profile and score of the counterparty and considerations on the impacts that physical and transition risk drivers can have. Within the ESG & Reputational Risk Clearing process, where the ESG pro昀椀le and score of the counterparty are used, which also includes considerations on the impacts that physical climate risk drivers might have. The actions reported are implemented as an essential part of the Group's strategy for managing climate risks and do not require speci昀椀c dedicated resources exclusively for these actions, as they are included in the general context of the Group's ESG strategy. An exact quanti昀椀cation of the reduction of emissions associated with each action at portfolio level is not feasible, due to the complex connection between the actions taken and the trend of emissions in the reference sectors of the counterparties. In 2024, the VUB Group continued its commitment to retail customers, both individual and small business, through the provision of mortgages and loans with environmental purposes. Via Green mortgages, the VUB Bank incentivizes clients with a preferential interest rate for 昀椀nancing a purchase of a property with high energy performance class (‘A’). Clients with other properties are encouraged to assess their energy ef昀椀ciency and when they provide a valid EPC, they receive a reduction of loan granting fee. In addition to offering a new mortgage the VUB Group has implemented a series of activities aimed at collecting the information on the energy performance of the properties that guarantee existing mortgages, which further raises awareness among clients and allow the Bank to precisely manage the associated transition risk. Green loan is a 昀椀nancial solution with incentive for clients who want to improve energy performance through, for example, the replacement of windows and high-yield boilers, insulation and the installation of solar and photovoltaic panels. To support sustainable transition of SME and Corporate clients, the VUB Bank introduced the TERRA product line, offering loans with preferential interest rates to support sustainability in areas of environmental, social and governance sustainability. Within the TERRA Enviro two products are offered: – GREEN S-LOAN+: Dedicated loan to support all types of corporate investments and projects capable of generating a positive environmental impact on processes, infrastructures, technologies, services and products in line with the LMA categorization (e.g., Renewable energies, Energy efficiency, Pollution prevention and control, environmentally sustainable management of natural resources, Clean transportation, Sustainable water and"
"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 355 wastewater management, Climate change adaptation, Eco-efficient and/or circular economy, Green buildings or Projects aimed at activities with zero CO2 emissions, such as electricity production using solar, wind, oceanic, hydroelectric technology). – ENVIRO LOAN: Dedicated loan supporting circular economy projects, including resource efficiency, sustainable sourcing, recyclability, and green innovation. For these loans, individual ESG KPIs can be set up with the client. Below is a summary of the total amount disbursed during the 2024 昀椀nancial year in the 昀椀eld environmental sustainability by business line: Business line Disbursed amount (in million EUR) Retail 599.2 Corporate 187.4 Amount disbursed in Retail Business line relates predominantly to Mortgage loan with EPC A and B. The disbursed data of the 昀椀nancings are calculated using management balances. The VUB Group supports sustainable choices of clients also in the area of investments. Please refer to the standard ESRS S4 – Consumers and end-users, section Sustainability-conscious investments by the VUB Group. Actions and resources related to supply chain To manage the impacts from value chain each vendor undergoes a quali昀椀cation process through the Supplier Portal. The evaluation of registered suppliers considers not only their economic-昀椀nancial and technical-organizational characteristics but also aspects related to business ethics, respect for human rights, workers' rights, and the environment. This evaluation is based on speci昀椀c questionnaires and/or the possession of certain certi昀椀cations (including ISO 50001 and 14001, and the adoption of an energy management system compliant with ISO 50001 standards). In 2024, completing the ESG questionnaire became mandatory as a prerequisite for participating in tenders or direct negotiations through the Supplier Portal and the ESG evaluation was incorporated into the technical assessment of the supplier’s offer in the tender evaluation."
"ESRS E1 – Climate Change 358 Scope 1 – Direct GHG emissions include emissions from sources owned or controlled by the Group: – The natural gas used for independent heating. The calculation is based on consumption data from meter readings, and emission factors by UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change); – The fuel used for the car fleet, including diesel used in back-up electricity diesel generators. The calculation is based on GPS monitoring of distance travelled, and invoices of fuel consumed by each individual vehicle (diesel, gasoline, gasoline-hybrid vehicles), regulatory infrastructure tests and servicing protocols of emergency generators, and emission factors are sourced from ISPRA (Instituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale); – The leaks of F-gases (fluorinated gases used as refrigerants). The calculation is based on servicing and maintenance protocols of respective equipment, and emission factors from the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The value of leaks in year 2024 was zero. Scope 2 – Indirect emissions result from the purchased or acquired energy generated off-site and consumed by the Group: – Electricity – The calculation is based on the fossil fuel-based electricity purchased from the supplier, documented by the invoices and meter readings, and emission factors using two approaches: o Market-based. The emission factor used is the ‘2023 residual mix’ factor for Slovakia, calculated by Intesa Sanpaolo. o Location-based. The emission factor used is ‘2023 national mix’ factor for Slovakia, obtained from International Energy Agency. – Thermal energy – fossil fuels district heating for central heating system. The calculation is based on natural gas consumption data acquired from a part of the lessors. For the remaining leased premises where the consumption data are not available an average consumption value per square meter was used. Emission factor was used from UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). Scope 3 – category 1. The acquisitions of goods and services concerned: – The paper used in office activities. The processes considered are those ranging from production to delivery to the Group. Emissions from production represent an average industry scenario, obtained thanks to the British government's conversion factors for reporting greenhouse gases. For all processes within the system boundaries, greenhouse gas emission factors were obtained from Ecoinvent 3.5. The IPCC 2013 equivalence factors were applied; – The use of datacentre services in the cloud. The annual Scope 1, 2, 3 emissions reported by suppliers are considered, relative to the services offered to the Group. Scope 3 – category 2. Regarding instrumental goods, the most relevant computer and electronic equipment purchased by the Group during the reference year are considered: PCs and laptops, monitors, printers, smartphones, tablets, ATMs, etc. Scope 3 – category 3. In the energy vector indicator, related to the Group's energy consumption, emissions related to the fuel supply chain, construction and operation of infrastructure, distribution and transmission losses are included. To characterize the impacts, regional data were used where possible, along with average European or global scenarios. Regarding electricity consumption, country-speci昀椀c ‘residual mix’ was used. Ecoinvent 3.5 emission factors were used, and IPCC 2013 equivalence factors were applied. Scope 3 – category 4. Regarding transportation and upstream distribution, emissions generated by the transportation of cash for ATM replenishment carried out by third-party companies on behalf of the Group are accounted for. To model the system, a transport with vans was assumed. Emissions include all phases of the life cycle: fuel supply chain, combustion emissions, and vehicle manufacturing. Emission factors from Ecoinvent 3.5 were used. Scope 3 – category 5. The waste-related emissions include the end-of-life treatment of special waste generated by the activities carried out by the Group. The evaluated phases include the transport of waste to treatment plants, as well as end-of-life treatment. For the remaining waste 昀氀ows sent to land昀椀lls, incineration or other treatment processes, the emission factors representative of Ecoinvent 3.5 were used. The IPCC 2013 equivalence factors were applied. Scope 3 – category 6. Emissions related to business travel are excluded from the signi昀椀cant emission stream. Scope 3 – category 7. Emissions due to home-to-work commuting of personnel are not calculated and are excluded. Scope 3 – category 8. Emissions related to upstream leased assets are excluded from the signi昀椀cant emissions stream. Scope 3 – category 10. Processing of sold products is excluded from the signi昀椀cant emission stream."
"ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystems 367 – Downstream value chain: Credit risk and market risk potentially arising from threats to biodiversity and the balance of the reference ecosystems were mainly considered. This could also determine elements of risk from a reputational perspective. The assessment results concluded that no risks were identi昀椀ed relating to the direct or indirect impact on the loss of biodiversity, the extension and conditions of ecosystems nor within its own operations nor within its upstream value chain perimeter. The Reputational Risk to which the Group is exposed if it resorts to suppliers who adopt less structured controls with reference to biodiversity and ecosystems has been assessed and evaluated as not material. The materiality analysis conducted for the standard in question, with reference to transition and physical risks related to biodiversity and ecosystems, relies on models and metrics that are still evolving, both in terms of methodology and standardization. In this regard, the development of reference methodological standards and the availability of increasingly granular and reliable data will enable further re昀椀nement of the materiality analysis and the incorporation of additional analytical elements. After performing the double materiality analysis, over all de昀椀ned time horizons, no material impacts, risks or opportunities related to Biodiversity and Ecosystems were identi昀椀ed. The VUB Group does not own or have an operational control over any relevant speci昀椀c sites of shared biological resources and ecosystems, raw materials production or sourcing that are near biodiversity-sensitive areas. Consequently, it does not engage in activities that negatively affect these areas or that may have negative or potential negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems or affected communities. VUB Group's assets are not classi昀椀ed as shared biological resources or ecosystems and, therefore, biodiversity mitigation measures are not considered relevant."
"ESRS E5 – Resource use and circular economy 369 With reference to risks, the following analyses were conducted: – Own operations: In consideration of the specificity of the VUB Group's core business and following in-depth analyses with the dedicated structures, no risks were identified relating to the topic of circular economy and use of resources; – Upstream value chain: The reputational risk to which the VUB Group is potentially exposed was mainly assessed, in the event that it uses suppliers who adopt less structured controls with respect to the topic in question (for example, lack of definition of an environmental policy); – Downstream value chain: The credit risk and the market risk potentially deriving from threats to the circular economy and the use of resources were mainly considered. This could also determine elements of risk from a reputational perspective. From the analyses conducted, for the purposes of 昀椀nancial materiality, signi昀椀cant reputational risks relating to waste management in the production process were identi昀椀ed, for both downstream and upstream value chain. With reference to the 昀椀nancial materiality of the opportunities, analyses were conducted mainly relating to the downstream value chain, taking into account the type of business of the VUB Group and the peculiarity of the 昀椀nancial activities. Analyses and evaluations of commercial opportunities were carried out in terms of 昀椀nancing of counterparties with the aim of improving their circular economy pro昀椀les and improving the ef昀椀ciency of production processes. Additionally, the possible presence of objectives and performance indicators related to the VUB Group's Strategy was considered. In light of the 昀椀nancial materiality analysis carried out, no signi昀椀cant opportunities emerged. Policies, actions and objectives related to resource use and circular economy Policies related to resource use and circular economy The circular economy policies of the VUB Group are in line with Intesa Sanpaolo Group's strategy, focusing on resource ef昀椀ciency, waste reduction, and value creation throughout the product life cycle. The goal is to facilitate the transition of businesses and territories to an inclusive circular economy, enhancing climate change mitigation, biodiversity restoration, and pollution reduction. This approach optimizes raw material use, regenerates natural resources, and fosters technological innovation, contributing to a sustainable, equitable, and resilient economic system. These policies cover all the VUB Group's activities, emphasizing internal resource management and 昀椀nancial support for circular business models, aligning with global sustainability trends and reducing resource price volatility risks. The Code of Ethics of the VUB Group integrates the principles of circular economy through environmental protection, support for the development of the country thanks to the ecological transition and the adoption of circular economy models, as well as through responsible management of indirect environmental impacts. Furthermore, the VUB Group adopted the following internal policies related to the circular economy in various areas: – In direct relation to the European Taxonomy, the Rules for the application of the European Taxonomy from a Green Asset Ratio (GAR) perspective, approved at Intesa Sanpaolo Group level and prepared in compliance with regulatory legislation, with the aim of outlining the rules necessary for the application of the EU Taxonomy and measurement of aligned economic activities with the fourth of the six environmental objectives set out in European legislation, namely ‘Transition to a circular economy’; – The Rules for the classification of sustainable credit products and lending transactions, which identifies a specific category in the field of environmental sustainability called ‘Ecological efficiency and circular economy’ assigned on the basis of the consistency of the credit transaction to a specific framework of five Circular Economy criteria, defined in collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF); – The ESG Scoring Rules outline how Intesa Sanpaolo Group and VUB Group evaluate the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance of its corporate clients, including SMEs that are often excluded from market ESG ratings. The ESG Score is used in key banking processes, such as: o Credit Risk Appetite Framework – defines the Bank’s willingness to take on risk for different customer categories; o Credit Strategies Framework – guides credit portfolio growth to balance risk and return over time. The ESG Score is a comprehensive rating based on multiple factors, including a speci昀椀c focus on the circular economy. – The Rules of operations, governing the waste hierarchy (prevention, preparing for re-use, recycling, other recovery, disposal), waste avoidance, minimization, separate collection and ways of disposal;"

"88 CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information In 2024, CNP Assurances voted at 84 General Meetings of 82 companies in 11 countries. These companies account for 100% of CNP Assurances’ directly held equity portfolio. It voted on 1,717 resolutions, approving 74.6% and opposing 25.3% of them. The negative votes predominantly concerned excessive remuneration for certain senior executives. A breakdown by topic of the votes cast by CNP Assurances is available in the report on its shareholder engagement policy on the cnp.fr website. In 2024, CNP Assurances continued its bilateral dialogues (16 direct dialogues and two dialogues carried out at its request by Ostrum AM) on governance, climate and biodiversity challenges. Engagement is organised with companies in which CNP Assurances is a shareholder or bondholder, as well as with asset management companies. In 2024, 41% of GHG emissions from direct holdings (equities, corporate bonds and infrastructure) were covered by the shareholder engagement work carried out by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries with the management of the companies concerned (bilateral dialogue or letters requesting a halt to new fossil fuel exploration and production projects). ESG-based investment selection CNP Assurances believes that including ESG criteria in investment decision processes contributes to value creation and enhances the risk-return ratio over time. Since 2006, it has implemented a strategy of ESG integration across all asset classes. Details of how ESG criteria are taken into account for each asset class are set out in the transition plan. Green investments Massive investments are needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C. These investments contribute to the energy transition and also help CNP Assurances to manage its transition risk. CNP Assurances is committed to increasing its green investment portfolio – green bonds, forests, environment-labelled buildings, green infrastructure such as renewable energy projects and low- carbon transport and mobility projects – to €30 billion by the end of 2025, from €10.4 billion in 2018. As of end-2024, the Group's green investments totalled €29.4 billion. Investments in forests In the forests owned by CNP Assurances, the fight against climate change is based on the natural sequestration of CO2 by trees through photosynthesis. The carbon captured each year by the Group’s forestry assets is monitored by estimating the wood’s organic growth during the year and then converting this biomass growth into captured CO2. In 2024, the gross quantity of CO2 captured by CNP Assurances' forestry assets totalled 483,653 tonnes of CO2. 2.2.1.4 Energy consumption and mix (E1-5) ESRS Reference 2024 E1-5_02 Total fossil energy consumption 6,020 MWh E1-5_15 Share of fossil sources in total energy consumption 28% E1-5_03 Consumption from nuclear sources 131 MWh E1-5_04 Share of consumption from nuclear sources in total energy consumption 1% E1-5_06 Fuel consumption for renewable sources, including biomass (also comprising industrial and municipal waste of biologic origin, biogas, renewable hydrogen, etc.) (MWh) 12 MWh E1-5_07 Consumption of purchased or acquired electricity, heat, steam, and cooling from renewable sources 14,956 MWh E1-5_08 Consumption of self-generated non-fuel renewable energy 283 MWh E1-5_05 Total renewable energy consumption 15,252 MWh E1-5_09 Share of renewable sources in total energy consumption 71% E1-5_01 Total energy consumption 21,404 MWh"

"CNP Assurances — 2024 Universal Registration Document 91 2 Sustainability Statement Environmental information 2.2.1.6 GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits (E1-7) In addition to its decarbonisation initiatives, CNP Assurances intends to contribute to climate change mitigation by financing projects beyond its value chain. This voluntary contribution is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Drawing inspiration from its parent company, La Banque Postale, in 2022 CNP Assurances set up its first carbon and biodiversity fund, which is based on an internal mechanism for monetising the Group’s carbon footprint (called an “internal carbon price”). Under this mechanism, CNP Assurances devotes an annual sum equal to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions multiplied by the internal carbon price to the following projects: • internal projects aimed at more effectively measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term; • external carbon credit purchasing projects; • internal or external projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity. This mechanism covers the entire CNP Assurances Group. The emissions taken into account are direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (Scope 2) and indirect emissions linked to business travel and commuting (Scope 3). In order to meet the Group’s carbon reduction targets in line with its corporate mission, the internal carbon price was increased as from 1 January 2023 based on the internal price used by La Banque Postale. Set at €60/teqCO2 in 2023 versus €10.5/teqCO2 in 2022, this new internal price is more closely correlated with the market price. Projects eligible for the carbon and biodiversity fund and focused on measuring and reducing GHG emissions over the long term cover emissions from three main sources: running of buildings, IT systems, and employee commuting/business travel. Projects aimed at preserving and restoring biodiversity are also eligible. In 2024, CNP Assurances' carbon and biodiversity fund financed: 1. the following internal projects: • reducing energy consumption at the data centre operated by CNP Assurances by shutting down 183 servers and replacing them with a cloud-based solution. Currently, all of the servers have to be running, even for a single user. The transfer to a cloud-based solution will have two advantages: the possibility of adapting consumption to usage and the fact that the cloud provider's data centre is more energy-efficient than the Group's data centre; • measuring the carbon footprint of external and internal web applications, which will make it possible to improve the measurement of CO2 emissions linked to CNP Assurances' use of digital technologies; • placing stickers on the glass façade of the Angers office building to prevent bird collisions; • planting greenery along the southern walkway of the Angers office building; • installing a nesting box for the kestrel that has taken up residence at CNP Assurances’ CTI in the Angers region; • the Serragem project, which began in 2007 and complies with the international Verified Carbon Standard. In 2024, CNP Assurances voluntarily contributed 9,469 teqCO2 to mitigate the effects of climate change. Serragem aims to combat deforestation by using biomass waste to replace firewood to fuel two ceramic factories in the city of São Miguel do Guamá, in the Brazilian state of Pará. Before the project began, the two factories together consumed 45,000 tonnes of Amazon forest firewood each year to fuel their kilns. Today, they use biomass in the form of acai seeds and sawdust, which used to be major sources of waste in the region. In addition to reducing GHG emissions and easing pressure on the Amazon forest, the project supports the local economy by creating jobs and new markets for local biomass suppliers. The project also creates environmental activities to reduce the impact of the ceramics industry and supports vulnerable groups through several social initiatives. The purchase of carbon credits is not intended to enable CNP Assurances to meet its direct or indirect greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. the following external projects • the Nature Impact fund, an initiative launched by WWF France aimed at financing projects designed to preserve, restore and sustainably manage forests with high biodiversity value in mainland France. The underlying purpose of this fund is to protect 15,000 hectares of woodland in France – the equivalent of a quarter of the woodland that has been placed under “strong protection” by France’s National Forestry Office – while enabling the capture of 400,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent over a period of 30 years. This fund is also being financed by La Banque Postale's carbon and biodiversity fund. CNP Assurances does not use the Nature Impact Fund to offset any of its GHG emissions, • in Brazil, in 2024, Caixa Vida e Previdência did not renew the voluntary financing of two projects initiated in 2023, but plans to do so again in 2025. The first of these projects – which is the outcome of a partnership between the Association of Extractive Reserve Residents (ASMOREX) and Biofílica Ambipar – is located in the Rio Preto-Jacundá extractive reserve and is aimed at reducing emissions by preserving forests, and promoting community development, education and healthcare. The second project, located in the town of Parnaíba, contributes to the production of wind power, • also in Brazil, CNP Seguranda set up a project called Conexão Amazônia in partnership with the Institute for the Conservation and Sustainable Development of the Amazon (Idesam), investing R$2.5 million. Through this investment, CNP Seguradora is supporting local non- profits to promote entrepreneurship and create income streams from socio-environmentally responsible value chains such as vegetable oil production, handicrafts and furniture-making. The project helps to support around 500 families facing social problems, improving their quality of life while promoting environmental conservation. CNP Seguradora's support will also enable more than 5,000 trees to be planted to restore deforested areas in the region. The partnership with Idesam was signed in March 2024, during the Brazil-France Economic Forum on The Transition to the Green Economy."

In particular, CNP Assurances considers that its investments could have a negative impact that could result in: • damage to ecosystems and public health [IRO 1]; • depletion of resources [IRO 1]; • biodiversity loss [IRO 1]. Reducing these negative impacts requires a responsible investment strategy. The general responsible investing approach applied by CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries(1) is tailored to the specific nature of each asset class. CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries’ approach is based on the principles of the Responsible Investment Charter and guided by the Global Compact principles, including protecting the environment. This approach contributes to seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Policies and actions relating to pollution (E2), water and marine resources (E3), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4) and resource use and circular economy (E5) are based on the pillars of CNP Assurances’ responsible investment strategy: • exclusion policy (1); • non-financial criteria applied in the selection and management of assets (2); • shareholder engagement policy (3). The responsible investment strategy is defined as part of the investment strategy approved by Executive Management and the Board of Directors. A dedicated responsible investment governance structure has been set up to enable the Board of Directors, Executive Management, the relevant committees and the investment teams to integrate ESG issues into their decision-making and operational processes. The governance framework in place to implement and track these policies is described in section 2.1.2.1 entitled “Role of administrative, management and supervisory bodies (GOV-1)”. The stakeholders consulted are detailed in section 2.1.3.2 “Interests and views of stakeholders (SBM‐2)”. The resources allocated to sustainable finance within CNP Assurances are detailed in section 2.2.1.1 “Transition plan for climate change mitigation (E1-1).” 2.2.2.1 Exclusion policy CNP Assurances excludes certain countries and companies from their investments on the basis of ESG (environmental, social and governance) criteria. In particular, some companies are excluded because they are involved in activities that may have a negative impact on the environment. The specific exclusion criteria for each sustainability matter – pollution (E2‐2), water and marine resources (E3-2), biodiversity and ecosystems (E4-3) and resource use and circular economy (E5‐2) – are described in the sections below about the actions and resources related to each matter.

Impact materiality is assessed based on the criteria of scale, scope, irremediable character, likelihood and long-term impact. Positive or negative impacts assessed as material will differ from one another in that they may have more or less serious impacts, be more or less far-reaching, be reversible or non- reversible, be actual or potential and have a more or less significant long-term impact. Materiality is assessed on a gross basis, i.e., without taking into account prevention, mitigation or remedial measures. The procedure for identifying and assessing impacts, risks and opportunities is described in section 2.1.4.1 “Description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO-1)”. 2.2.6.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy (E5‐1) ESG policy to reduce resource and circular economy-related impacts and risks CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries implement a uniform approach to responsible investment, detailed in the section on disclosure requirements covered in other environmental standards E2 to E5. 2.2.6.3 Actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy (E5-2) Taking resources and the circular economy into account in ESG criteria for directly held listed equities and corporate bonds The “Sustainable management of resources” pillar of the GREaT rating, used to manage the portfolios of directly-held equities and corporate bonds on behalf of CNP Assurances SA and its French subsidiaries, ensures that the principles of the circular economy are taken into account in the design, production and use of products/services in order to reduce pollution and encourage recycling. This criterion particularly includes elements relating to waste management and packaging. Taking resources and the circular economy into account in real estate The Green Works Charter requires management companies of the properties held directly by CNP Assurances and its French subsidiaries to carry out work in accordance with the principles of this charter, particularly in terms of the circular economy: • materials and technologies used: • use materials or technologies with a limited impact on the environment, • promote the use of recycled or recyclable materials, • conduct a critical analysis prior to the use of new processes or products that are theoretically more environmentally friendly; • works phase: • draft an organisational plan of the site, • manage and recycle waste, • limit consumption of resources, • Perform eco-monitoring of the site; • management of activity waste: • reduce waste at source, • implement waste sorting, • treat and reuse waste and track its collection, • assess the amount of waste produced; • circular economy: • assess the possibility of using deconstruction processes to recover and reuse materials wherever possible for each operation, • promote the use of recycled materials from wherever possible. The management companies are responsible for the risks associated with this charter.

"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 199 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 B – Alternative Fuels Capgemini is actively exploring and implementing alternatives that reduce our reliance on natural gas, diesel and LPG (currently used in several office locations for heating, back‐up generation and cooking purposes). Our combined natural gas, LPG and diesel emissions have reduced by 58% since 2019, as we have reduced the use of these fossil‐based fuels and transitioned to alternative solutions. We have installed dual feeder electricity supply at several Indian campuses, providing a secondary connection from the state utility and reducing our reliance on diesel generators if one supply experiences an outage. Looking forward, our climate transition plan will focus on a key focus will be on deploying Bio-Compressed Natural Gas across offices in India providing a more sustainable alternative to LPG within our campus kitchens and diesel used in generators. C – Renewables Capgemini has committed to transitioning to 100% renewable electricity by 2025, and as of the end of 2024, this transition was close to complete. 98% of our electricity consumption came from renewable sources in 2024, up from 28% in 2019. This has been achieved through a combination of installing large scale solar arrays in India (now accounting for 14% of electricity used in India), as well as the deployment of Power Purchase Agreements where feasible and procuring high quality renewable certificates elsewhere. During 2024, in collaboration with landlords, we installed solar panels in offices in Germany and Guatemala. We have also begun rolling out state‐of‐the‐art Battery Energy Storage Solutions across India to enable excess solar energy to be stored during the day and stored to be during evening peak hours, when the electricity grid tends to be more carbon intensive. Looking forward, we have an investment roadmap for the continued deployment of on‐site solar solutions and Battery Energy Storage Solutions at applicable sites. We will continue to assess the feasibility of installing on‐site solar solutions in partnership with our landlords. D – F-Gas Reduction We have reduced the fluorinated gas emissions from our air conditioning systems by 17% since 2019, with key areas of focus during this phase of the climate transition plan including: — HVAC System Upgrades: we have been upgrading heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to more efficient models that use lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants; — Regular Maintenance and Leak Detection: we have enhanced maintenance protocols to include regular checks and prompt repairs of any leaks in HVAC systems. This proactive approach minimizes the release of F-gases into the atmosphere; and — Employee Training and Enhanced Monitoring: we provide training to our facility management teams on best practices for handling and disposing of F-gases and ensure F-gas emissions are monitored and reported on an ongoing basis. We will keep improving the maintenance and operation of cooling and fire suppression systems to minimize accidental releases and reflect this in our operating standards. The focus going forward of our investment in this area is particularly around upgrading to more advanced HVAC systems, which are both more energy efficient and use refrigerant gases with a lower GWP than conventional F-gas. 2. Decarbonizing our Scope 3 emissions E – Extending product lifetime Whilst the majority of our purchases relate to services, rather than physical products, IT hardware and furniture are two key purchases where we have been exploring the potential to reduce GHG emissions through working with suppliers on extending product lifetimes. Together with a leading global office furniture designer and manufacturer, we have been cataloging furniture from closing offices to maximize opportunities for reuse in new spaces or donation (see Section 4.4.2.2 for details). For our IT hardware, we have been working with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to extend the working life of our laptops through a maintenance and refurbishment program, as well as ensuring more efficient models are used where replacement is the only option. This approach helps keep equipment functional and efficient for longer and allows the progressive adoption of circularity practices. We have committed to refurbishing 10,000 laptops by the end of the 2025, and by the end of 2024, around 7,000 laptops had been refurbished, avoiding an estimated 1,000 tonnes CO2e to date. (see Section 4.3.3.3 and 4.4.2.3 for details). Our focus going forward will be on continuing to work with suppliers to develop a pragmatic approach to managing extending product lifetime whilst also developing our internal processes to support repair and reuse. F – Supplier engagement and selection For most companies, supply chain emissions are the hardest both to measure and reduce. In 2024, 41% of our carbon emissions came from our purchased goods and services, meaning tackling this challenge is fundamental to achieving net zero. At the end of 2023, we launched our Supply Chain ESG Pledge to strengthen supplier engagement and support the achievement of our carbon reduction goals. The Pledge requires suppliers to disclose their annual GHG emissions, set science‐based targets validated by SBTi, and share their climate transition and low‐carbon product strategies. Throughout 2024, we fostered collaboration through supplier events and leadership discussions, creating opportunities to explore target setting, emissions tracking, and pathways to decarbonization. Our efforts have been recognized by CDP, earning us a spot on the 2023 Supplier Engagement Leaderboard for driving meaningful climate action within our supply chain. As a CDP supply chain member, we actively support our suppliers in calculating emissions and building their climate change capabilities. This partnership has enhanced the precision of our Scope 3 data while providing deeper insights into the progress and challenges suppliers face on their journey to net zero. We will continue to incentivize and encourage more of our suppliers to share carbon footprint data with us (bilaterally, through industry forums, or via data platforms such as CDP)."
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 200 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 We will continue to develop our systems capabilities to analyze carbon data and enable our models to be updated with the latest data available from our suppliers and partners as they decarbonize their products and operations. We will also develop our organizational capability by deepening our understanding of carbon calculation methodologies, so that we can draw further insights from our carbon data to support decision‐making and supplier selection as well as increase our weighting of environmental assessment criteria within our RFP processes with suppliers. G – Sustainable IT Ensuring the implementation of sustainable IT practices across our operations and value chain is critical in contributing to improving our energy intensity and progressing our net zero transition. During 2024, we continued the development of our energy management software on across Group laptops to monitor and optimize energy usage. The software enables optimized configuration management, which ensures both proactive maintenance and efficiency. Additionally, we replaced hardware‐based phones with a software‐based communication solution, enabling us to decommission over 75,000 IP phones since 2021. We continue to consolidate and modernize our data center environments using private cloud platforms and we are increasing our adoption of public cloud services, which typically have lower energy consumption and carbon emissions. We are also transforming our enterprise application portfolio by investing into more modern technologies such as cloud and SaaS platforms. As an outcome of this modernization and rationalization, legacy applications are being retired from the portfolio, reducing the underlying infrastructure footprint. H – EV Fleet Our membership of the EV100 initiative commits us to transitioning our car fleet to 100% electric vehicles by 2030. Capgemini has committed to transitioning its entire 12,000‐vehicle fleet to hybrid and electric vehicles by 2030. Our first phase of this climate transition plan has focussed on phasing out pure petrol and diesel cars (employees can no longer order new vehicles unless they are electric or plug‐in hybrid), as well as introducing a new cap of 50 gCO2/km for new hybrid car orders to encourage more sustainable choices. In 2024, 26% of our vehicles were pure EVs and 71% when including plug‐in hybrids. We have also installed over 2,600 electric vehicle (EV) charge points in place around the Group, providing our employees with charging for their vehicles. Our next phase, from 2025, will be to start to phase out plug‐in hybrid vehicles where practical. We will also continue to roll out more charging capabilities to support the uptake of both company and private EVs and offer financial incentives to employees who choose to lease or purchase electric vehicles. We will continue to develop partnerships with leasing companies that offer attractive deals on EVs for employees, as well as run awareness and education campaigns to inform employees about the benefits of EVs, both for the environment and for personal cost savings. Additionally, we will work with EV100 to advocate for policies and investment in public infrastructure that support wider adoption of electric vehicles, including expansion of public EV charging infrastructure in markets where we operate. I – Virtual Collaboration A significant area of focus has been on investments in IT solutions and equipment to support hybrid working and virtual collaboration, empowering our people to work seamlessly from anywhere, anytime. Building on the foundation laid during Covid, we have upgraded office spaces with advanced AV technologies, enabling efficient connections and collaboration while reducing emissions from both office commutes and business travel. During 2023, 49 meeting rooms with obsolete AV infrastructure were refreshed with more energy‐efficient AV equipment, and 185 meeting rooms were upgraded to video‐enabled meeting rooms to enhance the experience of hybrid work environments. In 2024, we continued this momentum, improving the collaboration technology in a further 1,200 meetings rooms (see Section 4.3.3.3 for details). Looking ahead, we remain focused on exploring the latest innovations and technological advances to enable employees to connect and collaborate effortlessly, reducing GHG emission from both. J – Sustainable Mobility and and Working from Home We offer a variety of country‐specific mobility programs to support sustainable commuting, which are tailored in response to the commute patterns and improvement opportunities in each country. In Germany and the Netherlands, employees benefit from comprehensive mobility packages, including public transport access for private travel, while other countries like Italy, Spain, and France offer subsidized or discounted public transport. To encourage cycling, we provide financial support for bikes and e‐bikes in countries such as the United Kingdom, Netherlands, France, and Portugal, alongside initiatives like cycling clubs and repair workshops in Germany. In the UK, employees are supported with webinars on home energy efficiency, access to energy assessments, and interest‐free loans for implementing recommended improvements. Recognizing that there are still many locations where car is the preferred option, initiatives like ride‐sharing and carpooling have been deployed for example in India, as well as EV charging infrastructure to support and encourage EV adoption across the Group are underway in multiple regions. In India, we have invested for many years in providing a comprehensive company bus service for employees. Going forward, we are looking to switch our bus fleet to bio‐compressed natural gas powered buses to reduce commuting emissions. K – Education The Sustainability Campus, launched in 2022, provides a dynamic training platform designed to equip all employees with the knowledge and tools to address environmental sustainability challenges. Continuously enriched since its inception, the Campus offers tailored programs for every role, empowering employees to understand the impact of their work and drive positive change. The Campus provides training at three levels: 1) Sustainability Awareness: A foundational module introducing key environmental sustainability challenges for our planet, our organization and our clients, updated in 2024 with a new version introduced by our Group CEO. In 2024, this training was translated into multiple languages and became mandatory for all employees, alongside ethics and cybersecurity modules; 2) Role-Specific Training: Customized modules that address the unique challenges and actionable insights for technical and non‐technical roles across the Group; and"
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 201 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 3) Expertise Development: Advanced training on specialized topics linked to industry and clients offers such as hydrogen and biodiversity, food waste and biodiversity. To deepen expertise, we also launched extended programs in collaboration with leading universities such as the University of Exeter (UK), Stanford University (US), and ESSEC (France), providing participants with certification upon completion. In 2025, we plan to integrate sustainability‐related questions into our monthly global employee pulse surveys to gauge understanding and sentiment, ensuring we continue to refine our approach and foster meaningful engagement. L – Business travel During this initial phase of our climate transition plan, our first focus in 2021 was on re‐envisioning our Group Travel Policy to ensure sustainability was fully embedded, with clear guidelines around how sustainable choices should be prioritized. The policy has been strengthened further since, with a requirement that employees take the train instead of traveling by plane for all journeys that can be reached by rail in less than three hours. The policy also encourages rail travel for journeys of four hours or less. Annual travel targets are cascaded to each country by our Net Zero Board, and we monitor progress monthly through carbon dashboards, enabling us to pinpoint unexpected trends and alert key stakeholders quickly. Over the last two years, we have launched and developed a new set of travel dashboards across our global sustainability network, enabling the better tracking of travel emissions and more granular analysis of air travel in particular. These dashboards provide faster access to information about the progress of each country against our targets, as well as enabling tracking across different business units and different travel modes. They also provide very detailed insights such as the most frequent flight routes for different employee grades. To ensure locally relevant plans are in place to address business travel, we will continue cascading travel targets to each country and working with country sustainability teams to ensure action plans are in place these at a country level. Alongside this, we have reviewed and enhanced best practice guidelines for Group events, including policies on travel modes, to ensure alignment with our sustainability objectives. In 2025, we will publish comprehensive guidance to support the decarbonization of our annual events. Additionally, we will focus on enhancing our management information dashboards and carbon accounting processes to provide accurate, up‐to‐date insights that empower the business to make informed and efficient travel decisions. As part of our continuous sourcing strategy, we are also assessing the viability of leveraging sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to support reductions in air travel emissions. 3. Our governance Our Net Zero Board provides executive level governance for our environmental sustainability program and our climate transition pathway with responsibility for monitoring climate risks and reviewing, debating, and approving the climate transition plan, as well as other sustainability plans, policies and practices for the Group. Our net zero program and our climate transition pathway are underpinned by two key management systems: our global Environmental Management System and our carbon accounting system. Please refer to Section 4.3.2 “Our governance dedicated to climate change” for more information on Governance. e) Nature and climate solutions Achieving a global net zero by 2050 requires nature and climate tech solutions for removing carbon from the atmosphere in addition to global decarbonization efforts. The voluntary carbon market offers a mechanism to fund the investment in solutions that are needed. Carbon removal credits can also play a valuable role when a company has met its long‐term reduction target, to help mitigate the final percentage of emissions which cannot be abated. Whilst our primary focus is on actions to decarbonize our own business, we recognize this will take time and are therefore also investing in at scale nature and climate tech solutions to abate and remove carbon from the atmosphere now. Please refer to the Section related to Nature and Climate Solutions of Section 4.3.3.3 “Actions contributing to our net zero program” for more information. f) Engagement strategy Working with others across is essential to achieving an economy‐wide transition. Addressing the systemic issue of climate change requires collective action and collaboration beyond our own value chain. Please refer to Sections 4.3.3.3 “Actions contributing to our net zero program” and 4.3.4 “Helping clients achieve their sustainability objectives” for more information on how we are committed to adding our voice together with other businesses from our sector and beyond, to amplify our messages, create momentum and exert pressure to accelerate action on topics where it is urgently needed. Our ability to deliver our climate transition plan will rely on sufficient investment, resources and collective action from across the whole Capgemini Group as described in this Section 4.3.3. In particular, committed investments for the period 2025 to 2027 should amount to around 16 million euros of Capex and Opex. The most significant investment planned is in India, where the majority of our employees are based and there is a very strong focus on energy efficiency in buildings, renewable energy generation and transportation initiatives. There are examples of important investments given throughout this Section 4.3.3, whilst in Section 4.6 we provide further details of capex eligible and aligned to EU Taxonomy. Committed investments have been assessed using the impairment test process implemented for the consolidated financial statements to ensure connectivity of information. Given the nature of our business, it is likely that additional investments will be decided in the coming years as we progress in the transition plan. 4.3.3.2 Policy contributing to our net zero program a) Environmental Policy 2024 Through our Environmental Policy, we have made a global commitment to continually improving our environmental performance against our Group objectives and targets (science‐ based targets where feasible) and to working with our clients to help them reduce their environmental impacts. We are also committed to train our employees on the impacts of their work on the environment and regularly consult with key stakeholders on environmental issues, ensuring our environmental program is responsive to their feedback."

The sub‐policies and strategies that underpin our Group Environment Policy are typically formulated at a function level and then debated and discussed both by the Cross-Function Committee and the Net Zero Board, with more significant decisions going to the CEO for final approval. The Group Environmental Policy is published on our website for external stakeholders, as well as being made available internally on noticeboards. 1. Energy Our focus is on ensuring our buildings are the most sustainable, operating them with optimum efficiency, and rapidly transitioning to 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We support reducing energy consumption where practical and cost‐effective across all sites from which Capgemini operate, whilst maintaining a comfortable and productive working environment. Through the implementation of our Energy policy, we cover ISO 50001 across seven countries, as well as our continued commitment to RE100. Our buildings also meet LEED, IGBC and BREEAM certifications (please refer to Section 4.3.3.3 “Actions contributing to our net zero program” below for more information). Looking ahead, our strategy prioritizes achieving the highest sustainability standards for our buildings, optimizing operational efficiency, and completing the transition to 100% renewable electricity."

Our sustainable IT transformation roadmap focuses on four key areas: 1) Reducing IT energy consumption: Reducing IT energy consumption and thereby lowering the use‐phase emissions from IT equipment energy usage; 2) Reducing embedded carbon footprint and adopting circularity: Reducing the embedded carbon footprint of purchased IT equipment and services, and progressively adopting circularity practices (including extending usable life of IT equipment and minimizing e‐waste); 3) Investing into sustainable IT tools and talent: Investing in sustainable IT tools and talent for monitoring, governance, and reduction of our footprint; and 4) Enabling digital collaboration: Enabling enterprise‐wide sustainable digital collaboration tools usage to support lower carbon delivery (hybrid working) models. Data Centers In our own captive data centers, we utilize energy‐efficient equipment to power the IT loads and efficient air conditioners for cooling. We monitor Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) and source our electricity from renewable sources (with 100% of electricity used at owned and leased data centers from renewable sources in 2024). We manage PUE through smart containment technology, using rack‐wise sensors controlled by an AI-powered engine. This system modulates the air conditioners and active floor tiles to optimize both cooling equipment and airflow, resulting in improved PUE across our data centers. All of this is centrally managed, monitored, and controlled via our Energy Command Center (ECC). Working with Group Procurement and our cloud infrastructure teams, where feasible we also monitor the energy consumption, PUE, water usage and carbon emissions associated with Third Party Managed Data Centers. AI and Cloud Services In terms of the growing presence of AI, our research shows that more than three‐quarters of organizations are conscious of environmental concerns around Gen AI (1). We recognize the need to weigh the immense potential of Gen AI against its cost to the planet and society. We are committed to taking a “sustainable by design” approach to developing Gen AI solutions that harness cutting‐edge data, AI, and climate tech to maximize business outcomes in a sustainable manner. Mitigation strategies include optimizing the amount of data required to train the models, working on smaller, task‐specific energy‐efficient models that employ more efficient training and operating algorithms, and powering the AI infrastructure with renewable energy as well as using more energy‐efficient data centers. We are starting to monitor energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with AI models to help promote transparency (1) Capgemini 2024, Gener(AI) ting the Future, Conversation for Tomorrow. around AI developments. Our Gen AI lifecycle analysis tools help organizations to mitigate environmental impact. Our Group IT team also has an internal policy in place to ensure that AI is not deployed without qualified use cases. These use cases are reviewed and approved by Group IT management after thorough evaluation. Recognizing the growth in this area, we are currently setting up a dedicated GenAI Board to approve use cases in the future. We also have a cloud‐first policy for building and operating IT solutions and services. Our employees are also provided with mandatory training around Generative AI, including on its sustainable and responsible use. For public cloud services, we engage leading hyper‐scalers providers that are leaders in sustainability practices. 3. Travel & Smart Delivery As a global business with over 340,000 people across more than 50 countries, travel remains a significant contributor to our carbon emissions. Our travel and smart delivery strategy comprises of three key parts: 1) Reduce business travel emissions through our low carbon digital delivery model: Our Group Travel Policy provides clear guidelines to ensure sustainable choices are prioritized. Last year, we strengthened this policy, with a requirement that employees take the train instead of traveling by plane for all journeys that can be reached by rail in less than three hours. The policy also encourages rail travel for journeys of four hours or less; 2) Transition to an electric vehicle fleet: Our membership of the EV100 commits us to transitioning our car fleet to 100% electric vehicles by 2030. We no longer allow the ordering of pure petrol and diesel cars, and at the beginning of 2023, we introduced a cap of 50 gCO2/km for new car orders, which prevents the ordering of mild hybrids; 3) Reduce the impacts of employee commuting: we enable our employees to work effectively and more sustainably remotely, as well as offer several mobility support options for commuters. These range from company‐provided shuttle buses and free EV charging across some sites to heavily subsidized public transport and assistance for bike and e‐bike purchases in select countries. In some countries, we provide energy efficiency advice and support for employees working remotely, such as home energy assessments and interest‐free loans for energy‐saving improvements. Our Group Travel Policy will be reviewed in 2025 as part of a continued annual review process consulting all central functions with sustainability as an integral pillar to its development. 4. Supply Chain We have procurement processes that encourage our suppliers and business partners to provide products and services that align with our Group environmental objectives. Our ESG Pledge is now a part of our sustainable procurement engagement process with suppliers. Working with our major suppliers and partners on the pledge will support our journey to net zero."

"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 204 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Our strategy covers the following key areas: — engaging with our suppliers and supporting them in their net zero journeys; — setting minimum standards that our suppliers are required to follow, as well as enhanced expectations for key suppliers; — identifying high emission categories, and defining actions and strategies to reduce emissions; — incorporating sustainability into supplier selection processes, ensuring carbon impacts are visible alongside costs during decision making; and — underpinned by robust processes and systems to measure and monitor supplier emissions and emerging climate risks, with continual focus on improving data quality. Our approach to a sustainable supply chain is reflected in our commitment to reducing our absolute purchased goods and services emissions by 50% by 2030, validated by the SBTi. Capgemini also has CDP supply chain membership to engage our suppliers, help identify climate risks and opportunities and to more accurately calculate emissions associated with our purchases. 5. Nature and Climate Solutions Whilst our primary focus is on actions to decarbonize our business, with a target to reduce our carbon emissions by 90% across all scopes by 2040, we are also investing in nature and climate tech solutions to abate and remove carbon from the atmosphere today. Acting to address global net zero Currently achieving a global net zero by 2050 requires nature and climate tech solutions for removing carbon from the atmosphere in addition to global decarbonization efforts, and the voluntary carbon market offers a mechanism to fund the investment in solutions that are needed. We know that carbon removal credits can be used when a company has met its long‐term reduction target, to mitigate the final percentage of emissions which cannot be abated. However, we also believe that long‐term corporate objectives are not sufficiently addressing the high concentration levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases already in, and continuing to enter, the atmosphere today. These greenhouse gases are central to driving the current climate crisis. For these reasons, in addition to reducing our emissions as set out in our carbon reduction targets, we will retire carbon credits on a ton‐for‐ton basis against the residual carbon emissions, associated with our direct operations from 2025 and against the residual emissions including our supply chain from 2030. We recognize that questions over the integrity of carbon credits remain. We believe it is essential to align on the standards about how to best invest in carbon removals and abatement through nature and climate solutions. We welcome the ongoing work of organizations such as the Voluntary Carbon Market Initiative (VCMI) and the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (IC-VCM) to bring greater integrity to the supply and use of carbon credits and helping to close the loop on unsubstantiated carbon related claims. We will continue to review the developing guidelines and legislation. (1) We have excluded certain project types from our program. Most of the projects and credits available to date do not pass our assessment criteria, which includes, but is not limited to, additionality, permanence, leakage, integration with Indigenous Peoples and local communities, biodiversity, social and economic co‐benefits and contribution to systemic change. In addition, we have defined acceptable levels of emissions reductions & removals calculations according to project type. The full list has been through the highest governance channels, and it is subject to change in a rapidly evolving market. Our principles for nature and climate tech solutions Since establishing our carbon credit program, our policy and approach has been underpinned by a clear set of principles for investing in carbon credits, which are updated here. — Decarbonize first: Rapid and ambitious decarbonization of our own GHG emissions must be at the heart of our climate commitment. — Contribute to ‘global net zero’: We have a responsibility to act beyond the decarbonization of our own operations to address the impacts of the climate crisis today. — Support high‐quality carbon credit projects: We aim to secure carbon credits that are high quality, as defined by recognized independent standards and bodies. In addition, we conduct our own due diligence on projects and have established our own investment criteria dependent on project type (1). — Invest in carbon avoidance and removal projects: Our program will support a mix of projects that both avoid new greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere (e.g., avoided deforestation and improved cookstoves) and projects that remove carbon dioxide (e.g., afforestation). — Seek climate solutions with wider co‐benefits: Nature and climate projects should have wider environmental and social benefits wherever possible. For example, in support of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, co‐benefits can be achieved in relation to biodiversity in the local environment and social and economic benefits to local communities. — Invest in both nature and climate tech solutions: Our initial focus will be on nature‐based solutions because of the ability to make impact at scale in the short‐term and co‐benefits, but we are aware of their limitations. As a technology company, with entrepreneurialism as a key value, we will seek opportunities to support the development of new technologies such as direct air capture and storage which are durable and scalable. — Create a balanced carbon credit portfolio: Our portfolio will be made up of both development projects where we are a significant funder, purchase agreements with existing projects and investing through funds. Our investment projects will deliver our long‐term (up to 30 years+) supply of carbon credits. Support for existing projects and solutions (through offtake or spot credits) will ensure that we contribute to impact today. — Ensure we support projects across countries: We will support projects where possible in countries where Capgemini operates, alongside larger project development opportunities across the planet."
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 205 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 — Take action at a fair scale: Our levels of investment will be relevant to our carbon emissions. We will scale up investment each year to the point that retired credits are at the same level as our operational emissions by 2025 and from 2030 include our supply chain related emissions. This is as set out in our ESG Policy. — Ensure transparency: Our strategy will be transparent and aligned to best practice. Our nature and climate solutions approach is aligned with multiple third‐party standards or initiatives, including First Movers Coalition (FMC) with our commitment to contract 50,000 tons by 2030 and planting 20 million trees through 1t.org. 6. Collective Action We are committed to working collaboratively to drive action towards a more sustainable future. This starts with our people alongside our global partnerships and clients. Training and upskilling are key enablers in achieving our targets across our Group and value chain. Our Sustainability Campus launched in 2022 is accessible to all our people and centralizes our sustainability learning, including our Global Awareness Module. In 2024, the Group made the module mandatory to all employees. For our collaboration and actions with clients, please see 4.3.4. 7. Global leadership Capgemini is committed to forming global partnerships around climate action and to openly communicating our vocal support for global decarbonization and the role of technology in enabling this. For example, our membership of the LEAF Coalition – a public‐private partnership focused on halting tropical deforestation by 2030 – and the First Movers Coalition on Carbon Removal, which aims to accelerate the adoption of emerging climate technologies. These new commitments build upon several other initiatives we continue to support. such as Race to Zero, RE100 and EV100. For a full list please refer to Section 4.3.3.3 “Actions contributing to our net zero program” below. 4.3.3.3 Actions contributing to our net zero program a) Energy 1. Sustainable Energy Transition to 100% renewable electricity Through our membership of the RE100, we are committed to supporting the acceleration of renewable electricity, with a target to reach 100% renewable electricity by 2025. We have made strong advances, increasing our share of renewable electricity from 28% in 2019 to 98% in 2024. We have 32 countries now using 100% renewable electricity. Our renewable electricity transition has resulted in a reduction of 137,380 tCO2e since 2019. The transition is being delivered through on‐site solar and power purchase agreements (PPAs) where feasible. Energy attribute certificates are also part of our strategy for sites where energy supplies are controlled by the landlord, or in countries where our consumption is too low for a PPA to be a viable option. Capgemini India, which accounts for more than half of our electricity consumption, continues to be powered by 100% renewable electricity. Over 14,000 MWh was generated by on‐site solar PV in 2024, accounting for 14% of Capgemini India’s total electricity consumption. In addition, our campuses in Bangalore and Hyderabad, as well as both our Chennai offices are generating electricity surpluses, which are being exported to their respective state electricity grids. In 2024, 656 MWh of renewable electricity was exported to the Indian electricity grid from these four sites, powering the equivalent of around 300‐500 Indian households. We continue to focus on ensuring the data centers we use are powered by renewable electricity (including both data centers leased directly by Capgemini and those managed by third‐party suppliers). In 2024, our owned and leased data centers were powered by 100% renewable electricity and third‐party managed data centers by 88% renewable electricity. This year, we also finalized a new global contract to procure Energy Attribute certificates across the Group in line with RE 100 criteria. This will enable more centralized, more efficient management of our renewable energy certificates, as well as ensuring we maintain high quality standards across the Group. 2. Energy Management Energy Command Center Alongside our focus on renewable energy, we are improving the energy efficiency of our operations. The Energy Command Center (ECC) launched in 2022 has helped drive a 29% reduction in energy consumption across our offices in India, with a saving of 25 GWh of electricity in 2024 vs. 2019. A total of 7 facilities across France, Germany, Portugal, Poland and the United Kingdom have been surveyed in 2024 with completed feasibility assessments for ECC implementation. The ECC measures various metrics such as indoor air quality, energy and water intensity, health of critical assets, renewable energy generation, and overall performance across all energy assets. Scalable both geographically and operationally, it will enable us to manage and reduce our energy use across our offices in India and beyond. The Group extended the scope of its Energy Command Center (ECC) in India in partnership with Schneider Electric, from 6 buildings and 8 campuses (operated since 2022) to 23 campuses and more than 66 buildings. In addition, the ECC is now offered as a service, leveraging Capgemini’s and Schneider Electric’s joint expertise in energy optimization to help organizations accelerate their transition towards smarter and more sustainable energy management. We began the implementation of an automated energy data collection and validation tool, integrated with the ECC, to encompass our offices in France, Europe, LatAm, the Americas, and APAC. With India already fully integrated, the system is on track to be implemented and operational by 2025. Battery Energy Storage Solution We continue to make savings from the two state‐of‐the‐art ‘Battery Energy Storage Solutions’ (BESS) installed in our campuses: one with a capacity of 2.5 MWh in the Noida campus and the other a 3.5 MWh capacity in the Mumbai campus. These systems allow Capgemini to store excess renewable energy generated from solar plants during the day and use it during the evening peak hours, significantly reducing pressure on the grid at peak hours, as well as reducing GHG emissions and energy costs. BESS also stores energy from the grid overnight when the carbon intensity is lower. The energy is then discharged during the morning peak when the carbon intensity is higher and there is more pressure on the grid. Across the campuses, 525 Mwh of excess solar energy was stored and used for night operations, saving 376 tCO2e in 2024. These operations are scheduled and monitored by the ECC. Through peak shaving, we used BESS to store 1,417Mwh electricity during non‐peak hours which was then used during peak hours, saving over 27,000 euros and reducing pressure on the electricity grid."
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 206 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Sustainability performance of our offices and data centers Creating sustainable and energy efficient workplaces starts with strong environmental design. Many of our flagship buildings located in India, France, Germany, Poland, Spain, and Sweden are certified under LEED, IGBC, BREEAM or equivalent green building accreditations. Capgemini’s Bangalore, Pune Hnjewadi, Talawade and Mumbai Airoli campuses in India have been awarded the Net Zero-Energy Platinum Certification by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) in recognition of their strong energy performance and use of 100% renewable electricity. The campuses showcase innovative sustainability features including an energy efficient HVAC system with district cooling, solar arrays, rainwater harvesting, electric vehicle charge points and solar‐powered streetlights. Additionally, we have installed a dual feeder electricity supply, which provides a secondary connection from the state utility and therefore reduces our use of diesel generators if one supply experiences an outage. The IGBC “Performance Challenge Award” for continuous improvement was also given to our campuses in Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Noida and Pune Talwade and Hinjewadi campuses, with Capgemini’s Bangalore campus being recognized as one of 100 Iconic Sustainable Buildings by the G20 India Presidency. 3. Green Leases Our green lease framework enables us to apply sustainability criteria when initiating new leases or renewing leases in strategic locations. It covers topics including renewable energy, energy efficiency, EV charging points, and proximity to public transport. In 2024, we updated our Green Lease Framework, transitioning our approach from specific clauses to broader Green Lease Intents. This shift reflects our recognition that clauses often impose one party’s criteria on the other, while intents foster continued collaboration. The aim is a mutually beneficial agreement, with both parties—Capgemini and the asset manager, landlord, broker, or other stakeholders—committing to close collaboration for sustainable outcomes. Our framework includes 16 intents across six key categories: governance, energy & climate, other environmental impact, capital improvements, certifications, and diversity, equity & inclusion. Of these, 12 intents are mandatory for a lease to qualify as a Green Lease. If the mandatory intents are not met, the lease is not considered a Capgemini Green Lease, though we collaborate with landlords to help them achieve full coverage. These intents are closely aligned with our transition roadmap, environmental policy, and Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), ensuring our lease contracts reflect our sustainability commitments. Roles for implementing these intents are clearly defined as part of the lease, enabling both landlords and tenants to track progress effectively at the site level. The primary goal of this new framework is to streamline collaboration and drive continuous improvement. To further support this, in 2024, we expanded our CRES training toolbox, including green lease training to all relevant employees and third‐parties, working in partnership with one of our global brokers to deliver this program. b) Sustainable IT 1. IT energy consumption We continue to monitor and optimize energy of our laptops through our energy management software. The software enables optimized configuration management, which ensures both proactive maintenance and efficiency. As part of ongoing IT infrastructure optimization, we have achieved a 10% reduction in the amount of IT equipment (including servers, networking, communication, laptops, phones and other endpoint equipment) needed in 2024 (against 2023) through the decommissioning of equipment. We have also replaced hardware‐based phones with a software‐based communication solutions, enabling us to decommission over 75,000 phones since 2021. Additionally, we continue to transform our enterprise application portfolio by investing into more modern technologies such as cloud and SaaS platforms. As an outcome of this modernization and rationalization, legacy applications are being retired from the portfolio, reducing the underlying infrastructure footprint, with 16 apps decommissioned in 2024. We continue to consolidate and modernize our data center environments using private cloud platforms and we are increasing our adoption of public cloud services, which typically have lower energy consumption and carbon emissions. 2. IT embedded carbon footprint During 2024, we scaled up our global laptop maintenance and refurbishment program, continuing to work closely with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to extend the functional lifespan of our devices. By keeping laptops in use longer, we reduce our IT carbon footprint and ease the global demand on raw material extraction required for manufacturing new devices (for more on our circularity principles relating to IT hardware see 4.4.2.2). In 2024, around 7,000 laptops were refurbished successfully across the Group, with plans to scale this approach over the next few years. This has led to an estimated saving in Scope 3.1 emissions of 1,000 tonnes of CO2e, through avoiding the purchase of new laptops. Our digital experience tool, a software for endpoint devices that allows optimized configuration management, has enabled us to anticipate laptop failures and proactively address potential issues. We have replaced approximately 28,000 end‐of‐usable‐life desktops and monitors with laptops over the last two years (from 2021 to 2023) and reduced the number of operational desktops by approximately 3,000 in 2024. 3. Sustainable IT tools and talent To support our sustainable-IT transformation journey, we have launched several talent engagement initiatives. Building on our previous initiatives of engaging employees through a series of on‐site gamified interaction events on sustainable-IT topics to raise awareness and encourage sustainable behaviors, we rolled out our sustainable-IT quiz in 2024 with over 600 participants. We also continue to enable Group IT employees to upskill through the development of sustainability learning pathways. For promoting awareness on sustainable-IT topics, in 2024 knowledge posts were published to Group IT employees on our community portal, which are viewed by more than 35% Group IT employees on an average. In 2023, Group IT organized a Sustainable-IT-by‐design masterclass to promote adoption of eco‐design best practices into IT projects and initiatives. We have previously launched our annual data clean‐up campaign to promote sustainable digital usage behavior and knowledge among employees across the Group. In 2024, we also developed our sustainable-IT operations KPI dashboard to better monitor performance of initiatives across practices."
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 207 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4. Enabling digital collaboration We have continued to extend investments to support a hybrid work culture, upgrading office spaces with AV technologies. This enables employees to connect and collaborate globally and contribute to a reduction in our commuting related footprint. During 2024, we upgraded 808 enhanced and premium meeting rooms with wireless presentation systems, improving the meeting room experience for employees, clients and suppliers. This includes the revamp of 282 enhanced meeting rooms with new, energy‐efficient AV equipment. Additionally, 413 standard meeting rooms were upgraded to support video, enhancing hybrid work environments. We also upgraded to the latest Microsoft Teams app, decom­ missioning legacy Skype and Teams apps and moving all employees globally to the same communication app. Our future actions will focus on building upon and advancing the four main thematic initiatives outlined above. This includes: — continuing to progress on our five‐year road map to rationalize our application landscape and ensure legacy applications are decommissioned, thereby reducing our energy consumption and carbon emissions; — continuing to transition from on‐premises to move to energy efficient cloud‐based infrastructure, delivering energy savings and carbon emission reductions; — continuing to work with original equipment manufacturers and their value chain on the repair and refurbishment of laptops, reducing our Scope 3.1 emissions from hardware. c) Travel & Smart Delivery 1. Business Travel We have started to see business travel emissions reduce once again (down 3.6% per employee vs. 2023). Overall, our overall business travel emissions are 51% lower than they were in 2019, resulting in an absolute reduction of 173,547 tCO2e since then. This reflects the enduring shift to hybrid working and virtual collaboration with clients, following the Covid pandemic. During 2024, we continued to invest in IT solutions and equipment to support hybrid working and virtual collaboration, enabling our people to work from anywhere at any time. In 2024, we developed our travel dashboards across our global sustainability network, enabling the better tracking of travel emissions and more granular analysis of air travel in particular. These dashboards provide faster access to information about the progress of each country against our targets, as well as enabling tracking across different business units and different travel modes. They also provide very detailed insights such as the most frequent flight routes for different employee grades. 2. Transitioning to an electric vehicle fleet Our membership of the EV100 commits us to transitioning our car fleet to 100% electric vehicles by 2030. We no longer allow employees to order pure petrol and diesel cars, and last year we introduced a cap of 50 gCO2/km for new hybrid car orders. Capgemini has committed to transitioning its entire 12,000‐vehicle fleet to hybrid and electric vehicles by 2030, with Belgium for example already ordering a fully electric fleet. In 2024, the share of pure EVs was 26% and 71% when including plug‐in hybrids. We have over 2,600 electric vehicle (EV) charge points in place around the Group, providing our employees with charging for their vehicles. Our next step, from 2025, will be to phase out plug‐in hybrid vehicles, where practical. 3. Reducing the impacts of employee commuting In 2024, we conducted our sixth global commuting survey to understand our employees’ commuting habits, as well as the impacts of home working, including the emissions associated with heating, cooling, and powering IT equipment. In total, we had 81,000 people (a quarter of our workforce) respond to our employee commuting survey in 2024. The results have shown an 10% increase in commuting emissions per employee since 2023 due to continued return to working from the office following the Covid pandemic. Overall, though, the shift to hybrid working continues to hold emissions at below pre‐pandemic levels, with commuting emissions per employee down by 49% vs. 2019 (or by 36% vs. 2019 when the impact of working from home is included). In 2024, we have reduced our employee commuting emissions (including working from home) by 60,084 tCO2e in absolute terms since 2019. We will continue to conduct our annual commuting survey to build a comprehensive picture on how our people commute and work from home. This will enable us to continue to build our knowledge and define policies that will keep us on track to our targets. Key actions to support employees to tackle commuting and work from home impacts: — Mobility packages – There are a range of country‐specific mobility packages available to employees. These include very comprehensive mobility arrangements in Germany and Netherlands, which enable employees to use public transport even for their private travel, as well as subsidized or heavily discounted public transport in Italy, Spain and France; — Bicycles and e‐bicycles – Across France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom, a range of support measures are in place to encourage uptake of bikes and e‐bikes, including financial help with buying or loaning a bike (UK, Netherlands, France and Portugal). In Germany, cycling clubs are offered, as well as cycle workshops to provide assistance with repairs. We currently offer bike leasing through localized approaches. Moving forward, we plan to review the program with a more holistic and global perspective, aligning it with employee preferences and ensuring it remains accessible and effective across all regions; and — Home Energy – In the United Kingdom, a series of webinars were held in partnership with the Big Clean Switch to advise employees on improving energy efficiency at home, with around 4,000 of our people attending. Employees are also supported through the provision of access to home energy assessments, to help them identify how they can improve the energy efficiency of their home. We also offer interest‐free loans for employees who would like to move forward with the recommendations from these assessments;"

In India, we plan to transition to buses powered by bio‐compressed natural gas to reduce our commuting emissions; and — Car share – Across several regions we are planning, or already have in place, ride sharing and carpooling initiatives to reduce emissions. d) Supply Chain 1. Engaging with our suppliers Working with our suppliers is pivotal in advancing our environmental strategy. Supplier engagement continued in 2024 with our supplier day and CPO roundtable events providing platforms for discussing target setting, emissions data capture and low‐carbon pathways. We continue to be recognized by CDP for our efforts to engage with our suppliers on the topic of climate change, achieving a place on CDP’s 2023 Supplier Engagement Leaderboard. In 2025, we intend to collaborate and support suppliers even further by creating training material aligned with the contents of the ESG Pledge and sustainable procurement Policy. This will allow suppliers to improve their knowledge base and have access to tools that will enable them to improve their actions no matter where they are on their own environmental journey. We have also started to integrate environmental criteria into our supplier selection for our main categories (IT Hardware, IT Network and Facility Management). In 2025, we are planning to continue this roll‐out as well as produce material for our suppliers, including basic starter knowledge as well as concrete uses cases to reduce carbon emissions. 2. ESG Pledge In 2024, we continued to roll out our Supply Chain ESG Pledge launched last year, aiming to build strong supplier engagement towards supporting the achievement of Capgemini’s carbon reduction goals. The ESG Pledge requires suppliers to disclose their annual GHG emissions, set science‐based targets validated by SBTi, and share their climate transition and low‐carbon product strategies. By the end of 2024, suppliers representing 35% of our total spend had agreed to commit to the ESG Pledge or are aligned to its principles. Any other actions taken or planned by suppliers are encouraged and can be formalized as voluntary contributions to be committed to within the pledge. Going forward, we plan to make our ESG Pledge more inclusive by extending beyond carbon to encompass critical areas, such as biodiversity, water‐related topics, and addressing broader nature‐focused concerns. This pledge will also integrate wider sustainability objectives and social aspects, fostering a more comprehensive approach to environmental, social, and governance priorities. 3. CDP supply chain membership Our CDP supply chain membership helps us to support our suppliers in calculating their emissions and advancing their climate change understanding. This collaboration has improved the accuracy of our Scope 3 data but also enhanced our insight into the challenges and progress of our suppliers towards net zero. In 2024, the 184 suppliers who responded to our CDP request demonstrated they had already made progress in tackling climate change; around 49% have set science‐based targets, with 56% having a climate transition plan aligned with 1.5C. 4. Embedding sustainability training To ensure a cohesive approach to our net zero goal, it is essential to raise awareness among employees about the environmental implications of their procurement decisions. In 2024, we continued to provide sustainability and carbon accounting training to targeted procurement teams in high emission purchasing categories. We have also redeveloped the set of training available to procurement professionals. This training embeds fundamental knowledge on ESG challenges and concrete actions, as well as best practices that can be deployed with suppliers for carbon emissions reductions. 5. Supplier assessment via an ESG assessment tool and during procurement sourcing process: Capgemini is currently deploying a dedicated ESG assessment platform, which will be fully operational in 2025 (see Section 4.11.7 for more details). This will enable Group Procurement to assess suppliers’ maturity on a range of environmental topics and identify risks within our supply chain. Following risk identification, Capgemini can discuss action plans with suppliers to improve their compliance and business resilience. The four main environmental risk areas categorized within our supplier assessment are pollution, waste, substances of concern and GHG emissions. In 2025, we will also continue refining and adapting our procurement processes to make sure environmental criteria are fully embedded and taking a bigger weight into our sourcing processes. Our future actions will focus on building upon and advancing the five main thematic initiatives outlined above. Beyond the Procurement‐specific pillars above, our Group Procurement team is actively collaborating with Group IT and Group CRES teams on key cross‐functional initiatives. Together, they are delivering an IT refurbishment program aimed at extending the lifespan of current laptops, thereby reducing the need for new purchases and promoting sustainable technology practices. Additionally, the teams are driving circularity in office furniture by identifying opportunities to procure refurbished items or refurbish existing furniture, reinforcing a commitment to sustainable resource use wherever possible (please refer to Section 4.4.2.2 “Actions and initiatives on key purchasing categories” for more details). Group Procurement will also work cross‐functionally with Group IT to enhance supplier engagement and demand management around cloud services. e) Nature and Climate Solutions 1. Collaborating with others for greater impact We are committed to working with others to drive growth in the development of nature and climate tech solutions. We are members of the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, a public‐private partnership with the goal to halt deforestation by financing large scale tropical forest protection at jurisdiction level (country/state) and last year we were one of the first buyers of high integrity forest carbon credits, in a national deal with Ghana and with the State of Para in Brazil. We have also invested in funds including the Mirova Climate Fund for Nature. This fund launched in 2023 with a number of corporate members and currently exceeds €195m euros. It is expected to grow and is targeting projects dedicated to protecting and restoring nature in emerging markets, as well as supporting farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture."
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 209 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 In 2023, we joined the First Movers Coalition for carbon removal, committing to contract at least 50,000 tons or $25m of durable and scalable carbon dioxide removals by the end of 2030. To date we have contracted 39,500 tons to be delivered over the coming years from the following suppliers: Neustark – 10,000 tons Neustark is a Switzerland‐based specialist leader of high‐quality durable carbon removals, which Capgemini has entered into a long‐term offtake agreement to remove 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide. Neustark’s innovative technology and business model captures CO2 from biomass sites, liquefies it, then injects it into existing mineral waste streams such as demolished materials to be recycled and used in construction. This utilizes a process of mineralization that stores the CO2 in the aggregate, permanently removing it from the atmosphere. Neustark’s projects are currently certified under the Gold Standard to ensure credible third‐party assessment and transparency related to performance. Building on its existing 19 sites in Europe, the business plans to bring online approximately 40 additional sites throughout 2025 in the region. Neustark is scaling up rapidly, on track towards its ambition of permanently removing one million tons of CO2 in 2030. Charm Industrial – 16,500 tons Capgemini has entered into a long‐term offtake agreement with Charm Industrial, based in the US, to permanently remove 16,500 tons of carbon dioxide. Charm Industrial converts biomass residues after harvest (for example, corn stover, forestry residues) into bio‐oil by heating the biomass quickly to very high temperatures. Charm uses woody or cellulosic residues in their pyrolysis and ensures that any emissions associated with growth or harvesting of this biomass are accounted for. This means waste biomass that would have otherwise decomposed is a preferred feedstock. The resulting bio‐oil is low in energy content, but high in carbon content, and can be transported and injected underground into geological storage reservoirs such as depleted oil & gas reservoirs, saline aquifers and salt caverns regulated by the US EPA. It is a highly viscous liquid which is denser than the surrounding formation fluid, and so will sink in the reservoir and risk of buoyancy/upward migration is low. The bio‐oil polymerizes (solidifies) on an expected timescale between 2–20 years, rendering it effectively immobile within the subsurface and therefore durable on geological timescales. This removes CO2 permanently from the atmosphere, out of reach of wildfires, soil erosion and land use change. Climeworks – 13,000 tons Climeworks is a global leader in carbon removal and Capgemini has entered into a long‐term offtake agreement to permanently remove 13,000 tons of carbon dioxide through their direct air capture technology. Direct air capture (DAC) is a technology that captures CO2 directly from the air. Unlike traditional carbon capture methods focused on industrial emissions at the source, DAC offers a versatile solution for carbon removal by capturing CO2 from the air which is then combined with permanent underground storage. Climeworks already operates two Direct Air Capture plants in Iceland and delivers third‐party certified carbon removal services to its customers. In the USA, Climeworks announced three projects as part of the U.S. Department of Energy’s Regional DAC Hubs program kickstarting the first hub, Project Cypress. Other promising locations are Canada, Norway, and Kenya. 2. Mitigating emissions beyond our value chain Since 2019, we have reduced our operational emissions by 47%. Alongside this decarbonization, we have continued to scale up our climate contribution. Carbon credit projects In 2024, we retired 314,312 carbon credits from 11 projects, which equates to 72% of our remaining operational emissions. Details of credits retired can be found in Section 4.3.3.5 “Metrics related to our net zero program” below. Together with our suppliers, we perform due diligence on each carbon credit project from which we have retired credits. Since the release of the IC-VCMs Core Carbon Principles (CCP), we have been aligning our evaluation framework to ensure overlap with all ten principles. This includes considering governance of the carbon credit standards to ensure it is effective, operates a registry where credits can be tracked and where information on projects is transparent, and validation and verification is undertaken by independent third-parties. All the carbon credits retired come from CCP eligible programs (VCS, Gold Standard and CAR). At a project level we evaluate additionally, permanence, quantification, ensure no double counting and look for projects that contribute to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, have appropriate safeguarding mechanisms and contribute to the net zero transition. The voluntary carbon market has been and should continue to be in a state of renewal, learning and improving the robustness of processes, assessment and quantification. Our due diligence process does not imply credits retired will receive a CCP label from IC-VCM given how methodologies and the market have had to evolve, but they represent credits from projects that passed our interpretation of these principles at the time of purchase. Going forward our due diligence process will continue to evolve for new investments and purchases to evaluate using best practice in line with our values and principles. As requirements and standards continue to evolve, we will always endeavor to ensure we are following the latest guidelines. There will however always be a lag between commitments made to pre-existing projects, the speed which projects can adapt to methodological changes, new purchases and investments and credits we have available to retire. All credits, if applicable, may be counted towards the host countries achievement of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement. 1 trillion trees campaign (1t.org) Capgemini is part of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 1 trillion trees campaign to conserve, restore, and grow one trillion trees around the world by 2030. We have committed to planting 20 million trees by 2030 and as of the end of 2024 we had planted around 17 million trees. Whilst the majority of this progress is being made through our carbon credit program, we have also established other tree planting initiatives including the Capgemini Forest. Through our partner Ecologi, a B-Corp climate action platform focused on tree planting around the world, the Capgemini Forest has now reached over 1 million trees planted across 16 countries. We will continue to source nature and climate solutions in line with our targets to retire credits equivalent to our operational emissions in 2025, adding our supply chain in 2030 and reaching Net Zero in 2040."

Capgemini has set a headline Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) validated net zero target, which is to achieve 90% absolute reduction across our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2040, against a 2019 baseline. This means reducing our total 2019 emissions from 1.13 million tons of CO2e to around 113,000 tons of CO2e by 2040, which equates to an absolute reduction of 1.02 million tons of CO2e. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined accounted for 14% of our emissions in the baseline year, and our combined Scope 1 and 2 target will see these emissions reduce by 90% from 154,078 tons of CO2e in 2019 to 15,408 tons of CO2e in 2040, an absolute reduction of 138,670 tons of CO2e. Our total Scope 3 emissions were 977,472 tons of CO2e in 2019 and according to our SBTi target will reduce to 97,747 tons of CO2e in 2040, a reduction of 879,725 tons of CO2e. In order to achieve our target and ensure we are on track, we have set several near‐term emissions reduction targets: — an absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 80% by 2030; — a reduction of Scope 3 business travel emissions by 55% per employee by 2030; — a reduction of Scope 3 commuting emissions by 55% per employee by 2030; and — an absolute reduction in Scope 3 purchased goods and services emissions by 50% by 2030. In addition, we have set two supporting targets, which also contribute towards our emissions reduction strategy: — transitioning to 100% renewable electricity by 2025 (as part of our RE100 commitment); and — transitioning our company fleet to 100% electric vehicles by 2030 (as part of our EV 100 commitment)."

Capgemini has set a headline Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) validated net zero target, which is to achieve 90% absolute reduction across our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2040, against a 2019 baseline. This means reducing our total 2019 emissions from 1.13 million tons of CO2e to around 113,000 tons of CO2e by 2040, which equates to an absolute reduction of 1.02 million tons of CO2e. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined accounted for 14% of our emissions in the baseline year, and our combined Scope 1 and 2 target will see these emissions reduce by 90% from 154,078 tons of CO2e in 2019 to 15,408 tons of CO2e in 2040, an absolute reduction of 138,670 tons of CO2e. Our total Scope 3 emissions were 977,472 tons of CO2e in 2019 and according to our SBTi target will reduce to 97,747 tons of CO2e in 2040, a reduction of 879,725 tons of CO2e. In order to achieve our target and ensure we are on track, we have set several near‐term emissions reduction targets: — an absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 80% by 2030; — a reduction of Scope 3 business travel emissions by 55% per employee by 2030; — a reduction of Scope 3 commuting emissions by 55% per employee by 2030; and — an absolute reduction in Scope 3 purchased goods and services emissions by 50% by 2030. In addition, we have set two supporting targets, which also contribute towards our emissions reduction strategy: — transitioning to 100% renewable electricity by 2025 (as part of our RE100 commitment); and — transitioning our company fleet to 100% electric vehicles by 2030 (as part of our EV 100 commitment)."
"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 212 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2019 has been chosen as a baseline year for all targets as it represents a typical operating year prior to the impacts of the Covid pandemic and is representative in terms of business areas and activities covered by Capgemini. It is also the year in which Capgemini finalized its acquisition of Altran, significantly expanding its engineering and R&D capabilities and growing the Capgemini Group headcount by over 47,000 people. Due to the transformative nature of this acquisition, it is not meaningful to report in detail on progress prior to 2019. It is perhaps worth noting that Capgemini was in 2016 one of the first in its sector to set science‐based targets approved by SBTi: Capgemini’s headline target of a GHG emission reduction of 30% per employee (vs 2015) was met in January 2020, before the Covid lockdowns came into effect. We continue to accelerate our carbon reduction program across our largest climate‐related impact areas. Looking at our footprint across our value chain, we know our biggest carbon impacts result from the the goods and services we procure, our commuting and business‐related travel as well as the energy use in our facilities. Our near‐term 2030 targets tackle all these areas, covering 98% of our total GHG emissions in both the baseline year and 2024. Our net zero 2040 target covers 100% of our total GHG emissions. In 2024, Capgemini made significant strides towards achieving its targets. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 93% reduction (vs 2019) primarily driven by our transition to 98% renewable electricity globally. Notably, 32 countries within our operations now run on 100% renewable energy, with over 14,000 MWh of solar power generated on-site. This progress has been supported by our innovative energy-saving initiatives such as our Energy Command Center in India, which has helped reduce global office energy consumption by 42% since 2019. Our commitment to reducing Scope 3 emissions, which represent a larger challenge, also saw advancements. In 2024, business travel emissions remained 51% lower than pre-pandemic levels and our hybrid working policies continue to keep commuting emissions per employee 49% lower than in 2019. Collaborations with suppliers are also central to our approach, as 41% of our emissions stem from purchased goods and services. Through our supplier engagement workshops and ESG Pledge, we have gained commitments from suppliers representing 35% of our spend to align with the ESG pledge. Water conservation is another area where we saw marked improvements, with total water withdrawal down 50% from 2019. Initiatives like rainwater harvesting and advanced sewage treatment facilities across our campuses have been pivotal, particularly in water-stressed regions such as India. Waste reduction and circularity are core to our environmental strategy. We reduced waste per employee by 56% compared to 2019, and our Global Zero Waste Standard is ensuring we minimize waste and embed circularity throughout our operations. Overall, in 2024, we have reduced our total GHG emissions by 393,251 tCO2e in absolute terms since 2019, corresponding to a 35% reduction. Alongside our target to reduce our absolute carbon emissions by 90% across all scopes by 2040, we have also made a commitment to scaling up our contribution to climate and nature solutions. We currently invest in projects that will generate high-quality carbon credits (as defined by independent standards) that have a positive impact for the planet and deliver wider social and environmental co-benefits. We continue to reduce our negative impacts and maximize positive actions in other areas, including water and waste, promoting circularity and biodiversity initiatives (please refer to Sections 4.4 “Circular economy and resources” and 4.5 “Other environmental topics” below for further information). We have defined our net zero target in line with SBTi’s Corporate Net-Zero Standard methodology, which requires that companies commit to reaching net zero by 2050. SBTi validation demonstrates the alignment of our targets with the Paris Agreement and with global efforts to limit the global temperature increases to within 1.5 degrees Celsius versus pre-industrial levels. Setting a target to reach net zero by 2040, 10 years ahead of the timeline recommended by SBTi and the Paris Agreement, is ambitious and will hopefully encourage others within our value chain (clients and suppliers) to follow our lead and make equally ambitious commitments. This target aligns with international policy goals, in particular the 2015 Paris Agreement. It covers all our greenhouse gas emissions (which are measured in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard and aggregated in tonnes of CO2e) including Carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as any Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) which are primarily used in our air conditioning and refrigerant systems. Our climate targets have been defined through consultation and collaboration with key internal functions (Sustainability, Real Estate, Procurement, Group IT), as well as key Capgemini country and region leads. The targets were ultimately approved by our Net Zero Board including our Group CEO and Board of Directors, before being validated by the SBTi. We have not made any changes to our targets during the reporting period. Minor changes have been made to the emissions calculation methodology and emissions data for historic years, which are provided in more detail in Section 4.3.3.5 b) “GHG emissions and performance”. Progress against most of our targets is reviewed on a quarterly basis by our Net Zero Board, as well as our Cross-Function Committee and Group Sustainability networks. The Board of Directors is updated regularly on our progress against the targets. We also forecast both our year‐end position (to help with short‐term planning) and a long‐term view of how we expect our progress against the targets to evolve over the next few years. Our progress against meeting our target before 2024 is discussed in more detail in Section 4.3.3.1. “Our road to Net Zero: strategy and transition”. Our description of our decarbonization levers and their overall quantitative contributions to achieve GHG emission reduction target can be found across Sections 4.3.3.1 “Our road to Net Zero: strategy and transition” and 4.3.3.3 “Actions contributing to our net zero program of this Sustainability Statement”."

"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 215 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 b) GHG emissions and performance Our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are calculated following the methodology outlined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Reporting and Accounting Standard, using an operational control approach. For the majority of GHG emissions sources (energy usage, business travel, F-gas, waste and water) is collected monthly or quarterly from 42 countries. Data on commuting and working from home is mostly gathered annually through the implementation of a global survey, with some supplementary data sets considered where available. Data on our purchased goods and services is gathered annually in collaboration with the Group Procurement team, utilizing a combination of spend data and supplier or product specific data. GHG emissions for Scope 1 energy and F-gas, Scope 3 travel and commuting and Scope 3 waste are calculated using the emission factors recommended by the United Kingdom Government’s Emission Factors. GHG emissions for category 3.1 Purchased Goods and Services are calculated in part using spend-based emission factors sourced from Exiobase, US EPA and the UK Government. For two specific categories, professional services and external resources, we have developed bespoke emission factors based on internal Capgemini data, as we found that our external contractors’ emissions profiles are closer to the Capgemini average than the spend-based factors. In addition, we use product‐specific carbon footprint data from equipment manufacturers for hardware related emissions, as well as supplier‐specific data provided through the CDP supply chain program for some of our key suppliers. For Scope 3.1 emissions associated with third party data centers, we work with suppliers to gather real data on energy and fuel consumption and utilize emission factors from the UK Government’s Emission Factors, as well as supplier‐specific emission factors for electricity consumption. Emissions from co-working spaces are included in category 3.1 Purchased Goods and Services. For Scope 2 electricity, as per the GHG Protocol, we calculate emissions in two ways, using both the market-based and the location-based approach. The greenhouse gas emission data that we present throughout this report are aggregated on the basis of market-based emissions approach, which is also the main approach used to calculate progress against targets. Location-based emissions are provided only in the table in this Section. — For Scope 2 market-based emissions we have assumed an emission factor of 0 for electricity purchased on renewable PPAs and/or backed up by renewable energy attribute certificates. Where renewable electricity is not in place, we have used a residual fuel mix factor, sourced for from RE-DISS for countries in Europe. In locations where neither supplier- based nor residual fuel mix factors are available, we have used a location-based emission factor. For Scope 2 emissions associated with purchased heat or cooling, we have used supplier‐specific emission factors where available, and UK Government’s Emission Factors where not available. — For the location-based approach, regional electricity emission factors have been applied for India (Central Electricity Authority), the UK (BEIS), Australia (NGA), Canada (Canada National Inventory), China (China National Bureau of Statistics), and the US (eGrid). For all the other countries, emission factors from International Energy Agency (IEA) have been applied to calculate Scope 2 location-based emissions. Where possible, we gather actual data – such as kWh from digital metering systems or invoices and mileage data from travel agents and expense systems. Data is estimated in the following cases: — when actual data has been delayed beyond the reporting deadline – this data in this report is finalized by early January 2025, by which point not all invoices and expenses are submitted so data is estimated for missing months; — when a small entity does not have the resources available to collect the data – we report data on 99.8% of operations by headcount, the remaining proportion is in smaller entities, typically where there are less than 250 employees. In these countries, data is estimated based on the Group average – with the estimation adjusted in proportion to the floor area/ headcount; — in leased buildings we sometimes do not have the necessary access to invoices and plant infrastructure to gather actual data – in many cases landlords and building owners do provide actual data anyway, but in some cases, we use estimations to fill data gaps; — when we are a tenant of a shared facility with no sub-metering or tenant-specific data – in this case data is allocated based on floor area or number of employees; and — a percentage of employees do not book their travel through the approved travel agency – to account for these cases we extrapolate the data by applying a percentage uplift to the travel agency data. The calculation of the emissions associated with employee commuting and working from home are based on the commuting survey results from 2024. The responses of over 81,000 employees (24% of our headcount), provided insight into the distance employees travelled for each mode of transport, the frequency of commuting versus working from home and the energy consumption and main sources of emissions whilst working from home (including from heating, cooling and IT equipment). For each country, the average commuting emissions and working from home emissions per employee have been calculated which we extrapolated on a country basis to reflect the total number of employees. A small number of countries did not have a big enough population size or survey response rate to constitute a statistically significant sample, and therefore in these cases the data was extrapolated using the Group average."

"2024 Sustainability Statement Part II – Environmental information E1 – Climate change 217 2024 Universal Registration Document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 There have been no significant acquisitions, mergers or other major changes to the business that have required the recalculation of GHG emissions for previous years. There have been minor changes to emissions reported for previous years for the following reasons: — two new countries (Egypt and Slovakia) have been onboarded on the carbon accounting system with previously estimated data replaced with actuals; — some data centers leased by Capgemini are being managed by a third party now. Therefore, their emissions have moved from Scope 1 & 2 to Scope 3 for all years; and — we have received updated information for some countries and corrected minor errors. To ensure year on year comparability, data for all years has been updated where relevant to do so. These changes to historic data are not significant at a Group level, accounting for 0.02% change in total GHG emissions for 2019 and 0.24% change in total GHG emissions for 2023 emissions. However, they are significant at a country or emission source level and therefore have been implemented to ensure year‐on‐year comparability of granular data. Scope 1 emissions relate to direct emissions from buildings or assets – for Capgemini this includes fuel consumption and fluorinated gas (F-gas) used in air conditioning units of the offices and data centers under the Company’s operational control. Scope 2 emissions include emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity, heat, or cooling. The reduction in our Scope 2 emissions against the baseline year is the result of a significant increase in the use of renewable electricity. Scope 3 emissions are indirect greenhouse gas emissions (not included in scope 2) that occur in the value chain. We have assessed the relevance of all GHG Protocol Scope 3 categories and determined that relevant emission categories include 3.1 purchased goods and services, 3.3 fuel and energy-related activities (not included in scope 1 or scope 2) – for Capgemini in particular electricity transmission and distribution losses, 3.5 waste management, 3.6 business travel, 3.7 employee commuting (including working from home). Category 3.1 also includes a small portion of emissions associated with 3.2 capital goods and 3.4 upstream transportation and distribution as there is not always a satisfactory way of separating these emissions. Other Scope 3 categories have been evaluated according to the GHG Protocol criteria, focusing particularly on the size of emissions, the level of stakeholder interest and our ability to influence these emissions, and have been determined as not relevant. Over the last few years, Capgemini has transitioned from having a majority of leased data centers to having a majority of third party managed data centers which are now reported under scope 3.1 emissions, but as a separate line for full transparency. As recommended by the GHG Protocol, emissions of F-gas not covered by the Kyoto Protocol such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are not reported as Scope 1 emissions and are therefore not included above. These F-gas emissions are, however, captured with a value of 258 tons of CO2e for 2024. Our business travel emissions have been calculated including the impact of radiative forcing for air travel and we have also accounted for hotel emissions. We also include company cars within the business travel category, as they are not owned or leased directly by Capgemini but by employees. Not all companies in our sector take this approach so direct comparisons should be made with appropriate awareness and caution. For Belgium and Luxembourg, car emissions have been excluded from commute as they are already accounted for under business travel. Emissions from employee commuting have increased in 2024 as more employees are working from the office (especially in India, which accounts for more than half of the headcount). The total GHG emissions per unit revenue has been calculated by dividing the total GHG emissions (market‐based) by the total revenue. The revenue figures can be found in Chapter 5 “Financial Information” of the 2024 Universal Registration Document.

"Addressing our financial opportunity: initiating deposit return and recycling schemes (E5-2) By promoting industry-driven non-profit deposit return schemes (DRSs), we can create a higher level of resilience in our packaging value chain. High return rates can reduce the risk of environmental fees on our packaging and maintain the high value of clean mono-materials in a closed recycling loop for beer and beverage packaging. This creation of circular material flows also contributes to a future-proofed business model in a world with increasing material scarcity. As our DMA indicated, recycling and DRSs represent a material financial opportunity for our business. As they are also a key lever for reaching our ZERO Packaging Waste goals, facilitating their creation and development in markets around the world is one of our priorities. We have, for many years, been active in developing recycling and DRSs in many of our markets, with significant improvements in return rates for bottles and cans achieved in all four Nordic and all three Baltic countries. We are exploring expanding these efforts in regions with low recycling rates, such as Asia and Central & Eastern Europe, and supporting the continued implementation across Western Europe. In 2024, we finalised a position paper advocating for DRSs as the optimal separate collection system for beverage packaging, based on research and experience across our markets. We also hosted a workshop in Latvia for our European markets and local representatives from the DRS scheme in Latvia to exchange best practice and tools for implementation. Improving existing DRSs and supporting the roll-out of effective DRSs in more markets will increase our collection rate, helping us to reach our 2030 target and meet our policy commitment to play an active role in improving and building beverage packaging systems with less environmental impact.

Net zero ó We commit to reach net-zero GHG emissions across our value chain by 20503. Timeline Target 1. Committed, but not yet approved by the SBTi, the target is based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 2. Ahold Delhaize has also committed to set long-term scope 3 emissions reduction and net-zero targets by 2050. These targets are submitted, but not yet validated by the SBTi. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 3. In the setting of our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are planning to also make use of removals to the extent permitted by the SBTi guidance. In 2023, in line with the SBTi guidance on land-related (forest, land and agriculture sector or FLAG) and non-land-related (Energy and Industrial sector or E&I), we replaced both our near-term and long-term scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets with two reduction targets, FLAG and E&I sector targets. Both our near-term (2030) and our long-term (2050) scope 3 reduction targets are consistent with the SBTi methodology with the aim of maintaining the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase within 1.5°C of pre- industrial temperatures. The estimated FLAG emissions make up 42% our total GHG footprint in 2024. In setting the target, we applied the SBTi FLAG Standard with a linear annual reduction of 3.03%. For the E&I sector emissions target, we consider the SBTi's 4.2% annual reduction. We submitted the scope 3 targets to the SBTi in October 2023 and they are pending validation. Conversations and responses to queries from the SBTi on our submitted scope 3 targets are ongoing. We continue to use 2020 as our baseline year for scope 3, consistent with the prior submissions, given the improved quality and robustness of our local brands’ data for that year. The near-term (2030) reduction targets cover 67% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories, while the long-term (2050) reduction targets cover 90% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more details on the calculation. For setting our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are making use of removals to the extent permitted by the applicable SBTi guidance. As a general rule, the use of carbon credits must not be counted as emissions reduction toward the progress of a company’s near-term science-based targets. Carbon credits may only be considered an option for neutralizing residual emissions or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond the science-based emissions reduction targets. We follow this principle in our target setting. See GHG removals and carbon credits for more details on our approach to carbon credits. Avoided emissions fall under a separate accounting system from corporate inventories and do not count toward science-based targets. Metrics We are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol, which defines a global standardized framework for the measurement and management of GHG emissions from the private and public sectors. Our carbon footprint methodology follows the guidelines of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/WRI and we report our GHG emissions data with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our methodology, estimates and judgments around the metrics used are included in Sustainability notes.

Compared to the 2018 restated baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e Compared to our 2018 baseline, GHG emissions decreased by 36% in 2024. The main driver for the higher reduction percentage compared to last year was our reduction in emissions coming from refrigerants, demonstrating that our investments in cleaner refrigerants are paying off. GHG emissions from refrigerant leakages remained our largest source of emissions. In 2024, these emissions totaled 1,199 kilotonnes, compared to 1,323 kilotonnes in 2023. In 2024, we saw a slight decrease in our leak rate. Furthermore, because we replaced high-GWP refrigerants with low-GWP and natural refrigerants, the average GWP of these leakages decreased. Refrigerant emissions per square meter of sales area were 144 kilograms CO2e compared to 153 kilograms CO2e last year.

"climate Climate and nature can be seen as two sides of the same coin. Climate change is a key driver of nature loss, while the degradation of nature contributes to climate change and undermines nature’s ability to regulate emissions and adapt to weather events. Our climate pillar includes the material sustainability matter climate change, which covers both our impact on climate change (mainly due to GHG emissions), including the impact on nature, and the impact of climate change on our organization (mainly physical and transition risks). In the Nature section of this report, we will focus on drivers of nature loss other than climate change. climate change Definition: Understanding and mitigating business impacts on climate change by reducing scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions across the value chain. This includes our approach to mitigating and adapting to climate-related risks and the implications for our business, including physical and transition risks, as well as the identification of climate- related opportunities in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The climate change material matter includes two sub-topics: climate change mitigation and energy and climate adaptation. Governance See General information: Governance in the sustainability statements for more information on the governance of sustainability. Our approach to climate change is rolled out globally, with our brand leadership teams responsible for implementing actions within the brands. Every brand has dedicated teams working to reduce its climate impact from own operations and the value chain. These teams consist of associates from departments such as Store Development and Store Maintenance, as well as sourcing managers. Because decarbonizing our business is such a high priority, we linked the achievement of our scope 1 and 2 GHG-emissions reduction targets to remuneration under our long-term, share-based incentive plan. In 2024, we further strengthened the connection between executive compensation and sustainability by updating our annual cash incentive plan to include, in the performance measures, having a detailed and approved scope 3 plan. We continue to keep our sustainability targets, ambitions and objectives, and their interrelation, including our GHG-emissions reduction targets, under review to ensure alignment with our overall strategy.

"Strategy As food retailers, we are aware of how climate change is impacting the way food is grown and will change our business, both now and in the years to come – from how and where products are sourced to what our brands’ stores look like and how we heat or cool them. A healthy planet is a key component of our Healthy communities & planet strategic priority, and our approach to addressing climate change in our Company focuses on both the impact of climate change on our business and how our business activities impact the climate. We aim to reduce our impact on the climate through our commitment to reach net-zero GHG emissions across our own operations by 2040 (scope 1 and 2) and become a net-zero business across the entire value chain, products and services no later than 2050 (scope 3). For more information on our strategy and how it is linked to the material sustainability matters we have identified, see Our material sustainability matters section. Transition plan Our impact and overall approach Climate change and the degradation of nature are global threats to the health of the planet and people’s lives and livelihoods. A range of issues – such as energy production, deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, agriculture and waste – contribute to the climate crisis and to the health and resilience of the planet, which underpins the well-being of everyone who inhabits it. Through our activities, we are producing direct and indirect GHG emissions. This means we are impacting climate change in different ways. Examples range from the fossil fuels burned for heating and during transportation, the electricity consumed throughout our facilities or the refrigerants we use for cooling the products in our stores, to the way the products we source are produced, their usage by our brands’ customers or how the waste is treated. Of our total carbon footprint, refrigerants, electricity, heating and transport form our scope 1 and 2 footprint. The remaining emissions categories form our scope 3 footprint, representing around 96% of our total direct and indirect carbon footprint in 2024. See also Sustainability notes for a further breakdown of our GHG emissions. To support our aim of becoming a net-zero business, we have set science-based emissions reduction targets for our own operations (scope 1 and 2) as well as our entire value chain (scope 3) (pending SBTi validation) with the objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in line with the Paris agreement. We leveraged a 1.5 degree-aligned pathway to determine the levers and contributions for each scope and did not consider any other scenarios in the development. Our transition plan is embedded in and aligned with our overall business strategy, as one of our strategic priorities is healthy communities & planet. To achieve a healthy planet, we are committed to lowering our GHG emissions, both in our brands’ own operations and throughout our value chain.

This ensures that our financial resources are allocated effectively to support our sustainability goals, reinforcing our commitment to a healthy planet. There are locked-in emissions associated with the capital goods we procure, for example, refrigerant systems. These emissions are factored into our scope 1 and 2 transition plans. In addition, we have scope 3 locked-in emissions that are calculated in category 11 – use of sold products, which relate to electrical goods. We recognize the lifetime emissions of the electrical goods that we sell in our GHG inventory. We aim to reduce the emissions intensity of the goods we sell, and electrical goods are a component of this strategy. The majority of emissions in category 11 for electrical products occur within the Netherlands, in which the planned decarbonization of the grid is aligned to the achievement of our scope 3 reduction targets. ESRS E1 requires companies to disclose whether they are excluded from the EU Paris-aligned benchmarks, in accordance with the exclusion criteria stated in the Climate Benchmark Standards Regulation1. This regulation requires administrators of EU Paris-aligned benchmarks to exclude from those benchmarks the companies that derive revenues over specified thresholds from certain activities (e.g., coal-, oil- or natural gas-related activities, or high-GHG-intensity electricity generation) and the companies found or estimated to significantly harm one or more of the EU Taxonomy environmental objectives.

"Own operations (scope 1 and 2) Our first goal is to reduce emissions from our local brands’ operations. This is a relatively smaller part of the emissions in our total value chain, but these are the emissions over which we have direct control and can have the biggest direct impact. In 2024, we focused on estimating potential emissions reduction in our own operations from each lever we have identified, and further worked to estimate the resources necessary to implement our mitigation actions. The primary sources of our scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions are refrigerant leakage, electricity consumption, heating and transportation, with electricity consumption and refrigeration representing approximately 80% of total scope 1 and 2 emissions. 4.0 2.5 2.0 1.2 0.4 50% 90% 12% 100% 100% 2018 2025 2030 2035 2040 l GHG planned emissions l % reduction vs. baseline p % zero-emissions electricity Key levers To address the emissions in our brands’ operations, we have identified four key levers that will contribute the most in helping us reach our medium-term target of 2.0 MtCO2e emissions reduction, or a 50% reduction against the 2018 baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e, and our long-term target of becoming net zero (90% reduction and 10% removals) by 2040, also against our 2018 baseline.

"zero-emissions electricity over time, the additional impact on scope 2 emissions will also reduce over time, eventually reaching zero. For Ahold Delhaize, zero-emissions electricity includes electricity from renewable sources and electricity from nuclear sources. Transition to zero-emissions energy In 2024, approximately 34% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions were caused by electricity consumption. Our total electricity consumption is forecasted to further increase due to the electrification of our transportation and heating systems, among other factors. We plan to reduce electricity emissions to zero by 2035. We plan to achieve part of this by generating our own electricity through solar panels installed in both the U.S. and Europe. In 2024, we increased the electricity generated on-site through solar panels and used on-site by 9% compared to 2023. By 2035, we plan to source nearly all electricity, other than own-generated electricity, through virtual and direct PPAs in Europe, while in the U.S., a combination of PPAs, bundled supply contracts, unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) and nuclear energy purchases will be used, depending on the electric market rules. In 2024, we used 49% zero-emissions electricity. We actively invest in renewable energy initiatives. Our solar projects include widespread photovoltaic installations. In Europe, we signed our first pan-European PPA, which is expected to start generating renewable energy in 2026. Transition to low-GWP and natural refrigerants Nearly half (46%) of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions come from our 2024 mix of refrigerant types and associated leakage. Our brands are aiming to reduce refrigerant emissions by executing local climate plans. In order to achieve our net-zero plan, we need to replace or retrofit our refrigeration systems with low-climate-impact alternatives that can use natural or low-GWP refrigerants, minimize leakage and consume less energy. We aim to transition, year by year, to natural and low-GWP refrigerants. Natural refrigerants have significantly lower climate impact than chemical refrigerants and are more energy efficient. Our U.S. businesses are planning to convert equipment for compatibility with low-GWP or natural refrigerants. By 2040, we aim to replace around 1,200 systems with low-GWP systems and fully convert approximately 2,800 systems to natural refrigerant systems. Refrigerant emissions are among the hardest to abate, because addressing them often requires replacing entire refrigeration systems. As such, they make up the largest part of the residual emissions for our U.S. businesses. For our European brands, the current plan is to only convert systems to natural refrigerants. Of the total refrigerant systems, 40% are already using CO2 refrigerants. By 2040, we intend to convert over 1,500 systems to natural refrigerants, representing more than 50% of the total refrigerant systems. Transition from fossil fuels in heating and transportation Our fossil fuel-related emissions come mainly from two sources: transport and heating. Transport by our own fleet includes distribution, to both stores and customers, and personnel cars. These activities account for 10% of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our long-term vision is to achieve 100% fossil-fuel-free transport in both Europe and the U.S. by 2040. This will require us to replace over 5,000 vehicles in the U.S. and over 4,000 in Europe with clean alternatives, such as electric or hydrogen vehicles. Technological maturity plays an important role in how fast we can transition to cleaner energy sources. In the U.S., we face challenges in electrifying our fleets and equipment, especially for long-haul vehicles and charging infrastructure. The increased demand for electricity may also result in grid congestion, because the infrastructure is not ready, which could lead to disruptions in operations. Therefore, we continue to explore other options, such as hydrogen. Likewise, we will need to evaluate the viability of electrifying our fleets in Europe on a country- by-country basis. Natural gas and propane used for heating comprise 9% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions today. Our aim is to gradually electrify our heating systems to eliminate fossil fuel use in both the U.S. and Europe by 2040. Our plans to transition stores from fossil fuels are subject to change, and there are currently no plans to transition certain stores away from district heating systems or to implement electrified heating in select northern U.S. locations, where severe winter conditions may limit its effectiveness. Increase energy efficiency Reduction of electricity consumption is the most direct way to reduce energy-related emissions. While Ahold Delhaize’s total electricity consumption is set to increase as a result of overall decarbonization measures, energy efficiency remains a key lever in reducing environmental impact. We are installing energy-efficient equipment, such as LED lights, doors on cabinets, heat recuperation, heat pumps, new refrigeration systems, improved insulation and new passive doors on freezers. Taking measures like these when remodeling is enabling our brands to create energy-efficient stores. Scope 1 and 2 road to decarbonization The farther in the future our plans are set to be executed, the less certain is the feasibility and achievability of our actions on key levers, as well as the costs of these actions. For actions scheduled to be executed from 2025 to 2028, we have built the plans from the brand level up and included the estimated CapEx necessary to execute them in our long-range plans. We have estimated the feasibility and reduction potential with a reasonable level of reliability, but the actual outcomes can still differ. For the period 2029 to 2040, our plans are more high level and include more assumptions. As a result, we have a higher level of uncertainty around whether our estimated outcomes are achievable and the reductions will materialize as estimated. Our current expectations are that, based upon the identified action plans and the progress we are making, we are on a positive trajectory to meet our targets of 50% reduction by 2030, subject to our estimates and assumptions as set out below. For the period 2030 to 2040, we will continue to make our high-level plans more concrete, taking into account available and developing technology and insights. We have made a lot of progress identifying the high-level plans and actions, and we now have a better view of what our road to net zero until 2040 looks like. However, the high level of uncertainty, due to the longer-term nature of the actions, changing regulations and reliance on technology and infrastructure that is sometimes not yet fully operational or proven in practice, still leads to significant uncertainty and causes us to be dependent on various assumptions to provide more detail (see Assumptions and estimates used in calculations below). To reach net zero in 2040, we will offset our residual emissions by sourcing carbon removal credits. Our current projection is that we will reduce 90% of scope 1 and 2 emissions and offset the remaining 10%. Based on our transition plan, we expect that our residual emissions will come from low-GWP refrigerants and fossil fuels for heating and transportation. For more details on our carbon removals, see section GHG removals and carbon credits below.

Total electricity consumption is expected to increase due to the electrification of transport and heating. ó 100% zero-emissions energy can be acquired at close to parity with grid power. ó When determining the costs of abatement and reduction initiatives, we used current costs and we included costs associated with our leased assets (i.e., we did not assume cost reduction that may take place when technology scales and matures). Investments and funding supporting the implementation of our transition plan The implementation of our transition plan to achieve net-zero emissions will require significant investments in clean, low-emissions and zero-emissions technologies. These investments are covered in our Growing Together strategy, which includes a gross cash capital expenditure cadence of 3% of net sales. We have allocated the necessary financial resources to support our transition plan over the strategic period (until 2028), as this is the time horizon for financial planning and allocation. In our investment plans, we do not differentiate between regular replacement CapEx and incremental CapEx that directly contributes to our scope 1 and 2 reduction program. As a consequence, we do not disclose the monetary amounts related to the incremental investments to reduce our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. It is also important to note that the further we project into the future, the more uncertain these costs become. Factors such as advancements in technology could potentially reduce costs, while high demand might drive them up. In addition, the plans themselves are subject to change as new information and technologies emerge. At the end of each year, we review our total CapEx spend to determine the portion that is eligible and aligned with the EU Taxonomy. While we anticipate that the CapEx spend eligible for the EU Taxonomy will increase in future years, driven by the increase in total CapEx spend for the transition plan, alignment is more difficult to predict, as not all investments will meet the EU Taxonomy alignment criteria. For instance, some investments in vehicles may not fully comply with the DNSH noise regulations, even though they help us in lowering GHG emissions.

"In 2024, we spent: ó €896 million on EU Taxonomy-eligible but not aligned CapEx ó €118 million on EU Taxonomy-eligible and aligned CapEx Of the EU Taxonomy-eligible and aligned CapEx, approximately €37 million is related to the actions mentioned in this transition plan, including refrigerants replacement, investments in fossil fuel-free transport and heating, solar panels and energy efficiency measures. See EU Taxonomy for more information. In 2024, Ahold Delhaize issued a new Green Financing Instrument in the form of a Green Bond for a total notional amount of €500 million. Part of the proceeds of the Green Bond are used to invest in the actions mentioned in this transition plan. The framework used to determine which investments can be considered green is broader than the EU Taxonomy, while being in line with the ICMA (International Capital Markets Association) guidelines and signed off by second-party opinion provider Sustainalytics. Therefore, we expect a larger portion of the total transition plan CapEx spend to align with our Green Finance Framework. Similar to the EU Taxonomy, we report the total CapEx spend that can be considered sustainable according to our Green Bond framework each year. This amount is also expected to increase over the years as we continue to invest more funds in our transition plan. In 2024, we spent approximately €300 million on Green Bond CapEx, of which around €210 million is related to the actions mentioned in this transition plan. This number is lower than the total Green Bond spend because investments in new buildings and investments such as bottle and can collectors and route optimization software, which are part of total Green Bond, are not linked to the transition plan. Each year, we will track our progress by comparing actual emissions reductions against the expected emissions reduction in the transition plan and evaluating our actual investments against the planned investments. The investments related to the transition plan consist of additions to the property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets. See also EU Taxonomy note for a reconciliation of the additions included in the financial statements (Note 11, Note 12, Note 13 and Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) to the total CapEx under the EU Taxonomy. The operating expenses related to the transition plan measures consist mainly of costs related to electricity purchased, diesel/ gasoline for transportation and fuels used for heating and cooling. These are fully integrated into the daily operations and are recorded as part of other operating expenses; see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Value chain (scope 3) The vast majority of our GHG emissions are scope 3, which are indirect emissions that take place across our value chain – for example, emissions generated through the production and manufacturing of the products we sell and the use of those products. Our value chain consists of thousands of suppliers, producers and farmers who supply hundreds of thousands of products that are sold to millions of customers across the U.S. and Europe each day. Our scope 3 emissions are driven by purchased goods and services, use of sold products and other categories (e.g., business travel). The category “purchased goods and services” represented 80% of our total carbon footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3) or 84% of our scope 3 emissions in 2024. For more details on our scope 3 targets, see How we measure our performance. Challenges With the vast majority of our value chain emissions falling outside of our direct control, to achieve our targets, we will need to promote societal change and collaborate across the industry; we cannot achieve our scope 3 targets without working closely with our brands’ suppliers and customers. For this reason, playing a part in wider society and cooperating across our brands’ value chains are integral parts of our plan. Supplier action Our ability to drive scope 3 emissions reduction depends on the efforts of our suppliers and customers. The size and diversity of our supplier network presents challenges as we seek to influence, scale and track decarbonization practices. In some of our local brands’ operating regions, industry bodies are not pursuing climate action until 2030; this inaction will create barriers to value chain decarbonization. Our local brands are encouraging suppliers to set science-based climate targets and engaging with them on specific decarbonization measures. Customer action Addressing the behavior-action gap is complex, as it requires a multi-layered approach and there are many individual and societal factors at play that are not within our direct circle of influence. Our brands’ 150 years of experience in engaging, inviting, nudging and encouraging consumers will help them facilitate this required change in behavior. Key levers To reduce GHG emissions within our supply chain, we have identified the following key priorities: engaging with our brands’ suppliers and farmers, providing an assortment with a lower carbon footprint, and encouraging customers to choose lower-emission products. Engaging suppliers in setting science-based targets and implementing sustainable practices Our brands encourage suppliers to set emissions reduction targets in line with the latest science. These commitments will accelerate improvements in livestock farming, raw material sourcing, processing, transport, packaging, deforestation and food waste reduction and could help address the majority of our scope 3 emissions by 2030. As of January 2025, 61 of Ahold Delhaize’s top 100 suppliers have either set science- based targets or are committed to doing so (SBTi Companies Taking Action). Actions being taken by suppliers include: Livestock farming: GHG emissions from livestock can be reduced by focusing on enteric fermentation and manure management. This involves strategies such as improving animal feed formulas, using feed additives (including bovaer and red algae) to reduce methane emissions, harnessing biogas from liquid manure, and adjusting manure pH with sulfuric acid. Processing: Encouraging suppliers to optimize their production processes through energy efficiency, new machines or switching to renewable energy sources. Environmental information: climate continued Climate change continued Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2024 110"
"Food loss and waste: We seek to combat food loss and waste throughout the value chain across all product categories. This includes losses in agriculture, such as those due to machine failure; post-harvest losses, including from quality defects; losses during processing; and operational waste within our brands’ stores. We tackle food waste through various approaches, including maximizing product utilization, for example, through upcycling; refining product management, such as through enhanced demand planning; and enhancing product distribution, including through decreased transit times or optimized routes. See also Waste. Deforestation-free supply chain: By 2025, Ahold Delhaize and its brands have the ambition to be 100% deforestation and land conversion free for own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil, tea, soy and wood fiber. See also Biodiversity and ecosystems. Agricultural practices: Most of our products are agriculture based. Agriculture can have net positive or negative emissions, depending on the underlying practices used. Ahold Delhaize brands seek to engage with suppliers and farmers to reduce or sequester emissions by incentivizing sustainable change through longer-term contracts with concrete environmental requirements and through co-investments on farms. Activities under this lever include optimizing the use of fertilizers and pesticides; using regenerative agricultural methods, such as no-till farming and cover cropping; and taking measures related to agroforestry, afforestation and reforestation. Low-carbon footprint products Assortment of products: In collaboration with suppliers, our brands seek to reduce the carbon footprint of their local assortments. Our local brands remain committed to empowering customers to make environmentally conscious choices. This strategy varies across our different brands and can include promoting a health-focused and reduced-GHG-emissions product lineup, investing in product development, and transitioning from high- emission protein sources, such as red meat, to lower-emission sources, such as white meat or plant-based alternatives. In Europe, the transition to plant-based proteins is one way we are working toward offering products with a lower carbon footprint. Our European brands agreed to a regional target of at least 50% plant-based sales by 2030. At the same time, this action also reinforces our dedication to a healthier and more sustainable food system and inspires our brands’ customers to make healthier choices. See also Customers’ health and nutrition and access to healthy affordable products. Customer engagement Proactively engaging with customers (unquantified impact): Our local brands encourage customers to shift toward lower- emission products. They continue to help customers understand the impact of their buying decisions and make choices that fit their needs, their tastes and their values. They do this by stimulating and rewarding sustainable choices through loyalty programs and discounts, increasing product transparency through navigation systems and product labelling, improving assortments and products with more vegan and vegetarian choices, and increasing customers’ knowledge of healthy lifestyles by giving them access to free dietitians and knowledge platforms. Recognizing the challenges of behavior change, we focus on addressing the barriers customers have identified, facilitating easier, informed choices through accessible information, inspiration and incentives. We are committed to continuously improving our brands’ product offerings, ensuring that affordable, healthy and sustainable options remain accessible. Scope 3 road to decarbonization Category 1 – Purchased goods and services is the largest scope 3 category. Therefore, when we started working on concrete plans for reducing scope 3 emissions, we prioritized this category. We identified six levers, plus an “other” category to be quantified. Due to the high level of uncertainty around data accuracy and availability, we only report on the estimated reduction potential by 2030 and not up to our long-term and net-zero target date of 2050. Achieving our long-term revised scope 3 emissions targets and our net-zero target will require intense cooperation across the value chain. We considered two scenarios in our analysis. The theoretical reduction potential of the levers remained the same across the scenarios; however, in the lower boundary, we assumed moderate achievability, while, in the upper boundary, we assumed accelerated achievability. We analyzed these two scenarios to understand what the outcomes may be with limited engagement and what would be possible with accelerated engagement. When we assessed the potential to achieve our targets, we took into consideration an assumption on annual growth rate. We anticipate shifts in customer preferences and demand as well as impacts from regulatory factors as we transition to a lower-carbon economy. As part of our transition plan, we aim to help customers choose lower-carbon products. See IRO management for further analysis on transition risks and opportunities. Ahold Delhaize and its brands are currently working to build knowledge and create a broader level of commitment to science-based targets within our supply chain. In addition, we work in partnership with other players in our supply chain to understand the initiatives and levers that they are actioning to decarbonize, linking the GHG emission reduction quantification of the actions to monitor progress toward our collective GHG emissions reduction targets. Based on the quantification of the levers, we believe that they have a cumulative estimated reduction potential of between 8.8 (lower boundary) and 27.6 MtCO2e (upper boundary) by 2030.

"Physical risks outcomes Our 2024 scenario analysis suggests that flash floods, riverine floods and tropical windstorms pose the greatest potential threat to our own operations across future time horizons, in both the Paris Ambition and No Policy scenarios. These results are consistent with our 2023 analysis, with the exception that tropical windstorms now display a higher threat to our brands’ operations than heat waves (which we reported as a top risk in 2023). This change is due to the expansion of our analysis and the nature of the additional facilities included in our 2024 assessment. As shown in the table above, when not considering existing mitigation or adaptation efforts, the model suggests that exposure to physical climate hazards may result in a moderate impact on revenue disruption and potentially a high impact of asset damage. Furthermore, exposure is set to increase by 2040 in both scenarios (albeit within the same risk impact ranges). Although our modeling does not predict significant differences in physical risk exposure across scenarios, the potential for adverse (financial) impact is more pronounced in a No Policy scenario. This is because the Paris Ambition scenario assumes more ambitious climate policy action and mitigation efforts to curb the impacts of climate change and, therefore, reduced overall physical impacts. During 2024, we already experienced operational disruption and asset damage as a result of climate-related events across the locations where our brands operate, including hurricane impact in the U.S. and flooding across Central and Eastern Europe. It is worth noting that the modeled outcome represents a combined physical risk exposure across our many thousands of facilities. The geographical spread of our locations likely reduces the risk of any one event significantly impacting our business. Our climate risk scenario assessment is ongoing, and we will continue to enhance our analysis. As noted, we have not yet come to a final conclusion about the potential financial value at risk as a result of the residual exposure to climate hazards, taking into account existing mitigation efforts such as site- level adaptation plans or insurance coverage. The outcomes of the 2024 climate scenario analysis were considered in the “climate and nature-related” principal risk in our ERM profile. Transition risk outcomes The carbon pricing model analyzes how adjustments in carbon pricing might impact operational costs, such as the cost of power and utilities, and the prices we pay our suppliers. Currently, in the jurisdictions where we operate, Ahold Delhaize is not subject to material policy requirements on carbon pricing, as the focus for GHG emission trading systems and certificates has been centered on energy- intensive sectors. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes a roll-back of any and all existing carbon pricing systems. The Paris Ambition scenario models a far- reaching adoption of increasing rates of carbon taxation, which could present a significant financial burden for our business if mitigating actions are not taken. Whatever the scenario, as we recognize the need to incentivize decision-making to align with our climate-related targets, we apply internal carbon pricing to relevant CapEx investment decisions. See Internal carbon pricing for more details. The significant differences identified in the potential exposure to transition risks between scenarios creates further incentives for us to mitigate transition risks by continuing to work toward achieving our emissions reduction targets to reach net zero by 2050, outlined in our Transition Plan sections above. The consumer sentiment model examines the impact of consumers’ sustainable buying habits on our sales. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes limited to no uptake in products that are perceived as more sustainable, resulting in an expected low impact on our financial position. To meet the Paris Ambition going forward, the model predicts a significant increase in the risk value as customer purchasing decisions are expected to shift drastically toward lower- carbon impact products. This shift could create a moderate unmitigated risk for our business within the next five years, moving to a high risk by 2040. See Managing climate- related risks and opportunities for details on our risk response. In the current context, although our brands’ customers are becoming increasingly climate-aware, elements such as affordability and quality remain as the key drivers for purchasing decisions. Opportunities In our view, the impacts of climate change also offer opportunities. For example, by reducing our emissions and increasing our climate resilience, we believe we can increase operational cost efficiency and attract talented people who wish to work for a company that is actively addressing the impacts within its control and contributing to climate change mitigation. Managing climate-related risks and opportunities The modeling scenarios prepared in the climate risk assessment tool (and in the past) are useful for understanding the potential (financial) impacts of climate change on our business. Beyond that, it is valuable to look more broadly at the results and consider them in the context of our wider organizational risk management processes for further analysis. Our actions and progress to address the impact of climate-related risks on our business (in addition to the scenario analysis work described above) are further explained below. Physical risks ó We limit financial losses by procuring property damage and business interruption (PDBI) insurance against damage from natural catastrophes and weather-related events. ó Our Global Asset Protection function runs an extensive risk engineering program across all our brands to understand, quantify and mitigate a variety of hazards, including natural catastrophes. Risk engineering specialists visit our distribution network and HSCs on an annual rotation to perform risk assessments and provide actionable improvement recommendations. The results of those assessments assist site management and Global Asset Protection in implementing risk mitigation measures proactively and effectively, ensuring better resilience against physical risks. ó On a forward-looking basis, we leverage the expertise of the risk engineers for new building designs and construction projects to implement risk mitigation elements during the planning phase. ó Our brands implement various adaptation measures to protect the business from climate change impacts, for example, enhancing drainage and installing rainwater collection system to adapt to flood or drought risk. ó Our food retail brands are engaging with suppliers to implement sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate risks around product procurement and decreasing agricultural yields.

"We utilized scenario assessment to understand the way that six of the most severe risks might evolve under a pessimistic scenario.

Transition risks ó Consumer preferences ó Investor sentiment ó Community and stakeholder conflict1 ó Adverse media and NGO attention ó Policy and regulations1 ó Litigation and liability1 ó Monitoring1 ó Production systems Example Increasing policy and regulations on nature and biodiversity can pose a transition risk. These regulations could also create exposure to litigation. We actively manage risks relating to new policies, litigation and regulations as part of our GRC framework. As an example of recent action on environmental regulations, this year we took significant steps to prepare the business for the EU Regulation on Deforestation Free Products (EUDR) introduction. Opportunities ó Plant-based transition1 ó Investment in regenerative agriculture ó Increase in organic assortment ó Diversification of product portfolio to include the adoption of broader varieties Example Increasing the sale of plant-based products has the potential to reduce pressure on nature and climate and to support positive health outcomes for our brands’ customers. See Climate change for EU targets set in relation to the plant-based protein transition as part of scope 3 reduction activities. 1. The underlined topics were initially identified to be the most severe. Updating our approach to nature In 2024, we took several significant steps to better understand our relationship to nature and to build our thinking around an updated approach. Key actions this year included: ó Producing a detailed impact, dependency and risk assessment and identifying priority value chains (via the nature project). ó Performing an initial analysis of nature impacts in feed, national-brand and packaging value chains for one of our brands. ó Establishing a Nature Working Group to facilitate the education and cross-pollination of work on nature across our brands. ó Holding several education sessions on nature with our brands and with leadership groups, including our SLT and our H&S Leadership Community. ó Enhancing our disclosure of nature-related impacts, risks and opportunities. In this Annual Report, we included, for the first time, a TNFD index to demonstrate our initial work toward implementing the recommendations of the TNFD. In the coming year, we will continue to build out our approach to nature, to determine whether we need to update our policies, allocate resources and set actions, metrics and targets.

To do so, we drew upon the TNFD’s critical uncertainties matrix, utilizing scenario #3, “sand in the gears.” We did not explicitly consider systemic risk in this assessment. Physical risks ó Water availability1 ó Water quality1 ó Soil quality ó Invasive species1 ó Pollinator decline ó Herbicide resistance1 ó Loss of genetic diversity1 ó Pests and diseases ó Air pollution ó Habitat loss Example Reduction in the availability and flow of water could result in supply chain disruption, reduced availability or increased prices. Higher-risk value chains include fruit and vegetables from Spain. Ahold Delhaize and its brands are engaging with suppliers to mitigate risks around agricultural yields driven by nature and climate risk. See Climate change: Process to identify and assess material climate change mitigation and adaptation-related IROs paragraph for more information. Transition risks ó Consumer preferences ó Investor sentiment ó Community and stakeholder conflict1 ó Adverse media and NGO attention ó Policy and regulations1 ó Litigation and liability1 ó Monitoring1 ó Production systems Example Increasing policy and regulations on nature and biodiversity can pose a transition risk. These regulations could also create exposure to litigation. We actively manage risks relating to new policies, litigation and regulations as part of our GRC framework. As an example of recent action on environmental regulations, this year we took significant steps to prepare the business for the EU Regulation on Deforestation Free Products (EUDR) introduction. Opportunities ó Plant-based transition1 ó Investment in regenerative agriculture ó Increase in organic assortment ó Diversification of product portfolio to include the adoption of broader varieties Example Increasing the sale of plant-based products has the potential to reduce pressure on nature and climate and to support positive health outcomes for our brands’ customers. See Climate change for EU targets set in relation to the plant-based protein transition as part of scope 3 reduction activities. 1. The underlined topics were initially identified to be the most severe. Updating our approach to nature In 2024, we took several significant steps to better understand our relationship to nature and to build our thinking around an updated approach. Key actions this year included: ó Producing a detailed impact, dependency and risk assessment and identifying priority value chains (via the nature project). ó Performing an initial analysis of nature impacts in feed, national-brand and packaging value chains for one of our brands. ó Establishing a Nature Working Group to facilitate the education and cross-pollination of work on nature across our brands. ó Holding several education sessions on nature with our brands and with leadership groups, including our SLT and our H&S Leadership Community. ó Enhancing our disclosure of nature-related impacts, risks and opportunities. In this Annual Report, we included, for the first time, a TNFD index to demonstrate our initial work toward implementing the recommendations of the TNFD. In the coming year, we will continue to build out our approach to nature, to determine whether we need to update our policies, allocate resources and set actions, metrics and targets.

"Physical risks outcomes Our 2024 scenario analysis suggests that flash floods, riverine floods and tropical windstorms pose the greatest potential threat to our own operations across future time horizons, in both the Paris Ambition and No Policy scenarios. These results are consistent with our 2023 analysis, with the exception that tropical windstorms now display a higher threat to our brands’ operations than heat waves (which we reported as a top risk in 2023). This change is due to the expansion of our analysis and the nature of the additional facilities included in our 2024 assessment. As shown in the table above, when not considering existing mitigation or adaptation efforts, the model suggests that exposure to physical climate hazards may result in a moderate impact on revenue disruption and potentially a high impact of asset damage. Furthermore, exposure is set to increase by 2040 in both scenarios (albeit within the same risk impact ranges). Although our modeling does not predict significant differences in physical risk exposure across scenarios, the potential for adverse (financial) impact is more pronounced in a No Policy scenario. This is because the Paris Ambition scenario assumes more ambitious climate policy action and mitigation efforts to curb the impacts of climate change and, therefore, reduced overall physical impacts. During 2024, we already experienced operational disruption and asset damage as a result of climate-related events across the locations where our brands operate, including hurricane impact in the U.S. and flooding across Central and Eastern Europe. It is worth noting that the modeled outcome represents a combined physical risk exposure across our many thousands of facilities. The geographical spread of our locations likely reduces the risk of any one event significantly impacting our business. Our climate risk scenario assessment is ongoing, and we will continue to enhance our analysis. As noted, we have not yet come to a final conclusion about the potential financial value at risk as a result of the residual exposure to climate hazards, taking into account existing mitigation efforts such as site- level adaptation plans or insurance coverage. The outcomes of the 2024 climate scenario analysis were considered in the “climate and nature-related” principal risk in our ERM profile. Transition risk outcomes The carbon pricing model analyzes how adjustments in carbon pricing might impact operational costs, such as the cost of power and utilities, and the prices we pay our suppliers. Currently, in the jurisdictions where we operate, Ahold Delhaize is not subject to material policy requirements on carbon pricing, as the focus for GHG emission trading systems and certificates has been centered on energy- intensive sectors. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes a roll-back of any and all existing carbon pricing systems. The Paris Ambition scenario models a far- reaching adoption of increasing rates of carbon taxation, which could present a significant financial burden for our business if mitigating actions are not taken. Whatever the scenario, as we recognize the need to incentivize decision-making to align with our climate-related targets, we apply internal carbon pricing to relevant CapEx investment decisions. See Internal carbon pricing for more details. The significant differences identified in the potential exposure to transition risks between scenarios creates further incentives for us to mitigate transition risks by continuing to work toward achieving our emissions reduction targets to reach net zero by 2050, outlined in our Transition Plan sections above. The consumer sentiment model examines the impact of consumers’ sustainable buying habits on our sales. In a No Policy scenario, the model assumes limited to no uptake in products that are perceived as more sustainable, resulting in an expected low impact on our financial position. To meet the Paris Ambition going forward, the model predicts a significant increase in the risk value as customer purchasing decisions are expected to shift drastically toward lower- carbon impact products. This shift could create a moderate unmitigated risk for our business within the next five years, moving to a high risk by 2040. See Managing climate- related risks and opportunities for details on our risk response. In the current context, although our brands’ customers are becoming increasingly climate-aware, elements such as affordability and quality remain as the key drivers for purchasing decisions. Opportunities In our view, the impacts of climate change also offer opportunities. For example, by reducing our emissions and increasing our climate resilience, we believe we can increase operational cost efficiency and attract talented people who wish to work for a company that is actively addressing the impacts within its control and contributing to climate change mitigation. Managing climate-related risks and opportunities The modeling scenarios prepared in the climate risk assessment tool (and in the past) are useful for understanding the potential (financial) impacts of climate change on our business. Beyond that, it is valuable to look more broadly at the results and consider them in the context of our wider organizational risk management processes for further analysis. Our actions and progress to address the impact of climate-related risks on our business (in addition to the scenario analysis work described above) are further explained below. Physical risks ó We limit financial losses by procuring property damage and business interruption (PDBI) insurance against damage from natural catastrophes and weather-related events. ó Our Global Asset Protection function runs an extensive risk engineering program across all our brands to understand, quantify and mitigate a variety of hazards, including natural catastrophes. Risk engineering specialists visit our distribution network and HSCs on an annual rotation to perform risk assessments and provide actionable improvement recommendations. The results of those assessments assist site management and Global Asset Protection in implementing risk mitigation measures proactively and effectively, ensuring better resilience against physical risks. ó On a forward-looking basis, we leverage the expertise of the risk engineers for new building designs and construction projects to implement risk mitigation elements during the planning phase. ó Our brands implement various adaptation measures to protect the business from climate change impacts, for example, enhancing drainage and installing rainwater collection system to adapt to flood or drought risk. ó Our food retail brands are engaging with suppliers to implement sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate risks around product procurement and decreasing agricultural yields.

"Transition risks: Regulatory risks ó We aim to reduce our carbon footprint by identifying and implementing ways of making equipment in use and buildings more energy efficient – see Own operations (scope 1 and 2). ó We are mitigating regulatory risks through our work on sustainable packaging, food waste, sustainable sourcing, reformulation of own- brand products, product transparency and the expansion of our brands’ ranges to include more low-carbon products. Transition risks: Market risks ó Our brands are developing and diversifying their product offerings to provide customers with more plant-based meat and dairy alternatives, to ensure that our business model and product assortments remain competitive and compatible with changing customer demands. ó Our net-zero ambitions identify the use of renewable energy as a way to reduce our carbon footprint. While our brands continue to make use of opportunities to install more solar panels, they also actively pursue the acquisition of other sources of renewable energy, such as (virtual) PPAs for green energy. Next steps Based on the 2024 physical hazard assessment results, we are evaluating the adaptation solutions that have been implemented or may be available at facilities with elevated climate hazard exposure. To further understand the residual climate risk that these facilities may face, we will continue to consult with local teams to evaluate existing protection measures and resilience strategies, such as design standards, business continuity plans, local climate action plans and climate considerations in CapEx investment proposals. In addition, we plan to assess climate risks across our value chain in due course. The transition insights we have gained provide further support for our transition plan and help us focus our efforts on achieving strategic, climate-related opportunities, for example, by informing more sustainable product decisions. Policies We have an overarching sustainability policy that covers our approach on climate and specific climate-related standards that provide further guidance to our brands. See also General information: Governance. Within our climate approach, we are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol. See Climate change in the Sustainability notes for more details on our methodology. Our standard on renewable energy introduces the approach of Ahold Delhaize and its local brands to sourcing renewable energy and implementing energy efficiency measures, which are linked to the key levers identified in our transition plan. It concerns the sourcing of renewable energy to achieve net-zero emissions in the Company’s market-based scope 2 footprint. It is applicable to our global operations and excludes renewable energy consumed outside our own operations, i.e., in the value chain, and energy carriers such as fuels. By adhering to these guidelines, we strive to achieve zero-emissions electricity by 2035. Our standard on carbon offsets includes our approach on the use of offsets to achieve our net-zero goals. It covers the neutralization of residual emissions in Ahold Delhaize’s own operations (scope 1 and 2) through carbon removal projects outside of the Company’s own operations and value chain. The standard establishes a framework for purchasing high- integrity offsets that contribute to our net-zero targets, while remaining aligned with Ahold Delhaize’s overall sustainability values. See also GHG removals and carbon credits. Actions and resources Our actions to reduce our negative impacts and mitigate risks are centered on the following topics: GHG emissions and CCM See Transition plan for an explanation of the key levers, the actions undertaken by the brands and the resources allocated. Management of climate-related risks See Climate-related risks for work done to assess climate-related risks, outcomes and next steps. How we measure our performance In order to ensure that measures are taken to reduce GHG emissions in our own operations and supply chain and to increase energy efficiency in our own operations, we have set the targets mentioned below. In setting up our targets, we engaged with brands stakeholders as well as with senior leadership teams and the Executive Committee. As the SBTi is the only internationally recognized GHG-target setting body, our targets are aligned to their pathways and are pending validation, except for the scope 1 and 2 near-term target, which has been approved. We currently have no additional targets set on climate-related risks and opportunities, CCA or transition risk mitigation. As we advance our work on climate, we will evaluate the need to define and update our targets. Scope 1 and 2 targets Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) (2018 baseline1) Short term >38% reduction by 2025 Near term 50% reduction by 20302 Long term Net zero: 90% reduction and 10% removals by 2040 Milestone Near term We plan to reduce electricity emissions to zero by 2035. Timeline Target 1. The 2018 restated baseline is 4.0 MtCO2e. 2. The SBTi has approved Ahold Delhaize’s scope 1 and 2 near-term science-based emissions reduction targets. These targets are based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. Ahold Delhaize developed science-based targets (SBTs) for scopes 1 and 2 (market- based) in 2019, and submitted targets to the SBTi for validation in 2020. Our near-term emissions reduction targets for scope 1 and 2, set in 2019, have been formally approved by the SBTi. This means that the SBTi has assessed the targets against the emissions reduction pathways necessary for the world to limit global average temperature rise 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels and found them to be consistent with that outcome. In accordance with SBTi technical guidance on setting SBTs, 2018 was selected as the baseline year, since it was the most recent year with robust scope 1 and 2 footprint data. The 2018 (restated) baseline for SBTi target setting is 4.0 MtCO2e; see Sustainability notes for further details.

"Scope 3 targets Scope 3 (2020 SBTi-methodology baseline) Short term ó Suppliers representing 70% of our footprint will be asked to commit to the SBTi by 2025. ó All our suppliers will be asked to report on scope 3 by 2025. Near term1 ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 30.3% by 2030 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for near-term target (of 16.8 MtCO2e)1. ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 E&I GHG emissions by 42.0% by 2030 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for near-term target (of 23.7 MtCO2e)1. Long term2 ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by at least 72% by 2050 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for long-term target (of 22.6 MtCO2e)2, 3. ó We commit to reduce absolute scope 3 E&I GHG emissions by 90% by 2050 from the 2020 SBTi baseline for long-term target (of 29.2 MtCO2e)2, 3. Net zero ó We commit to reach net-zero GHG emissions across our value chain by 20503. Timeline Target 1. Committed, but not yet approved by the SBTi, the target is based on a 1.5-degree decarbonization pathway. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 2. Ahold Delhaize has also committed to set long-term scope 3 emissions reduction and net-zero targets by 2050. These targets are submitted, but not yet validated by the SBTi. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more detail. 3. In the setting of our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are planning to also make use of removals to the extent permitted by the SBTi guidance. In 2023, in line with the SBTi guidance on land-related (forest, land and agriculture sector or FLAG) and non-land-related (Energy and Industrial sector or E&I), we replaced both our near-term and long-term scope 3 GHG emissions reduction targets with two reduction targets, FLAG and E&I sector targets. Both our near-term (2030) and our long-term (2050) scope 3 reduction targets are consistent with the SBTi methodology with the aim of maintaining the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase within 1.5°C of pre- industrial temperatures. The estimated FLAG emissions make up 42% our total GHG footprint in 2024. In setting the target, we applied the SBTi FLAG Standard with a linear annual reduction of 3.03%. For the E&I sector emissions target, we consider the SBTi's 4.2% annual reduction. We submitted the scope 3 targets to the SBTi in October 2023 and they are pending validation. Conversations and responses to queries from the SBTi on our submitted scope 3 targets are ongoing. We continue to use 2020 as our baseline year for scope 3, consistent with the prior submissions, given the improved quality and robustness of our local brands’ data for that year. The near-term (2030) reduction targets cover 67% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories, while the long-term (2050) reduction targets cover 90% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more details on the calculation. For setting our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are making use of removals to the extent permitted by the applicable SBTi guidance. As a general rule, the use of carbon credits must not be counted as emissions reduction toward the progress of a company’s near-term science-based targets. Carbon credits may only be considered an option for neutralizing residual emissions or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond the science-based emissions reduction targets. We follow this principle in our target setting. See GHG removals and carbon credits for more details on our approach to carbon credits. Avoided emissions fall under a separate accounting system from corporate inventories and do not count toward science-based targets. Metrics We are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol, which defines a global standardized framework for the measurement and management of GHG emissions from the private and public sectors. Our carbon footprint methodology follows the guidelines of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/WRI and we report our GHG emissions data with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our methodology, estimates and judgments around the metrics used are included in Sustainability notes. Energy consumption and mix For details on the energy consumption and mix and energy intensity, see Climate change in the Sustainability notes. Gross scope 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions For details on the GHG emissions and GHG intensity, see Climate change in the Sustainability notes. Performance management GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) 2024 2023 restated Change vs. prior year Target 2030 Absolute CO2e emissions from own operations (MtCO2e) 2.58 2.65 (0.07) % reduction in absolute CO2e emissions from own operations against 2018 baseline1 36% 34% 2pp 50% 1. Compared to the 2018 restated baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e Compared to our 2018 baseline, GHG emissions decreased by 36% in 2024. The main driver for the higher reduction percentage compared to last year was our reduction in emissions coming from refrigerants, demonstrating that our investments in cleaner refrigerants are paying off. GHG emissions from refrigerant leakages remained our largest source of emissions. In 2024, these emissions totaled 1,199 kilotonnes, compared to 1,323 kilotonnes in 2023. In 2024, we saw a slight decrease in our leak rate. Furthermore, because we replaced high-GWP refrigerants with low-GWP and natural refrigerants, the average GWP of these leakages decreased. Refrigerant emissions per square meter of sales area were 144 kilograms CO2e compared to 153 kilograms CO2e last year.

The estimated FLAG emissions make up 42% our total GHG footprint in 2024. In setting the target, we applied the SBTi FLAG Standard with a linear annual reduction of 3.03%. For the E&I sector emissions target, we consider the SBTi's 4.2% annual reduction. We submitted the scope 3 targets to the SBTi in October 2023 and they are pending validation. Conversations and responses to queries from the SBTi on our submitted scope 3 targets are ongoing. We continue to use 2020 as our baseline year for scope 3, consistent with the prior submissions, given the improved quality and robustness of our local brands’ data for that year. The near-term (2030) reduction targets cover 67% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories, while the long-term (2050) reduction targets cover 90% of category 1 purchased goods and services emissions, 0% of categories 14 and 15 and 100% of emissions under the remaining scope 3 categories. See table Overview of the calculation of our SBTi-methodology baseline for scope 3 in the Sustainability notes for more details on the calculation. For setting our long-term and net-zero SBTi targets, we are making use of removals to the extent permitted by the applicable SBTi guidance. As a general rule, the use of carbon credits must not be counted as emissions reduction toward the progress of a company’s near-term science-based targets. Carbon credits may only be considered an option for neutralizing residual emissions or to finance additional climate mitigation beyond the science-based emissions reduction targets. We follow this principle in our target setting. See GHG removals and carbon credits for more details on our approach to carbon credits. Avoided emissions fall under a separate accounting system from corporate inventories and do not count toward science-based targets. Metrics We are guided by the standards of the GHG Protocol, which defines a global standardized framework for the measurement and management of GHG emissions from the private and public sectors. Our carbon footprint methodology follows the guidelines of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)/WRI and we report our GHG emissions data with reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Our methodology, estimates and judgments around the metrics used are included in Sustainability notes. Energy consumption and mix For details on the energy consumption and mix and energy intensity, see Climate change in the Sustainability notes. Gross scope 1, 2, 3 and total GHG emissions For details on the GHG emissions and GHG intensity, see Climate change in the Sustainability notes. Performance management GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) 2024 2023 restated Change vs. prior year Target 2030 Absolute CO2e emissions from own operations (MtCO2e) 2.58 2.65 (0.07) % reduction in absolute CO2e emissions from own operations against 2018 baseline1 36% 34% 2pp 50% 1. Compared to the 2018 restated baseline of 4.0 MtCO2e Compared to our 2018 baseline, GHG emissions decreased by 36% in 2024. The main driver for the higher reduction percentage compared to last year was our reduction in emissions coming from refrigerants, demonstrating that our investments in cleaner refrigerants are paying off. GHG emissions from refrigerant leakages remained our largest source of emissions. In 2024, these emissions totaled 1,199 kilotonnes, compared to 1,323 kilotonnes in 2023. In 2024, we saw a slight decrease in our leak rate. Furthermore, because we replaced high-GWP refrigerants with low-GWP and natural refrigerants, the average GWP of these leakages decreased. Refrigerant emissions per square meter of sales area were 144 kilograms CO2e compared to 153 kilograms CO2e last year.

"We will use the results of the nature project to review and determine what the next steps will be. We currently focus on our own-brand supply chain, as this is where we have the greatest oversight and control over the way products are farmed, produced and packaged. Over time, we will continue to consider how we can better understand and address these issues within our national-brand supply chains. In addition, the EU has legislation addressing deforestation: the EUDR. Ahold Delhaize and its European brands will comply with this regulation when it becomes applicable. The EUDR entered into force in June 2023 and was initially scheduled to become applicable on December 30, 2024. However, the EU Parliament and the Council have recently agreed to the Commission’s proposal to delay its application by one year to give companies and authorities more time to better prepare for its implementation. This legislation aims to minimize deforestation and forest degradation associated with certain commodities and relevant products placed on the EU market. Sustainable and regenerative agriculture Poor farming practices can have adverse impacts on soil, waterways and biodiversity. As well as resulting in environmental damage, these practices can also undermine the resilience and productivity of food supply chains, which has consequences for food security, communities and businesses alike. We identified several of the topics impacted by unsustainable farming practices as material sub-sub-topics during the DMA: land degradation, climate change (see Climate change), pollution of air, soil and water (see Pollution), water consumption and withdrawals (see Water and marine resources), and impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services. Ahold Delhaize currently does not have a policy on sustainable and regenerative agriculture and, as these are topics within the value chain, the transitional phase-in provisions will be utilized for reporting. All brands are, however, encouraged to support these types of farming practices. The nature of this support will depend on the resources and capacity of the brand and the make-up and structure of its supply chain. Actions and resources Actions to implement the existing policies around biodiversity and ecosystems did not result in significant, separately identifiable operating or capital expenditure in 2024. Ahold Delhaize brands have dedicated Health and Sustainability teams that address matters relating to biodiversity alongside other sustainability topics. In addition to the actions discussed below, many other elements of our healthy communities & planet approach also reduce our negative impacts on nature and biodiversity. This includes actions to reduce plastic packaging and food waste and lessen our climate impact, and efforts to lead the transition to sustainable protein. We do not currently incorporate Indigenous knowledge into actions on biodiversity and ecosystems or use any biodiversity offsets. Standards of Engagement According to our Standards of Engagement 4.0, which is being rolled out over the coming years, we expect our suppliers to: ó Comply with all applicable environmental legislation and maintain all relevant permits, including, but not limited to, deforestation and/or land conversion (e.g., EU Regulation on deforestation-free products) and agro-chemical and pesticide storage, use and management ó Not source materials associated with deforestation or land conversion, in line with the respective cut-off dates prescribed by legislation and/or by relevant standards (e.g., Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) See also Workers in the value chain for more information about our Standards of Engagement. Deforestation and land conversion Ahold Delhaize and its brands aim to be 100% deforestation and land conversion free for own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil, tea, soy and wood fiber by 2025. We achieve this by: ó Sourcing own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil and tea that are, as much as possible, certified against an accepted standard ó Sourcing high-risk (South American) soy volume in own-brand supply chains covered by accepted physical certification or credits ó Sourcing own-brand wood fiber-based products and packaging either certified against an accepted standard, classified as low-risk or recycled The requirements for accepted standards and credits are set out in the Sustainability notes. Sustainable and regenerative agriculture The Ahold Delhaize brands support sustainable and/or regenerative agriculture through multiple channels, including: ó Use of standards and certifications ó Establishment of brand-specific farming programs ó Partnerships with suppliers ó Support for NGOs and farming groups Agriculture is a place-based science, which means that the most appropriate sustainable or regenerative practices will differ according to the local region, climate, crop and farm environment. Many of our brands work with initiatives such as the GLOBALG.A.P. to contribute to sustainable agriculture in their upstream value chains. Our brands are working to further integrate sustainable agriculture expectations into sourcing requirements. Many work directly with suppliers to adopt sustainable agriculture practices that include conserving natural resources, reducing land conversion and improving soil health. In addition, this year, our U.S. and Belgian brands announced regenerative agriculture pilots in partnership with our suppliers. These pilots focused on commodities, such as wheat and oats. Following the completion of these pilots, we will identify key learnings and share them across the brands. These activities relate to the mitigation hierarchy layers of avoiding, minimizing and regenerating nature.

"More sustainable consumption patterns We aim to encourage customers, for example, through our product offering, to increase their consumption of plant-based proteins, which, when produced sustainably, have fewer environmental impacts than animal-based proteins. See also Climate change: scope 3 key levers for the European activities around transitioning to more plant-based protein. This action relates to the mitigation hierarchy layer of reducing the impact and risk of our supply chains on nature. Annual risks assessments Our brands conduct an annual sustainability risk assessment to identify social and environmental risks linked to our sourcing practices. This assessment considers environmental impacts such as land conversion, pesticide use and water use, as well as a range of social impacts. Our brands use its outputs to inform their ongoing work on these topics in their supply chains. Multi-stakeholder partnerships We know that transitioning to a more sustainable food system will require coordinated action from a variety of actors across governments and NGOs and within food and beverage value chains. For this reason, we are involved in several multi- stakeholder forums centered on critical social and environmental challenges and solutions linked to biodiversity and ecosystems. To advocate progression in supply chains and promote system change: The Tropical Forest Alliance (TFA) A multi-stakeholder partnership platform supporting companies in the global transition to deforestation-free supply chains for commodities like palm oil, soy, beef and paper/pulp. The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) A global partnership promoting sustainable palm oil production, processing, trade and use through the development and implementation of global standards. The Retailer Palm Oil Group (RPOG) A non-competitive coalition of retail companies committed to using sustainable palm oil in their products, aiming to make sustainable palm oil the norm. The Palm Oil Transparency Coalition (POTC) A pre-competitive coalition working to remove deforestation and exploitation from palm oil production. Focuses on transparency, traceability and sustainability in palm oil supply chains through, for example, their annual trader assessment. Multi-stakeholder collaboration Focus The Round Table for Responsible Soy (RTRS) Promotes responsible soy production, processing, trade and use. Develops and implements global certification standards for sustainable soy. The Retailer Soy Group (RSG) A non-competitive group of retail companies committed to increasing the use of sustainable soy in their products, aiming to make sustainable soy the norm and increase transparency in the soy supply chains. Transitioning farming systems: Sustainable Agriculture Initiative (SAI) Regenerating Together Group Ahold Delhaize was a founding member of the SAI’s “Regenerating Together” group and subsequent program. The working group has members spanning food value chains and supports the development of a regenerative agriculture framework. Multi-stakeholder collaboration Focus How we measure our performance To measure our performance, we have the following ambition in place addressing land conversion and deforestation, which is focused on the sourcing of own-brand critical commodities: Timeline Ambition Short term By 2025, Ahold Delhaize and its brands aim to be 100% deforestation- and land- conversion free for own-brand products containing soy, palm oil, cocoa, coffee, wood fiber and tea. We refer to no deforestation or land conversion as defined by the Accountability Framework Initiative or the Forest Resources Assessment. The cut-off date we use is December 31, 2020, or the date of the applicable certification, whichever is earlier. We achieve this by having: ó 100% of own-brand products containing coffee, cocoa, palm oil and tea certified against an accepted standard ó 100% of high-risk (South American) soy volume in own-brand supply chains covered by accepted physical certification or credits ó 100% of own-brand wood fiber-based products and packaging either certified against an accepted standard, classified as low-risk or recycled Environmental information: nature continued Biodiversity and ecosystems continued Ahold Delhaize Annual Report 2024 129"
"once and fold one cardboard box around them. Smarter, customized packaging means smaller packages, less packaging material and as little empty air as possible, and also a lower carbon footprint per delivered package. Our brands support responsible forest management by using, as much as possible, 100% Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)- or Program for Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC)-certified paper and cardboard. See also the wood fiber critical commodity indicator included under Biodiversity and ecosystems. To increase the recycling of different packaging materials, a number of our brands also offer recycling stations at their stores, where customers can deposit materials like glass, paper and batteries for recycling. Some of our brands also provide facilities to collect plastic and glass bottles, specifically in cases where there are deposits on the bottles, such as in the Netherlands. The recently adopted EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation will harmonize packaging rules across all the member states. Ahold Delhaize is developing a compliance plan to align with this. It will be applied to all packaging placed on the EU market and all packaging waste referenced in the regulation. Partnerships We also work with several umbrella organizations to find solutions for sustainable packaging. Some of our brands are members of national plastic pacts that are implementing solutions toward a circular economy for plastic. For example, Albert Heijn is a member of the Dutch Plastics Pact, while Ahold Delhaize USA is a member of the U.S. Plastics Pact and the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, a membership-based collaborative that believes in the power of industry to make packaging more sustainable. How we measure our performance Consistent with the disclosure in our Annual Report 2023, we expect that we will not achieve our targets related to RRC and recycled content, due to issues ranging from the scaling up of reusable packaging to the availability of a robust recycling infrastructure for certain plastic packaging categories within some of our brands’ markets. See also the key findings from the The Global Commitment 2024 progress report above. However, we have already surpassed our virgin plastic reduction target. To measure our performance, we have the following targets in place: Timeline Target Short term 100% of primary own-brand plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable in practice and at scale by 2025. By 2025, our brands aim to reduce the use of virgin plastic in their own-brand primary product packaging by 5% compared to the 2021 baseline. 25% of our total own-brand primary plastic packaging weight will be made from recycled content by 2025. Our targets are voluntary and have been informed by the partnership with the EMF New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, and the scientific resources made available by it. Our current targets on packaging have a time horizon up to the end of 2025. In 2025, we will determine the most appropriate future targets or ambitions and actions going forward, where applicable. We currently do not have targets in place to monitor the progress of our national-brand suppliers have made to reduce the negative environmental impacts of the production, use and disposal of (virgin) plastics, cardboard and other (non-)compostable primary and secondary packaging materials used and sold by Ahold Delhaize's brands, nor do we have targets on packaging materials other than own-brand primary plastic packaging. Therefore, we make use of the transitional provisions on these value chain topics. Metrics As discussed earlier in this section, our metrics are focusing on own-brand primary product packaging. In addition, see also our reporting on total waste in Sustainability notes – Waste, which includes reporting on other types of waste recycled, such as secondary and tertiary packaging materials. The assessment methodology for recyclability follows the guidelines of the EMF New Plastics Economy Global Commitment regarding recyclability of plastic packaging, which means that actual, not technical, recycling is used for reporting. See Sustainability notes – Packaging for more information on our methodology. In several of our brands’ markets, and for several plastic packaging types, actual recycling infrastructure is not yet established, and, as such, the plastics are not reported as recyclable, even though they may technically be recyclable. In the coming year, we will review these targets and look to identify what steps, if any, can be taken to close the gap while maintaining alignment with our overall strategy. Performance management Performance indicator description 2024 2023 restated Change vs. prior year % of own-brand primary plastic product packaging that is made from recycled content 15.7% 14.8% 0.9pp % reduction/(increase) in own-brand primary virgin plastic product packaging against the 2021 baseline 10.3% 10.2% 0.02pp % primary plastic own- brand product packaging that is reusable, recyclable or compostable 32.7 % 28.44 % 4.3pp By 2024, we had reduced our virgin plastic packaging by 10.3% compared to our 2021 baseline, a minimal improvement compared to last year’s 10.2% decrease against the baseline. Total weight of virgin plastic packaging totaled 144 thousand tonnes, which is 38 tonnes lower than the previous year and, thus, basically equal to the 2023 number. This reduction in virgin plastic packaging was mostly realized due to a higher percentage of recycled content in plastic content as total plastic packaging volumes increased. In 2024, 15.7% of own- brand plastic product packaging is from recycled content, a 0.9 percentage-point improvement compared to 2023. In 2024, 33% of our own-brand primary plastic packaging was reusable, recyclable or compostable, a 4.3 percentage-point improvement compared to 2023.

The environmental taxonomy framework does not allow the Group to assess all mitigation actions carried out and referred to in ESRS E1. This is because the Group’s core business is caring for those in need and most of its revenue is earned in exchange for personal services, care and medical treatment provided to people in vulnerable situations. Clariane primarily has a social purpose, and this can only be assessed under the social taxonomy, which has not yet been drawn up by the European authorities. To date, only the environmental taxonomy has been codified (EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852). Work to define a social taxonomy is still ongoing, and no timetable has been set as yet. As a result, the Group has not set a target for aligning its turnover (revenue), OpEx and CapEx with the environmental taxonomy. This is due to the fact that: • the text of the environmental taxonomy only allows for the recognition of revenue from property rentals and sales under Activity 12.1 “Residential care activities” related to the climate change adaptation objective. Accordingly, revenue from caring for residents and patients, the Group’s core business, is excluded; • the materiality exemption is applied to OpEx that meet the taxonomy definition as they are not material; • for the 2024 taxonomy reporting, only CapEx over the €0.8 million threshold was analysed, making it impossible to obtain an accurate picture of all eligible CapEx. The Group expects its CapEx alignment to increase going forward, in line with the internal work carried out on the granularity of analysis by type of CapEx, enabling in particular CapEx contributing to decarbonisation to be monitored and individual measures to be assessed from 2025 onwards. Work in progress on centralising data relating to the Group’s real estate portfolio – and in particular building specifications – will also facilitate alignment analysis. 2024 Universal Registration Document — Clariane 122 Sustainability Statement and Duty of Care Plan Disclosures relating to environmental matters 3"

"Material impacts and risks IRO IRO Attraction and retention of talent and work-life balance Our ability to attract and retain a workforce with the necessary skills and experience is fundamental to our success and relates to other identified impacts, including work-life balance. In a competitive labour market, as well as under potential reputational pressures, difficulties in attracting or retaining employees could negatively impact our performance and strategic objectives. The identified risk arises from the dependencies on our own workforce, particularly those working in locations and function where there is a high demand within pharmaceu- tical research, development, manufacturing and commercial. The risk has been identified through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The vaccine sector can be subject to fluctuating market demands, due to external factors such as urgent responses to disease outbreaks. As an employer, we are responsible for shaping working conditions and work-life balance for our employees, impacting their overall well-being and job satisfac- tion, which ultimately affects our ability to retain talent. Peak periods can affect people working in various departments and sites throughout the organization, as they could lead to additional work- load. Policies & processes Remote working policy Our remote working policy defines the governing framework for employees performing working hours outside the organization's premises. The policy applies universally to all employees and is intended to enhance operational efficiency, employee engagement and organizational alignment through structured and flexible working arrangement. The policy reflects our commitment to flexible workplace practices, prioritizing well-being and adaptability to modern work requirements. The New Ways of Working initiative With the aim to increase flexibility and enhance work-life balance, we introduced our New Ways of Working initiative in 2021. Through this, we actively encourage employees to work collaboratively and adopt flexible working arrangements. By fostering a culture of flexibility, and improved work spaces at our offices, we provide a framework for work practices, which support employees in achieving improved work-life balance, also in peak periods. Actions In 2024, we initiated a series of initiatives aimed at strengthening our ability to attract and retain talent, with efforts focused on the below key actions: Leadership development LeadPioneers is our Leadership development program that provides a structured approach to leadership, setting clear expectations and fostering a shared understanding of effective leadership practices. Through this program, we equip leaders with the skills they need to lead their people and organization in line with present and future demands. LeadPioneers offers two distinct learning tracks: Leading Others, tailored for leaders managing individual contributors, and Leading Leaders designed to educate leaders of other managers. Managed by the HR Development Team, LeadPio- neers trains leaders in cohorts throughout 2025, with an objective for all leaders with at least three direct reports to complete the program by third quarter of 2026. Expected outcomes include consistently enhancing leadership capabilities, establishing a culture prioritizing accountability, and a resilient leadership framework aligned with our strategic objectives. Performance management system Our Performance Management system is a manage- ment tool to align expectations between employees and managers. It facilitates collaboration, dialogue, and follow-up on individual performance and devel- opment goals. By supporting continuous engagement and alignment on deliverables and development plans, it contributes to achieving long-term organi- zational objectives. Integrated into annual HR processes, the perfor- mance management system ensures ongoing value through structured discussions and actionable outcomes. Expected benefits include improved performance tracking, focused development efforts, and enhanced alignment with organizational prior- ities. Targets Our people are the key to our success and although we have not formalized targets, we continuously monitor our performance in relation to talent attraction and retention, including work-life balance. This is done through various processes, including tracking turnover rates, employee engagement surveys, performance and development talks, lead- ership development program, one-on-one dialogue with managers, and exit-interviews.

"IRO Equal treatment and opportunities for all Given our global presence and reliance on a highly skilled workforce, we may risk our ability to attract and retain talent if we do not keep momentum in current efforts and continuously develop initiatives to ensure that we maintain an inclusive and diverse workforce. This risk is linked to our dependency on human resources and our ability to attract and retain talent, including risk considerations related to our reputation, legal sanctions, and/or labour disputes. Policies Diversity and inclusion policy Our Diversity and inclusion policy outlines our approach to ensuring equal treatment and oppor- tunities for all employees, which is a key compo- nent of our sustainability efforts. The policy aims to create a work environment where everyone feels respected and valued in support of a diverse workplace. The policy covers the following grounds for discrimination, but not limited to: gender, age, educational background, ethnicity, physical impair- ment, religion, or sexual orientation. The policy addresses material impacts such as elim- inating biases in selection and promotion processes and preventing discriminatory behavior. Executive Management is accountable for the imple- mentation of the diversity and inclusion policy. Global policy on sexual harassment and global policy on bullying and harassment at work We do not accept any kinds of bullying and harass- ment. Our policies stress the importance of respect and dignity while providing guidance on preventing and remediating inappropriate behaviors. Addition- ally, they emphasize the collective for cultivating a workplace where every individual feels safe, valued, and empowered to contribute fully. Maintaining a respectful workplace is a shared responsibility. All employees, including manage- ment, are accountable for adhering to the principles outlined in the policies. Members of the Executive Management are the most senior level account- able for the implementation of these policies. The policies are accessible for all employees via our intranet. We do not currently have specific policy commit- ments related to positive action for people from groups at particular risk of vulnerability Processes for remediation We are committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive, and respectful workplace where all employees are treated with dignity. We encourage employees to address concerns at the local level whenever possible. Employees who experience or witness inappropriate behavior should first attempt to resolve the issue by speaking with the individuals involved, their immediate manager, or a trusted colleague. If further support is needed, employees are urged to contact their HR Business Partner, who will facilitate resolution in line with company guidelines. In cases where local resolution is not possible, or if the concern involves a direct manager, employees may escalate the issue to a higher-level manager, a union or Workers Council representative or the Health and Safety Representative. We uphold a strict non-retaliation policy to protect employees who report concerns in good faith and continuously review our processes to ensure they remain effective, accessible, and aligned with regu- latory and ethical standards. Actions In 2024, we conducted two online programs as part of our ongoing commitment to educate employees on the importance of inclusion and unconscious bias. The sessions were focused on two key topics. 1. Inclusive Colleagueship - emphasizing the importance of inclusion, belonging, and allyship through practical, everyday actions; and 2. Unconscious Bias - exploring the impact of unconscious bias and impact on the workplace, providing strategies to mitigate bias. The sessions offered actionable insights on how employees contribute to an inclusive work environ- ment, emphasizing personal and collective respon- sibility in fostering an inclusive work environment. Targets Our people are the key to our success and although we have not formalized targets, we continuously monitor our performance in relation to equal opportunities and treatment. This is done through awareness trainings, salary benchmarks checks, and employee engagement surveys.

"IRO Health and safety We have processes in our manufacturing and research facilities that could pose a risk of nega- tive impact on a person’s physical health. This also applies to non-employees carrying out activities and services on our behalf. The negative impacts relate to individual incidents only for the part of our workforce that work in the context of our vaccines research and manufacturing. As this is an inherent part of our business model (end-to-end develop- ment and manufacturing of vaccines) decreasing the risk of negative impacts related to health and safety remains a priority on all our manufacturing and research facilities. The potential impacts described inform daily and strategic decision-making. Policies Global Environmental, Health & Safety Policy Our Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy covers all our business areas and locations. The policy emphasizes high standards of EHS performance, ensuring compliance with applicable EHS laws, managing EHS risks, and continuously seeking opportunities to reduce risks and improve performance. It highlights the importance of educating and enabling employees and key stakeholders inter- nally and externally to work safely and responsibly, fostering positive interactions and work practices through open dialogue on EHS matters. The EHS Management System, overseen by governance arrangements involving all company levels, ensures that performance is monitored and regularly reviewed to meet high standards and provide value to stakeholders. Site heads are responsible for implementing the policy and ensuring that it is effective. The content was revised during 2024, and the updated policy was published in the beginning of 2025. Employee vaccination program The policy aims to ensure health and safety of employees operating in environments with poten- tial exposure to infectious agents. It establishes protocols for vaccination for employees working in high-risk environments with live viruses. Objectives include protecting employees from health risks associated with exposure to infectious agents, implementing stringent access control to high-risk areas, aligning with global health and biosafety standards, thereby minimizing potential adverse impacts on physical health. The policy applies to all employees engaged in activities involving potential exposure to virus, including employees in production, quality control, environmental monitoring, and support roles operating in designated high-risk areas. The policy primarily addresses operations within our facilities, specifically activities directly involving the handling or production of hazardous biological materials. Engaging with our workforce We prioritize the health and safety of our employees through structured engagement processes with our workforce and their representatives. Our EHS Committee operates at the strategic level, collab- orating closely with Site Heads and the ESG repre- sentatives to plan, lead, and coordinate our efforts in protecting employee health and safety, the surrounding environment, and risk prevention. This committee ensures that strategic decisions align with our commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace. Engagement with our workforce occurs directly and through workers' representatives. This engage- ment is integral to our decision-making processes, ensuring that the perspectives of our workforce are incorporated into managing actual and potential impacts. Engagement occurs at multiple stages, including planning, implementation, and review phases of health and safety initiatives. The types of engagement include regular meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions, conducted frequently to ensure continuous dialogue and improvement. The Global EHS Director holds the overall respon- sibility for setting the strategic direction for EHS, aligning with each global function, while ensuring workforce engagement and feedback is the core of the strategy. The site heads have the overall responsibility, which is a legal requirement in most countries. Our Global EHS Operations team has been estab- lished at the operational level, working in collabo- ration with EHS Management to handle and partici- pate in risk prevention activities. These groups play a role in addressing unsustainable EHS matters, either by resolving them directly or escalating them to the EHS Committee. The EHS Committee act as a liaison between employees and the work environ- ment organization, ensuring effective communica- tion and collaboration. They are also responsible for providing comprehensive training and instruction to all employees, ensuring that everyone is well-in- formed about safety protocols and best practices. Where relevant, we incorporate specific considera- tions to vulnerable employees, including pregnant women. We have an internal policy that outlines specific tasks pregnant women should avoid to prevent any risk to their health and safety. This policy helps protect both the expectant mother and her unborn child by minimizing workplace hazards. The policy stipulates that specific individual risk assessments must be carried out for each pregnant worker. Where a potential risk is identified and cannot be eliminated, we will find alternative work arrangement, which will not impact the expectant or breastfeeding mother or unborn child.

Risk of a chaotic transition to low-carbon economy. Downstream investment portfolio Climate Risk Policy CAP: Active management of our climate action. No specific target FMO’s DMA, as described in 'ESRS 2 - Double materiality assessment', identified potential negative impacts through financed absolute emissions and potential positive impacts through investments in climate adaptation, climate mitigation and renewable energy as well as physical and transition risks. The Climate Risk Report and Climate Action Plan (CAP), both prepared in 2022, provided important input for determining FMO’s climate-related IROs. Impacts Both positive and negative impacts take place downstream in our investment portfolio. The impact of our own operations or those of our upstream suppliers are not considered material because of the small scale of emissions compared to those in our portfolio. The CAP describes how FMO actively monitors its activities and portfolio, thereby identifying actual and potential future GHG emission sources and other climate-related impacts within its operations and across its value chains. The intent of our data/ information collection drive is not only to use the information we gather for reporting and compliance purposes, but to actively manage our portfolio better, and to tailor our climate actions towards what is most effective. We will continue to work on improving our internal management and reporting systems to actively manage progress towards our sustainability goals. As part of our ESG management process we uphold IFC Performance Standard 3 (IFC PS3) (addressing resource efficiency and pollution prevention), which includes minimizing the pollution from project activities. When project related emissions are potentially significant, FMO requires its customers to adopt measures (e.g. use of renewable energy sources, sustainable agricultural, the reduction of fugitive emissions, etc.) that avoid or reduce emissions in order to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment (IFC PS3). FMO requires that projects implement technically and financially feasible and cost-effective measures for integrating emission reduction into product design and operational processes (IFC PS3). Specifically, ""this applies to the release of pollutants to air, water, and land due to routine, non- routine, and accidental circumstances with the potential for local, regional, and transboundary impacts."" Transboundary pollutants include those covered under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary 134 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Air Pollution, such VOCs that are key precursors in the formation of tropospheric ozone and particulate matter (of which black carbon is a significant component). This means that by upholding the IFC PS we indirectly screen investments for climate-related impacts, such as black carbon and tropospheric ozone. FMO reports on financed absolute emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3 in line with the GHG Protocol, as described in more detail in section 'E1-6 Gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions'. The financed absolute GHG emissions are reported in line with the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry published by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). Although emissions from FMO operations are not considered material, we will continue to report scope 1 and 2 emissions to be able to present a full picture of our GHG emission footprint. Risks & opportunities The material climate-related risks and opportunities for FMO occur both upstream and downstream in the investment portfolio. The climate-related risks identified in the DMA are aligned with internal risk assessment processes and documents. The assessment of climate risks happens on an ongoing basis at FMO. We run a portfolio scan on a quarterly basis that is reported to the Financial Risk Committee (FRC), which monitors our portfolio’s exposure to physical and transition risks. We also conduct materiality assessments which determine the potential for climate risk drivers to affect FMO’s portfolio or the entity itself. Both processes are discussed with the FRC. Furthermore, work is ongoing to embed climate risk assessments at the organizational level as well as within the investment cycle. The regular climate risk assessments inform the Financial Risk team’s decisions. Scenarios are considered and factors are stressed in FMO’s Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP and ILAAP), which are aligned with our regular Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) cycle. FMO’s physical climate risks were assessed over the current, medium and long-term using a high- emissions scenario and in line with guidelines from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ECB guide on Climate-related and Environmental Risks. While the climate risk assessment covers physical risks and transition risks, the various time horizons and high-emissions scenario were applied only to physical risks. FMO is currently working on further defining a methodology to assess transition risks that is suitable for the markets in which it operates. The climate risks associated with FMO’s investment portfolio are also described in FMO’s first climate risk report, which, as mentioned above, are aligned with the climate-related risks identified in the DMA. This report was written in line with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) requirements and shows that FMO’s portfolio is exposed to climate change risks, which will increase over time, with clear differences across locations, sectors and hazard types. This analysis, as well as those resulting from FMO’s ICAAP and ILAAP and continuous monitoring, served as input for the DMA, where additional transition risks (and opportunities) were identified. The climate scenarios used are currently independent of the financial models, as FMO currently does not include climate-related assumptions in the financial models. FMO will explore assessing possible inclusion of climate-related risks in our financial models based on expected credit losses. As part of our DMA, we identified a specific downstream (portfolio) risk related to water (E3) that we feel is better addressed under the risk of climate hazards here in E1: “There is a global risk of increased water scarcity due to climate change, increased water withdrawals and unsustainable water practices. This affects costs of production through higher water prices and leads to reduced crop yield and failure.” This is covered by the current climate hazards risk described in Table 14. Physical risks FMO plans to perform a physical risk assessment in line with the recommendations set out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ECB guide on Climate-related and Environmental Risks (ECB, 2021). For this reason we have developed a C&E risk assessment tool that supports the identification and monitoring of C&E risks at the customer level. The tool currently focuses mainly on physical climate risks. 135 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Various physical risks (flooding, temperature extremes, fire, water stress, drought, erosion, tropical cyclones and crop yield loss) are assessed based on a multiplication of hazard scores at specific locations or regions and sensitivity scores (specific to the sector/industry of the investment/business activity) to these hazards. The climate-related physical hazards have been identified over current-, medium- and long-term time horizons. For the physical climate risks, current-, medium- and long-term time horizons have been defined as follows: Current-term: 2011-2040 Medium-term: 2041-2070 Long-term: 2071-2100 These time horizons are different from the time horizons specified by the ESRS. The time horizons used are in line with standard practice in the climate science community, where climate refers to the long- term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years. In some cases, if the original data source did not overlap with these time horizons, the closest time period was chosen. The physical risk assessments are currently not tied to the lifetime of the exposure. Even if human-induced climate changes would not materialize in the near future under the climatological time horizon, foreseen changes may already affect investment decisions and other financial parameters today and therefore materialize earlier from a financial risk perspective, within the time horizons as specified by the ESRS. The ICAAP assessments consider climate risks over a period of three years. Physical risks hazards are estimated to affect FMO’s customers in various locations and sectors to different extents, according to the climate risk assessment. The physical risks assessed in the climate risk assessments were summarized as one physical risk in the DMA. The various physical risks for FMO’s relevant industries are assessed on an ongoing basis and reported through regular reviews within internal committees at portfolio level. To increase the granularity and understanding of these risks, FMO is currently in the process of rolling out physical climate risk assessments in the investment process, complementing the assessment at portfolio level as mentioned above. The scores for physical hazards were created for both acute and chronic hazard types under a high emissions or worst-case climate scenario, which is the IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario. RCP 4.5 was also considered, but the projections from RCP 8.5 cover a greater range of climate conditions, especially for the long-term time horizon. Furthermore, the temperature and rainfall changes are more intense under RCP 8.5, and the long-term projections from RCP 4.5 are quite similar to the medium-term projection from RCP 8.5. In conclusion, RCP 8.5 covers a wider range of climate conditions (more extremes) for the risk assessment, so we believe this is the more appropriate choice, as it better covers potential risks and uncertainties. RCP 8.5 makes the following assumptions about policies, macro-economic trends, energy usage and mix, and technology: Policy Assumptions: It assumes minimal or no additional climate policies beyond those already in place, leading to high GHG emissions. Macroeconomic Trends: The scenario includes assumptions about high population growth and relatively slow income growth. Energy Usage and Mix: It projects high energy demand with a continued reliance on fossil fuels, resulting in significant GHG emissions. Technology Assumptions: The scenario assumes modest rates of technological change and improvements in energy intensity, meaning that advancements in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies are not sufficient to offset the high energy demand. The scores for physical hazards were derived from climate models listed in the IPCC CMIP5 and CMIP6 protocols, where available. Each hazard was evaluated using a specifically chosen modeling method and simulated hazard exposure outputs from leading, peer-reviewed research institutions, and was further developed in partnership with well-known research institutions. The risk scores were created and standardized at an approximate 50x50 km spatial resolution as a level 1 detailed product. If grid location or country data was missing for an investment or loan, it was excluded from the analysis. Additionally, if 136 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"ILAAP assessments are aligned with FMO’s Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), which formulates the type and amount of risk that the bank is able and willing to accept in pursuit of its strategy. The 2023 version of the ICAAP and ILAAP assessments was the latest one that was part of a SREP. Some additional analyses took place in Q1 of 2024 based on feedback from DNB. Part of the input for the stress tests that were performed for this assessment cycle was based on a Climate Risk Analytics Methodology for FMO to identify material climate risks. Based on the assessment of physical risks by using this methodology, the countries and hazards with the highest severity and likelihood have been selected as input to the stress test. Transition risks have also been included, based on scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). Based on the outcomes of the DMA, the focus of FMO’s climate-related risks is on its investment portfolio rather than its own operations or upstream value chain. All material risks as identified in DMA were already included in the materiality assessment underlying the ICAAP and ILAAP assessments. The 2023 ICAAP and ILAAP assessments used 2022 as a base year to make a forecast for the period 2023 - 2025.The climate risk stress testing includes both physical and transition risks, based on established climate scenarios (IPCC, NGFS) to evaluate potential impact on FMO’s portfolio. The ICAAP and ILAAP assessment use stress testing scenarios that include macroeconomic factors, such as currency fluctuations and market volatility. A ‘disorderly transition’ scenario to a low-carbon economy has been formulated with help of experts, which has been used to evaluate potential transitions risks for FMO. This scenario assumed 1) policy & legal risks in the form of carbon pricing, asset stranding, and rising insurance costs, 2) technology and innovation risks in the form of advancements in renewable energy and battery technologies, 3) market risks resulting from changing consumer and market sentiments, and 4) reputation risks resulting from adverse reputational impacts, such as changing perceptions of financing high-carbon activities. The stress tests show that FMO is resilient to material climate risks. Both physical and transition risks under different scenarios have limited impact on liquidity and are within the risk appetite formulated by FMO. Additionally, FMO’s capital position remains adequate, and the excess capital remains robust under all circumstances simulated by the stress test scenarios. Specifically, the climate risks scenarios show that, despite the risks that are relevant for FMO and for the markets in which FMO operates, the impact on the capital position is estimated to remain limited. There were several limitations to the resilience analysis. First, the definition of the physical climate risks used include the fact that the risk definitions are ex-ante and model based, do not include potential adaptation measures, and use a top-down, national level approach. Reliability for these types of risks was further limited by the use of proxy data to fill in data gaps, applying averages over long time- periods, and not including all potential hazards. Secondly, with regards to transition risks, the risk assessment is predominantly based on qualitative information, reducing its systemization and comparability, and not allowing for granularity (e.g., at country-level). While there are inherent uncertainties to climate change and society’s response to it, FMO continues to improve its methodology and run (stress) scenario analyses to capture plausible but severe scenarios for the institution. As mentioned previously, the stress testing done for the resilience analysis is in line with FMO’s RAF. The RAF is monitored, managed and revised regularly to accommodate any market or organizational changes, and is reviewed by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board on an annual basis. If necessary, it can be revised on a semi-annual basis in case of material developments. The outcomes of the ICAAP and ILAAP assessments are used to formulate possible strategic responses. Climate- and environmental risks are inherently material to FMO’s business model & strategic risks, but this risk is also well managed by means of monitoring and reviewing of its business environment and strategic planning embedded within the organization and periodically reviewed with its stakeholders. Currently, the conclusion is that the risks to capital and liquidity related to climate change are well- managed by FMO and do not constitute a risk for the resilience of the business model. In addition to monitoring and managing risks, FMO has a pro-active investment strategy that contributes to climate adaptation and mitigation worldwide, also specifically aiming to increase the resilience of its customers, by engaging actively with them to define climate adaptation solutions and 138 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"providing technical assistance. How FMO implements this in practice will be elaborated on more in 'E1-3 Actions'. Through these actions, FMO not only aims to achieve a positive impact, but also increases resilience of the portfolio against both physical and transition risks. E1 ESRS 2 GOV-3 Integration of sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes As explained in 'ESRS 2 - Governance of sustainability matters', there is no direct relationship between sustainability-related elements, including climate, and remuneration elements in FMO's remuneration policy. Along with many other elements, climate-related performance only has an indirect effect on remuneration, even though it can contribute in part to individual annual performances. E1-1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation FMO does not have a formal transition plan, however, information included in this section is described in other relevant FMO documents. Two sets of actions, directly contributing to climate change mitigation, can be classified as decarbonization levers, as per the ESRS definition: 1. Aligning our portfolio and investments with the Paris Agreement goals. 2. Increasing climate investments and support to our customers. These levers are described in more detail in section 'E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies'. FMO has set a GHG emission reduction target: the Power Generation Emission Reduction Target. FMO aims to reduce emissions from financed scope 1 emissions in power generation by 50 percent in 2030. This target was developed using a 1.5°C pathway scenario (REMIND-MAgPIE 3.0-4.4, Scenario: Orderly - Net Zero 2050 scenario, electricity). More details on this target are provided in section 'E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation'. FMO has set the ambition in its 2030 Strategy to be Net Zero by 2050. In the short-term FMO will steer on aligning financial flows with 1.5°C aligned sectors and activities. FMO is also developing a Paris alignment methodology, based on internationally acknowledged guidelines and best practice. Over time, when data and methodologies have improved, FMO will use country- and sector-based 1.5°C pathways as guidance for the emission intensity requirements of its targets at portfolio and investments level. As a component of our climate action project workstream, we will continue to improve our data collection, including at the level of our customers, and use it to assess our progress. FMO recognizes that climate objectives should be carefully balanced with customer- and/ or location- specific social and environmental considerations, including the need for a just and inclusive transition and will further study how to treat potential tradeoffs in this regard. In addition, FMO invests in projects that contribute to GHG removals and storage, including forestry, and aims to grow forestry investments. The significant operational expenditures (OpEx) in the form of internal and external staff required for the implementation of the decarbonization levers are provided in section 'E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies', since they are aggregated for the implementation of the Climate Action Plan. The Climate Action Plan includes actions on both climate mitigation and adaptation. There are no material capital expenditures (CapEx) in the form of investments in FMO's own operations associated with the transition plan, as explained further below and in the section 'ESRS 2 - Our sustainability reporting approach'. FMO has no key (physical) assets in its own operations that materially contribute to climate change, nor do we sell any direct-use products. As such, no carbon lock-ins are expected to occur in the own operations of FMO under the definition provided in ESRS E1. In relation to the application of the lock-in definition for investments in the investment portfolio, as of today FMO does not have a definition of carbon lock-ins related to investments. FMO may have carbon- 139 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"intensive assets in its current portfolio, for example, via indirect investments through financial intermediaries in the Financial Institutions portfolio. However, mechanisms are in place to mitigate this risk in the investment portfolio. In this regard, a distinction between new and legacy investments should be made: 1. For new investments: The Combined Position Statement on Coal and Phasing Out Fossil Fuels excludes and screens out investments that are expected to have a high risk for future carbon lock in. FMO will use the Paris Alignment (PA) methodology to screen potential investments for alignment with the Paris Agreement. See section 'E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies' for more background on the PA methodology. 2. While there may be carbon-intensive assets locked in, in the current portfolio, the Power Generation Emission Reduction Target applies to both new and existing investments, thereby ensuring that the total emissions from investments in power generation will be reduced by 50 percent in 2030. See section 'E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation' for more information on the Power Generation target. In its current form, the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178, also known as the EU Taxonomy, is applicable for European economic activities. Since FMO invests outside Europe and entities based outside the EU are excluded from the numerator of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR), FMO reports a GAR of 0 percent. This implies that no key performance indicators from the EU Taxonomy can be linked to the resources required for the implementation of the actions described. More information is included in the 'EU Taxonomy' section. Based on FMO’s interpretation of as investments in physical assets in scope 1 and 2 of an organization, there is no CapEx to be identified as material for FMO. As a financial institution, FMO does not do climate-related investments in physical assets in its own operations that can be considered material (see 'ESRS 2 - Double materiality assessment'). FMO is awaiting guidelines or sector standards specifically for financial institutions for possible adaptation of the CapEx definition to financial institutions. FMO is not excluded from the EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks. The decarbonization levers presented are based on FMO’s 2030 Strategy and the CAP, i.e. the aims and actions described are embedded in FMO’s strategy. This is explained in more detail in the chapter on 'E1 Impact, risks, opportunities'. Details on the progress of each of the decarbonization levers are provided in 'E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies'. Details on the targets that are part of the decarbonization levers (e.g. the Power Generation Emissions Reduction target and €10 billion SDG 13 target) are provided in 'E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation'. The 2030 Strategy was approved by the Supervisory Board in 2022. The CAP was approved by the Management Board in 2022. E1-2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Our material IROs related to climate change are covered in the following two policies. 1. Sustainability Policy 2. Climate Risk Policy In the following sections, these policies are described in further detail. FMO’s commitments and actions on climate are described in the CAP and reported in 'E1-3 Actions'. All policies are subject to frequent revisions as per the Bank Risk Policy and are continuously evolving. Sustainability Policy FMO’s sustainability policy is mostly related to our (positive and negative) impacts and is described in more detail in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'. The Sustainability Policy encompasses FMO’s organizational activities, including energy consumption, resource utilization, travel practices, and new investments, addressing all products offered by FMO. As such, our Sustainability Policy covers how we manage the 140 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"climate-related impacts throughout our value chain. The Sustainability Policy is complemented by several position statements and an exclusion list. For climate change the most noteworthy include: Our Combined Position Statement on Coal and Position Statement on Phasing Out Fossil Fuels from our Investments reflects our approach to phasing out fossil fuels from our portfolio, both direct and indirect. Our Position Statement on Hydro Power Plants outlines our approach to investing in hydroelectric projects, emphasizing the balance between harnessing their economic and environmental benefits and rigorously assessing and mitigating potential technical and E&S impacts, including adherence to IFC PS and continuous monitoring. Our Position Statement on Impact and ESG for financial intermediaries outlines FMO’s structural approach to impact steering and ESG management in financial intermediary financing, including restricting our financial intermediary portfolio exposure to coal activities, and promoting and advising on green credit lines or green bonds that support climate action. Our exclusion list contains the activities, products, uses, distribution, business or trade that FMO and the borrower will not finance, extending to the borrowers’ shareholders, their affiliates and their subsidiaries. Additional major documents and processes that explain how material climate positive and negative impacts are managed are: The Paris alignment methodology, which describes our methodology for checking our new investments for alignment with the Paris goals, thereby helping our clients with the transition to become Paris aligned. ESG in the investment process: While the Sustainability Policy explains FMO’s ESG management process, this is operationalized via different internal documents such as the Risk Appetite Framework, Investment Criteria, and SIS manual. The Green Label Guidelines are used to assess eligibility of new investments for a ‘Green Label’. A Green Label is assigned based on the ex-ante potential of an investment in terms of its positive impact on our portfolio, including for instance the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, increasing resource efficiency, preserving and growing natural capital, and/or supporting climate adaptation. The label is not intended to monitor (ex post) impact. The Green Label thereby serves as a strategic steering tool and a proxy for FMO to measure progress against its €10 billion SDG 13 2030 target. In relation to the upstream value chain, an additional relevant document is the Sustainability Bonds Framework, which addresses the four key pillars of the ICMA ESG Bond Principles. The framework explains how FMO attracts private or public funds by issuing sustainable or green bonds in the capital market. Moreover, FMO aims to mobilize public and private capital and to create new bankable opportunities, as described in our 2030 Strategy. Climate Risk Policy The Climate Risk Policy covers our climate-related risks in the entire value chain. Complementing this policy, the climate risk methodology explains how we identify the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. All policies are subject to frequent revisions as per the Bank Risk Policy and are therefore continuously evolving. The Climate Risk Policy aims to: 1. Define climate risk in terms of physical and transition risk drivers. 2. Introduce the approach used to identify climate risks in all FMO’s operations, products, and services. 3. Define the roles and responsibilities related to climate risk identification, assessment, and action. 141 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Table 15. Minimum Disclosure Requirements for Climate Risk Policy Scope of policy The policy applies to the FMO-A portfolio (both on and off-balance sheet) and to FMO-managed government funds. It has a specific focus on assessing and managing climate risks related to FMO's loan and equity investments. In 2025, the scope and name of the policy will be expanded from a climate risk policy to a climate- related and environmental financial risk policy. Accountable body The document is approved by the FRC after consultation via the ISCO and owned by Risk. Implementation is currently managed via an internal project and related implementation oversight is performed by the Steering Committee of the project. Third-party standards/ initiatives (if relevant) The document was developed in the light of the ECB Guide on climate-related and environmental risks. Consideration to interests of key stakeholders (if relevant) No key external stakeholders were consulted upfront in this process, but the policy has been shared with DNB for information afterwards. Availability to stakeholders (if relevant) This is an internal policy and the document is therefore not publicly available. With regards to climate change mitigation, FMO manages material IROs through several processes. Most importantly, through our Green Label guidelines, with which we aim for our portfolio to materially contribute to climate mitigation, reduction of GHG emissions and/or increasing sequestration of GHG emissions from the atmosphere (along with adaptation and energy efficiency, as described below). FMO’s Green Label definition is based on the Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking, as defined by the Multilateral Development Banks. All Green-labelled investments should meet FMO’s Green Principles, namely that Green-labelled investments contribute to a genuine improvement and should not contribute to a long-term lock-in of high carbon infrastructure. A genuine improvement implies that 1) the improvement goes beyond the local regulatory requirements 2) the improvement is unrelated to local resources stress and 3) the improvement is sustainable throughout the value chain of an industry or a business. The implementation of our Paris Alignment methodology will contribute to further aligning our new investments to the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, as per our combined Position Statement on Coal and Phasing Out Fossil Fuels, FMO will not invest in any upstream coal mining activities, transportation of coal, construction or renovation of a coal producing plant, or other associated business or infrastructure. Other fossil fuels are only invested in the exceptional case that a transition phase is deemed necessary to improve a country’s energy accessibility. The combined position statement applies to both direct and indirect investments of FMO. The SBF sets out a list of climate change mitigation activities eligible for the sustainability bonds issued. The Climate Risk Policy includes components such as knowledge and awareness development, embedding climate risk in the organization's strategy, governance, risk appetite determination, policy adjustments, stress testing, climate risk assessment methodology development, and internal and external reporting. FMO manages its knowledge components and supports customers primarily via technical assistance. Investment teams are responsible for assessing climate risks and it is at their discretion to discuss the outcomes with clients. The Risk department maintains the methodology and supports knowledge development across the organization. Besides climate mitigation, FMO also aims to contribute to climate adaptation. Most notably, we do this through our Green Label, through which we label those investments that ex ante are expected to positively contribute to climate adaptation. For a customer or an activity to be eligible for a Green Label in this category, it needs to be assessed to meet the climate adaptation principles set by the IFC-MDB joint methodology for climate change adaptation. This means that climate change adaptation is defined as achieving climate resilience outcomes in response to relevant climate change impacts, by managing or reducing physical climate risks, reducing the underlying causes of vulnerability and avoiding maladaptation. 142 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Our Paris Alignment methodology further aims to ensure a minimum level of resilience for Paris alignment. Our physical Climate Risk Assessment underpins our climate adaptation label analysis. The SBF sets out a list of climate change adaptation activities eligible for the sustainability bonds. Following the EDFI Statement on Climate and Energy Finance and as part of our Climate Action Plan, FMO aims to finance initiatives that contribute to adaptation and resilience to climate change, especially in respect of vulnerable communities and natural ecosystems. Improving energy efficiency is one of the ways by which FMO strives to remain climate neutral in all its operational activities. FMO looks to build-up a portfolio that is targeted at improving access to basic services, such as energy, and aiming to optimally use scarce resources. Energy efficiency is seen as a form of climate change mitigation when assessing activities according to the Green Label Guidelines: at least 20 percent reduction in energy consumption or GHG emissions is required for it to comply with that category. Through our E&S practices, we apply IFC PS3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention, which is specific for water and pollution (e.g. air, noise, water) related impacts and for opportunities on efficiencies (e.g. energy or water). This also involves the issuance of sustainability bonds used to finance renewable energy and improve energy. Regarding renewable energy deployment, following the EDFI Statement on Climate and Energy Finance, our Sustainability Policy states that FMO is committed to increase its share of investment that contributes to low-carbon, reliable and affordable energy. As described previously, through our Green Label and Position Statements, we aim to increase our portfolio’s share of contribution to renewable energy deployment and avoid investments in non-renewables respectively. Also, investing in renewable energy is central to our Energy sector strategy, which is one of the three core sectors in which FMO invests. Finally, FMO aims to increase the volume of investments in biodiversity and forestry, to remove carbon and increase resilience. For further information please refer to 'E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems'. E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies The three main actions to operationalize FMO’s 2030 Strategy in relation to climate are as follows: 1. Aligning our portfolio and investments with the Paris Agreement goals. 2. Increasing climate investments and support to our customers. 3. Active management of our climate action. Details regarding these actions are described in the following sections. Aligning our portfolio and investments with the Paris Agreement goals This action consists of the following sub-actions: 1. Reduce emissions in our investments, so that in 2050 our portfolio’s aggregate absolute emissions, when added with our carbon removal investments’ negative emissions, result in net zero emissions. We will strive to align the overall portfolio emission reductions with aggregate country- and sector- specific 1.5oC emission reduction pathways, taking into account a just and inclusive transition. At FMO we recognize that a starting point for Paris alignment are the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans, and while we will seek to align our investments with these plans, we also seek to raise the ambition level of our customers and strive toward 1.5oC pathway alignment. 143 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"2. Reduce power generation portfolio emissions by 50 percent to 2030, while at the same time approximately doubling our sustainable power generation portfolio and overall energy portfolio. We will consider additional targets in other parts of the portfolio. 3. Assess new investments for Paris alignment from a climate mitigation and resilience perspective, by implementing an investment-level Paris alignment assessment for new transactions. 4. Implement our commitment under the EDFI Climate and Energy Statement regarding fossil fuels in our indirect investments, and consider other policies that support our goals. FMO has a dedicated project allocated to the implementation of this action. Since 2023, FMO has a dedicated workstream focused on developing a Paris alignment methodology and further developing our in-house capacity. In 2024 FMO finalized its Paris alignment methodology, based on the MDB Principles for Paris Alignment. This methodology will be used to assess new investments for Paris alignment from a mitigation and resilience perspective and was piloted in 2024 based on which the methodology was further refined and finalized. The Paris alignment assessment methodology will be rolled out in the coming period and once ready, will be used to assess new transactions. Additionally, FMO will work further towards an approach for striving towards 1.5-degree alignment and develop climate mitigation KPIs for progress measurement. The overall action can be classified as a decarbonization lever, since the sub-actions will reduce emissions in FMO's investment portfolio, thereby mitigating climate change. The target of reducing power generation emissions by 50 percent in 2030 is part of this action. This target – together with performance on expected and achieved GHG reductions - is elaborated in section 'E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation'. Increasing climate investments and support to our customers This action is made of by the following sub-actions: 1. Building up a portfolio of at least €10 billion dedicated to SDG 13 goals in climate mitigation, adaptation & resilience (including nature-based solutions), biodiversity, and other footprint reduction. We do this by engaging with customers such as our financial institutions to encourage their further investments in these objectives, through activities that contribute to developing our markets (market creation), and by mobilizing additional capital to closing the financing gap needed in emerging markets. 2. Increasing our climate mitigating investments and investments that contribute to solutions for adaptation, resilience and biodiversity, thereby strengthening our customers’ resilience to climate change. Examples of what this entails, include: Corporate governance advisory work focused on climate governance and climate risk, building on the work we have done in this area to date. Technical assistance funding, building on platforms like our Green Finance Framework. Engagement with portfolio companies and new customers to influence them to set targets and transition plans to reduce their emissions over time, or at a minimum to consider technical solutions together. Supporting green finance innovation in our investments. Active shareholdership by ensuring our investees are prepared for both climate risks and opportunities. Creating coalitions with key nature conservation organizations, contributing to the understanding of the landscape approach, and promoting community and stakeholder engagement. 3. Provide sector-specific solutions for energy, financial institutions, and agriculture and forestry. Regarding energy, FMO will continue financing utility scale clean energy generation projects (solar, wind both on- and offshore, hydro power and geothermal), with an increased attention towards the least developed countries (LDCs) and fragile states. These efforts will be an important driver behind our climate mitigation and resilience goals. Towards 2030, through sector initiatives, partner engagement, and other means, we will work to remove bottlenecks currently slowing down the sustainable energy transition in some of our markets. We will also work toward sustainable energy access and inclusion, while further scaling both already established / proven and innovative technologies and solutions. 144 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"For financial institutions, FMO will increasingly aim to have a ‘transformative’ impact on customers through a strategic approach including the development of product propositions, capabilities, and related financing with the goal of having the same effect on end beneficiaries. Finally, regarding agriculture and forestry, our focus will remain on strengthening local agricultural and food supply chains for both local or regional markets to increase local production and reduce reliance on imports, to improve local access to nutritious food, and to reduce food waste (e.g. through more and improved storage and distribution). We continue our focus on decent work and economic inclusion of the bottom 40 percent of income distribution, including smallholder farmers and women. Towards 2030, emphasis will be on engagement and investing more in global merchants, input providers and food companies with leverage to increase sustainable practices, along the (international) agricultural supply chains. We will continue expanding our integral/ landscape approach to supporting and investing in sustainable land-use and ecosystem protection and restoration, among others, through our work on forestry (carbon sequestration), climate smart and regenerative agriculture, soil improvements and livelihoods. 4. Continue to invest in carbon removals, specifically forestry, and help build these markets. More details on this are provided in the section 'E1-7 GHG Removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits'. 5. Contribute to our impact portfolio growth objectives through our market creation efforts and scale our activities through our mobilization efforts. In order to advance our impact contributions (including for climate action), through ‘market creation’ we aim to develop unbankable opportunities into bankable projects, as well as drive topics and business models of the future. We aim to accelerate impact by upscaling mobilization of private and public capital by aiming to double this portfolio by 2030 through: Developing climate fund propositions for large scale mobilization, following a just and inclusive transition approach, targeting both climate impact and social impact. Blending public and commercial funding for high-impact propositions in LDCs. Exploring possibilities for equity mobilization. Strengthening syndication efforts by increasing sourcing capacity of transactions, and by expanding and diversifying our investor base. 6. Engaging with our customers to increase their Paris alignment and provide them with technical assistance and other support. This will include helping to develop climate governance and climate risk frameworks and tools to work with their clients. We will specifically start with pan-regional customers as agents of change, gradually expanding to all customers over time. FMO’s Green Label Methodology was updated in 2023 by the Sustainability Strategy and Policy team (established in 2023), following updated Multilateral Development Banks common principles for climate mitigation finance tracking. FMO has also established a Sustainable Finance Advisory team to support investment teams with Green deal origination. This team reached its full size at the end of 2023 and initiated work with the sectors in 2024. On advancing sector-specific solutions for energy, financial institutions, and agriculture and forestry, in 2024, FMO developed a climate framework for Technical Assistance (TA) to the Private Equity and Agribusiness, Food and Water sectors. Through the climate framework, FMO is able to offer customers in the Private Equity and Agribusiness, Food and Water sectors TA on climate adaptation and mitigation. This includes climate awareness training, climate risk assessments, GHG measurement and reporting, climate action planning and implementation, climate opportunity origination, and compliance with sustainability standards. As part of our ambition to continue to invest in carbon removals, specifically forestry, and help build these markets, FMO has investment officers specialized in forestry in various investment teams. Under market creation, FMO has defined four focus themes: financial inclusion and resilience for entrepreneurs, responsible energy transition, forestry and sustainable land-use, and food system transformation. In 2024, we worked in particular on operationalizing and building out the financial inclusion theme. 145 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"The overall action can be classified as a decarbonization lever, since it will contribute to reducing emissions, thereby mitigating climate change. However, no GHG emission reduction target is linked to this action. Active management of our climate action This action is comprised of a set of sub-actions: 1. Monitor our work at a portfolio level, including absolute and relative emission levels. In order to achieve the impact we aim for, having the right data and additional information needed for measuring and steering our work will be key. 2. Continue to improve data quality and collection, including at the level of our customers. Data collection in our markets and for our specific customer types is not always readily available, especially for investments in smaller companies and for financial institutions and funds, which need to obtain data from their clients. To tackle this challenge, together with our development finance institution partners, we launched the Joint Impact Model (JIM) in 2021. The JIM allows us to model the emissions in the absence of emission data, to have an indication of our portfolio emissions. 3. Adopt an adaptive management approach and adjust our actions based on data and information. The intent of our data/information collection drive is to not only use the information we gather to report and for compliance purposes, but to also better actively manage our portfolio and tailor our climate actions to what is most effective. Moving forward, we will continue to work on improving our systems. 4. Implement a climate risk framework to manage the portfolio for both physical and transition climate risk. Integrating climate risk at FMO is about ensuring that risks to our portfolio due to climate change (physical and transition risks) are structurally identified, assessed, and managed. It is also about bringing this knowledge to our customers and structuring our transactions with the same considerations. Ultimately managing climate risk is another way to drive the change we want to see in our markets. The implementation of this action is mainly covered via a project. In 2024, FMO made progress in developing transition and physical risk assessment methodologies for assessing climate risk. Physical risk assessment tooling is currently implemented for all sectors. Furthermore, FMO established a climate risk policy as well as a quarterly portfolio scan as part of the climate risk framework. FMO also continued work on improving data quality and collection. For the first time, FMO reported the PCAF score for the tracking of emissions data quality. FMO will further work on transition risk assessment and improving data quality and management. FMO will also aim to refine emissions data to better take into account known use-of-proceeds instruments, i.e., when the investment is allocated to specific assets of a customer. While this action aims to enhance FMO’s management of climate actions, such as creating more awareness via enhanced data and methodologies, the overall action cannot be classified as a decarbonization lever since it does not directly contribute to GHG reduction. Table 16. Minimum Disclosure Requirement applicable for all presented actions Scope of actions The actions apply to FMO's value chain, with a focus on the downstream value chain. No actions regarding FMO's own operations are included, as these were found to be not material in the DMA.

"As explained in section 'E1-1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation', no key performance indicators from the EU Taxonomy can be linked to the resources required for the implementation of the actions described. More information is provided in the 'EU Taxonomy' section. E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation FMO has two targets related to the Policies and Actions described in the sections 'E1-2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation' and 'E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies' respectively. Table 14 presented in the 'E1 Impacts, risks and opportunities' section shows which target relates to which IRO, policy and/or action. The table, therefore, indicates for each action whether there is a related target, thereby specifying whether and how the effectiveness of these actions are quantitatively tracked. Firstly, a GHG emission reduction target has been set in the form of the Power Generation Emission Reduction target. The target is set to reduce the financed scope 1 emissions in the power generation portfolio by 50 percent in 2030. Given the baseline value of 624 ktCO2e, this would imply an absolute reduction of 312 ktCO2e. This target will specifically contribute to reducing the financed absolute GHG emissions, i.e. the GHG emissions in scope 3 category 15 (Investments). The target has the same reporting boundary as the financed absolute GHG emissions. In 2024, the power generation portfolio emissions are 442 ktCO e, which is 42 percent of the financed scope 1 emissions and 8 percent of total financed absolute GHG emissions. In line with the ‘Financial Sector Climate Commitment Guideline on relevant financing, investments and action plans’ FMO has prioritized target setting for its power generation portfolio, being an emission-intensive sector. Secondly, a strategic target has been set in the form of the €10 billion SDG 13 target. FMO aims to have developed a portfolio of at least €10 billion in investments dedicated to SDG 13 goals by 2030. An ex- ante assessment is made to assess an investment’s potential impact and its related contribution to SDG 13, determining eligibility to receive the Green Label. The Green Label includes positive impact contributions to for instance climate change mitigation and adaptation and biodiversity. While it is no direct emission reduction target, the Green Label as a tool to steer towards FMO’s €10 billion SDG 13 target will contribute to reduced emissions in FMO’s investments portfolio and overall positive impact to SDG 13. Detailed information on this target is provided in 'ESRS 2 – IRO management'. Since the Power Emission Reduction Target is the only target related to GHG emission reduction, disclosures requirements focusing on emission reductions are only applicable to this target. Table 14 in the 'E1 Impact, risks and opportunities' section indicates to which IRO the Power Generation Emission Reduction Target and the €10 billion SDG 13 target relates to. Table 17 provides information on the Power Generation Emission Reduction target, whereas the relevant details for the €10 billion SDG 13 target are presented in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'. Table 17. Minimum Disclosure Requirement for Power Generation Emission Reduction Target Target level to be achieved and unit of measurement, and clarification whether target is absolute or relative (where applicable) 50 percent emission reduction in FMO's financed Scope 1 power generation emissions by 2030. Scope of target The power generation target GHG emissions include active investments that have production of electricity (NACE code 35.11) as their main economic activity. They are calculated based on customers’ Scope 1 emissions, attributed in line with the PCAF Global Standard. The outstanding amounts include FMO-A, public funds and mobilized capital.

"Methodologies and assumptions The target is based on a calculated 1.5oC pathway provided by the REMIND-MAgPIE 3.0-4.4 database, using the Orderly - net zero 2050 scenario for electricity. This scenario is broken down by region, and country income level (upper middle income, lower middle income, low income using World Bank categorization) within regions, using our best estimate of proxies where there is no perfect match. The REMIND-MAgPIE 3.0-4.4 database is a scenario of the NGFS, which has as its goal meeting the goals of the Paris agreement. REMIND-MAgPIE is a comprehensive Integrated Assessment Model that simulates the dynamics within and between the energy, land use, water, air pollution and health, economy, and climate systems. It has been assumed that the portfolio distribution at country-income level will remain constant up to 2030 compared to 2021. Moreover, power production growth projections are based on 2030 Strategy projections, including direct mobilized funds (average of ~8.0 percent p.a. between 2021-2030). Thereafter, a projection of 4 percent per year is used. For renewable energy customers without reported emissions data, the assumption is made that their scope 1 emissions are zero. Target related to environmental matters is based on conclusive scientific evidence (if applicable) The REMIND-MagPIE scenario is based on the SSP2 scenario defined by the IPCC. Stakeholder involvement with target setting The target has been set as part of the CAP, and while taking into consideration the expectations following FMO’s commitment to the Financial Sector commitment to the Dutch Climate Agreement. The CAP was discussed both formally and informally with key stakeholders during drafting. Changes in target We include only scope 1 emissions, as this is the primary emission driver of power generation plants. For renewable energy customers without reported emissions data, the assumption is made that their scope 1 emissions are zero. In order to compare performance year-on-year, data is aligned according to reporting year to the extent possible. Given that this annual report is published in early 2025, not all 2024 customer data (e.g. emissions data) was available. As a result, the reported 2024 power generation emissions combines 2023 customer emissions data with 2024 portfolio data from FMO (e.g. outstanding amounts). The 2024 number will be finalized in next year’s annual report. The 2023 power generation emissions are, in principle, finalized in this annual report with a value of 510 ktCO2e, based on 2023 portfolio data and 2023 customer data. The baseline for the power generation target is restated in this Annual Report in line with the recalculation approach. The new baseline number is 624 ktCO2e (previous value was 582 ktCO2e). The reason is that emission factors were updated in an internal calculation tool. In order to ensure consistency between baseline and later years, emissions data for 2021 and 2022 was retroactively adjusted for customers where the tool was used – note the tool is not used if customers directly reported emissions. Performance The power generation target GHG emissions were 442 ktCO e in 2024, which is a 29 percent reduction compared to the 2021 baseline. The reduction is due to an overall decrease of our outstanding exposure in operational fossil fuel plants. FMO has set a GHG emission reduction target for financed scope 1 emissions in the power generation portfolio, as described in E1-4. While FMO aims to be net zero by 2050, FMO has not yet set other reduction targets for financed scope 1, 2 and 3, therefore no information and data can be provided regarding such targets. This is due to the many unknowns ahead including how climate change itself will evolve, how our markets and customers will respond, lack of data and what solutions are needed and effective. We seek to carefully balance our climate objectives with customer- or location-specific social and environmental considerations, including the need for a just and inclusive transition. FMO will focus in the short-term on striving to align financial flows with 1.5oC aligned activities and is working on an approach to measure this. FMO will consider setting additional targets to further align financial flows. We will continue to improve our data collection, including at the level of our customers, and use it to assess and monitor our progress, as a component of our climate action project workstream. The progress made regarding the Power Generation Reduction Emission Target has been disclosed in table 17. The baseline value is considered representative as there are no indications that for the power generation portfolio the activities covered and influences from external factors in the base year were significantly different to other years. Table 17 provides information on the scientific base used to define the Power Generation Emission Reduction Target. Since no other targets for GHG emission reduction exist, no other progress can be disclosed, nor can information be provided on how it has been ensured that the baseline value of such targets is representative in terms of activities covered and influences from external factors. 2 148 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"The decarbonization levers of FMO are defined in the section ' E1-1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation'. The Power Generation Emission Reduction target is part of the lever ‘Aligning our portfolio and investments with the Paris Agreement goals’. Refer to table 17 for information on the quantitative contribution to GHG emission reduction and the definition of the target, for which one scenario has been used. The €10 billion SDG 13 target is part of the decarbonization lever ‘Increasing climate investments and support to our customers’, supporting mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. Because of the nature of this target, no quantitative contribution to GHG emission reduction can be provided for this target. More details on how the decarbonization levers and targets relate is provided in table 14 in the 'E1 Impacts, risks and opportunities' section. E1-6 Gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions Table 18 provides the previous year and the reporting period's emissions. The previous year emissions were restated in line with our recalculation approach. The previously reported value for the total financed GHG absolute emissions (8,403 ktCO2e) was recalculated to 5,468 ktCO2e. The decrease is mainly due to the use of a new JIM version (3.1.6), which includes updated economic emissions factors based on an updated GTAP database. Compared to the restated previous year emissions, total GHG emissions increased in the reporting period mainly due to an extended methodological coverage for scope 3 category 15 GHG emissions (i.e. sector breakdown adjustments). For more details, please refer to the ‘FMO methodology for reporting financed GHG emissions and jobs’, available on FMO’s website. Even though emissions in scope 1 and 2 from FMO’s own operations were found not to be material, these have been added for completeness and consistency with previously reported emissions. Milestones and targets have not been defined and are therefore left blank. FMO did set a target to reduce emissions in its power generation portfolio, which is described in section 'E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation'. The excluded scope 3 categories are indicated in the following table with ‘N/A’. These categories are excluded because they are not expected to be material for FMO. The upstream scope 3 categories 1-5 are not relevant as they only pertain to goods and serviced purchased for FMO’s one office building, scope 3 category 8 is not applicable as upstream leased assets (e.g. vehicles and building) are included under Scope 1 and 2, and the downstream scope 3 categories 9-14 are not applicable because FMO’s operations do not include sold physical products, downstream leased assets or franchises.

"No significant changes have taken place in the definition of what constitutes the reporting undertaking and its value chain. The financed emission calculations have benefitted from data improvements and methodological refinements compared to the previous Annual Report. The adjustments are elaborated upon in the FMO methodology for reporting financed GHG emissions and jobs, which is available on FMO’s website. FMO follows the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard to report its GHG emissions scopes 1, 2 and 3. The absolute GHG emissions from FMO’s own operations are calculated based on measured data collected internally, such as information on commuting and flights and heating consumption of the FMO office in The Hague. To report on the scope 3 category 15 emissions (i.e. the financed absolute GHG emissions), FMO follows the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry published by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF).26 The reporting boundary includes the debt and equity portfolio at the time of reporting. The majority of FMO’s financed absolute GHG emissions are estimated through economic modelling using the Joint Impact Model (JIM). For more details, please refer to the FMO methodology for reporting financed GHG emissions and jobs, which is available on FMO’s website. The JIM version used in this sustainability statement has not been externally validated. The upcoming JIM version is undergoing an external validation process, but the planned release of that version was not in time for this report. Emissions are reported for the entire portfolio based on the actual results of the investments using the most recent data available. For the Annual Report 2024, this means that numbers reflect annual results of investments for 2024 to the extent that information is available, and otherwise 2023 (or older) numbers. Emissions are recorded per year. In other words, if the reporting date of the client is 31 March 2024, the data is reported for the year 2024 and similarly for customers where the reporting date is 31 December 2024. When investments are no longer in the portfolio as of 31 December 2024, we no longer include emissions of these customers. Information about the percentage of different contractual instruments within scope 2 is not provided, since scope 2 emissions were found to be non-material by the DMA. The percentage of financed emissions calculated using primary data is disclosed in table 19a and 19b. The tables also include information on the coverage percentage and the PCAF data quality score. Biogenic emissions of CO2 from combustion or bio-degradation of biomass that occur in value chain are included in the gross scope 3 emissions, as data limitations do not allow to disclose these separately. This is the first year that FMO reports on its GHG emissions per net revenue. As such, no comparative value or marginal change is provided in table 20. The net revenue figure was calculated by summing the line items 'Interest income from financial instruments measured at AC', 'Interest income from financial instruments measured at FVPL', 'Dividend income', 'Fee and commission income' and 'Remuneration for services rendered' from the financial statements (see 'Consolidated statement of profit or loss' in the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' chapter).

"Validation by external body other than the assurance provider (if applicable) NA Unit Number 2024 0 admissible complaints 2023 0 admissible complaints Stakeholder engagement and outcomes We are in constant dialogue with various stakeholders. Throughout the years, at a corporate level we have taken the outcomes of stakeholder engagement into account in, among other things: FMO’s strategy development (2030 Strategy: Pioneer-Develop-Scale) FMO’s double materiality assessment FMO’s Sustainability Policy FMO’s position statements FMO’s Customer Disclosure Policy The Independent Complaints Mechanism FMO’s Climate Action Plan (CAP) During the development of our long-term 2030 Strategy Pioneer – Develop – Scale we consulted internal stakeholders (including FMO’s employees) and external stakeholders. For this consultation, meetings were held with the Dutch Ministry of Finance, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DNB, NGOs, (E)DFIs, private banks, commercial finance partners, and the European Commission (EC). At the start of the strategic development process, FMO collected the key topics and expectations of these stakeholders, which was part of the foundation for the further development of the long-term strategy. The Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance provided their vision during various stages of the strategy development process. During the materiality assessment, FMO takes the views and interests of stakeholders into account. We do this either by consulting them directly or integrating knowledge about stakeholder interests coming out of regular stakeholder engagement activities as described in this section. When developing or updating policy statements, we invite stakeholders to give their views on new policies and position statements that guide our investment process and decision-making. For example, in 2016, we developed a comprehensive Sustainability Policy, taking into account more than 300 comments from various parties from society, government and customers. We are active participants in a number of multi-stakeholder dialogues. At an investment level, the outcomes of stakeholder engagement are taken into account via our due diligence process. Stakeholder and community engagement is a key principle embedded within the IFC PS. This means that FMO is committed to actively engaging with affected stakeholders and local communities throughout the project lifecycle in order to understand their concerns, incorporate their perspectives into decision-making processes, and mitigate any negative impacts on them. On an ad-hoc basis, FMO also engages with value chain workers as part of its monitoring. For more information refer to section 'ESRS 2 - IRO management' and specific information on this type of stakeholder engagement in the sections 'S2-2 Processes for engaging with value chain workers', 'S3-2 Processes for engaging with affected communities' and 'S4-2 Processes for engaging with consumers and end-users'. The Integrity and Issue Management Committee (IIMC) is a sub-committee of the Non-Financial Risk Committee (NFRC) and is appointed by the Management Board. The IIMC monitors and advises on designated projects, transactions, and customers on a corporate and project level, including where applicable complaints related matters brought forward via the ICM for proposed, active and completed/ exited investments. The Management Board is informed of the views and interests of FMO project affected stakeholders on a case-by-case basis and the Supervisory Board (through the Management Board) via quarterly periodic briefs. For example, when there is a material impact voiced via 1) ex-ante (prior to commitment) disclosure questions; 2) NGO questions; or 3) (ongoing) complaints with the ICM. 117 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"FMO regularly conducts employee surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement levels. For more information on how we engage with our employees please refer to the sub-chapter 'S1 - Own Workforce'. Future steps towards our stakeholder dialogues In 2024, we worked on an outline policy for effective dialogue with the relevant corporate stakeholders, which will be published as a position statement in the first quarter of 2025. This policy will enable FMO to effectively decide: (i) if engagement is needed for specific topics, (ii) which stakeholders should be involved, (iii) what the timelines are for this engagement process and (iv) how the process should be organized. Currently, the ICM Policy is being revised. Input from stakeholders will be sought by a public consultation of the draft policy, to enhance and clarify the policy and increase the trust and buy-in of stakeholders. Advocacy NGOs are especially interested in the ICM because they use it to escalate their complaints. NGOs that have requested to be able to provide input at an early stage – before public consultation – have been engaged with to share their views. ESRS 2 IRO management FMO manages material sustainability-related matters, including material impacts, risks and opportunities, through various policies and actions. Material impacts, risks and opportunities identified for S1 and G1 relate to FMO's own operations and are, therefore, managed by FMO's Human Resources and Compliance departments. Material impacts, risks and opportunities identified for E1, E3, E4, S2, S3 and S4 relate to FMO's customers and investments (downstream value chain) and are managed as part of our investment process. In addition, FMO has developed an impact management framework to ensure it takes an integrated approach to managing positive and negative impacts – potential and actual – as well as the financial risks that may result from the negative impacts in its investment portfolio. Our management approach to our own workforce and business conduct are described in the S1 and G1 topical statements, respectively. Our approach to impact management is common across E1, E3, E4, S2, S3 and S4 and is described in the following section. Negative impacts and the resulting financial risks are managed through ESG management practices. Negative impacts on people and the environment could result in financial risks, leading to, for example, financial (remediation, legal) costs to FMO or its customer, jeopardize access to capital for FMO (from external investors), jeopardizing the license to operate, jeopardizing shareholder relations or reputational damage. This is further described in the paragraphs relating to ESG management. Positive impacts are managed through allocating and structuring capital towards the SDGs, mostly through our Reducing Inequalities (RI) and Green Labels. This is further described in the paragraphs relating to impact management. Figure 2. Impact management framework Strategy and policy FMO’s impact and sustainability commitments are outlined in FMO’s Sustainability Policy, which was first approved by FMO’s Management Board in 2016. The policy is complemented by our exclusion list, 118 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"position statements on – among other things – human rights, land governance, fossil fuels and coal, and impact and ESG for financial intermediaries. Together, these documents form the Sustainability Policy Universe (SPU), available on our website. FMO requires, that all customers comply with applicable environmental, social and human rights laws in their home and host countries. In addition, FMO upholds (inter)national standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the Client Protection Principles (CPPs). In addition, FMO has adopted the IFC PS (2012) as its operating standard. FMO requires its customers to comply with these standards and in doing so to identify, prevent and mitigate negative social and environmental impacts. FMO’s Sustainability Policy and position statements apply to all our new investments. This includes both direct investments and investments through financial intermediaries. This policy is the foundation of our impact management framework and provides guidance for FMO’s internal processes. FMO considers this policy a living document. It will be updated based on lessons learned and input from FMO’s stakeholders. Our Sustainability Policy and position statements undergo targeted and public consultation with various relevant stakeholder groups (e.g. the Dutch government, DFI partners, (commercial) peers, (inter)national Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and think tanks, and relevant (industry) standard organizations) during the development process and every three years, are formally approved by the Management Board. Table 6. Minimum disclosure requirements for FMO’s Sustainability Policy Scope of policy The scope of this policy extends to FMO’s entire footprint. This includes FMO’s activities at the organizational level and new investments with respect to all products provided by FMO. The nature of the services FMO delivers can in some situations limit FMO’s level of influence. FMO will then apply this policy to the greatest extent possible. This Policy is the foundation of our sustainability management and provides guidance to FMO’s internal processes. This Sustainability Policy is the leading part of a broader Sustainability Policy Universe (see Annex 1 of the Policy) that also encompasses thematic and sectoral Position Statements that complement the Sustainability Policy and give further depth and content to the choices FMO makes. Accountable body Management Board with approval delegated to Impact and Sustainability Committee (ISCO) Third-party standards/initiatives (if relevant) As part of the Sustainability Policy, FMO upholds various (inter)national standards. They are listed in the policy, which is publicly available. With respect to the management of environmental and social impact, the primary standards that FMO upholds are the IFC PS and the associated World Bank Group Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines. They cover the larger part of the ESG requirements in the OECD Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises, which also reference the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Consideration to interests of key stakeholders (if relevant) We invite stakeholders to give their views on new policies and position statements that guide our investment process and decision-making. Availability to stakeholders (if relevant) Sustainability Policy Universe, as well as a document describing how FMO navigates dilemmas and issues are all published on FMO’s website. Allocate and structure capital FMO’s policy requirements are translated into internal investment criteria that are applied and assessed at the investment level where FMO assesses both the positive and negative impacts to define the boundaries of where we allocate capital. The exclusion lists and ESG risk appetite define the boundaries for negative impacts. Our labels highlight the potential that individual investments must contribute to certain principles and objectives. The RI and Green Labels help classify individual investments as per their ex-ante (prior to commitment) potential to materially contribute to SDG 10 Reducing Inequalities and SDG 13 Climate Action respectively, thereby allocating capital towards FMO’s strategic impact ambitions. 119 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"For each investment, FMO measures volume indicators (assets under management) which include FMO’s RI and Green-labelled total committed portfolio. Labelling processes are operationalized using FMO’s Sustainability Information System (SIS). Reducing Inequalities Label The RI Label steers toward investments that have the ex-ante potential to materially contribute to SDG 10. Two objectives underlie the RI Label: increase investment in least developed countries (reducing inequality between countries) and increase investment in inclusive growth (reducing inequality within countries). Each of these has a set of principles, definitions and criteria. We report on RI-labelled total new investments. More information on the 2024 performance results is provided in the sub-chapter 'Performance against our strategy' in the section 'Sector performance'. Table 7. Minimum disclosure requirements for RI-labelled total new investments Methodology and assumptions New investment is the aggregate commitment made to a customer in a specific reporting period by FMO and PIM Funds, and by private participants and other public participants directly mobilized by FMO. For the calculation of new investment per participant, the aggregate commitment is allocated to the participants based on their credit risk exposure to the customer. The RI Label is an SDG Label indicating an Instrument has the ex-ante potential to materially contribute to the SDG 10 objectives. Two objectives underlie the RI Label: increase investment in LDCs (reducing inequalities between countries) and increase investment in inclusive growth (reducing inequalities within countries, focusing on gender and youth). Each of these objectives has a set of principles, definitions and criteria. The RI percentage is the share of an investment that is approved for the RI Label.

Minimum disclosure requirements for Green-labelled total new investments Methodology and assumptions New investment is the aggregate commitment made to a customer in a specific reporting period by FMO and PIM Funds, and by private participants and other public participants directly mobilized by FMO. For the calculation of new investments per participant, the aggregate commitment is allocated to the participants based on their credit risk exposure to the customer. The Green Label is an SDG Label indicating an investment has the ex-ante potential to materially contribute to the SDG 13 objectives, including climate mitigation, climate adaptation and resilience, water, circular economy and pollution prevention and biodiversity. The Green percentage is the share of an Instrument that is approved for Green Label.

"financial and non-financial advisory services, development contributions, and inherent contributions. In addition, FMO contributes by identifying and mitigating negative impacts, and through the improvement of ESG performance. FMO’s engagement to generate value for customers overall also adds value to the wider market, the respective sectors and the ecosystem, and supports mutually beneficial progress towards our RI and Green Label targets. The following are sub-components of the way we support value creation at the customer level. ESG management at customer level Our investments may, unintentionally, lead to negative impacts on people and the environment. FMO is exposed to financial risks resulting from our investment selection, the effectiveness of customers to manage their impacts and the effectiveness of FMO’s engagement therein. At FMO, ESG management covers the management of both negative impacts as well as potential financial risks. As part of its investment process, FMO screens and categorizes all customers according to their gross ESG risk profile (i.e. risk that is inherent to the activity to be financed irrespective of a customers’ ESG performance). Based on this screening, the following categorization of customer E&S risk profiles is determined: A and B+ (high risk), B (medium risk) and C (low risk) for direct investments; and ID-A (high risk), ID-B+ (high risk), ID-B (medium risk) and ID-C (low risk) for indirect exposure through debt and PE funds. An initial assessment of the corporate governance (CG) risk for a customer is also conducted, resulting in a CG risk classification. Further, customers are evaluated on their potential negative impacts as well as their ESG performance, i.e. their capacity to manage these. Note that in the case of direct investments, E&S impact is assessed at customer-level. For indirect exposure to FIs, E&S impact is assessed by considering the operations as well as the investments of the FI (i.e. on a portfolio level basis). In particular, the FI customers’ level of exposure to high E&S impact sectors is considered. Similarly, in the case of funds, the E&S risk categories of the underlying investments the fund is composed of are taken into consideration when determining the funds' E&S risk profiles. For high E&S risk customers, we conduct site visits and stakeholder engagement, with further ESG requirements defined and negotiated as needed. Dedicated ESG specialists within FMO engage actively with all high-risk customers. The level and exact focus of engagement depend on the type and severity of impact and/or the extent to which the identified impact pose a threat to the environment, communities, the customer and/or FMO. FMO assesses the customers’ performance in mitigating and managing ESG impacts against the IFC PS. For each applicable standard, FMO monitors the customer’s performance against the standards. Impacts that are not adequately managed by high-risk customers are considered a performance gap, and recorded as such. The performance is assessed against the standards and is used to set the ESG performance target, described in the section 'ESG management at portfolio level'. FMO accepts a limited gap in successful ESG management to our standards. This gap acknowledges residual risk posed by contextual and implementation challenges in our market. FMO ESG specialists work with customers to develop Environmental and Social Action Plans (ESAPs) and Corporate Governance Action Plans (CGAPs) to enhance customer ESG impact management processes and remediate these gaps. FMO’s Credit department evaluates the ESG impacts and performance of each financial proposal and prepares credit advice to guide the final investment decision. Upon approval, all customer contracts will include ESG requirements, and FMO monitors the implementation of these requirements by our customers (throughout the investment period) through regular contact and site visits, often supported by independent consultants. Customer compliance against the ESAP and CGAP, as well as closing of actions, is monitored as part of the Customer Credit Review (CCR) process. In addition, FMO monitors serious incidents as reported by our customers or underperformance that would warrant corrective actions. We follow up on each incident to ensure a robust root cause analysis is conducted and corrective action implemented. For FMO’s high ESG risk customers, we monitor our exposure through FMO’s proprietary SIS. The net ESG risk exposure is the customers’ gross risk exposure corrected for by the customer’s performance managing down the negative impact. The methodology used to track performance for these high-risk customers is described in table 11 for number of customers with E&S performance gaps in portfolio. 121 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"ESG performance tracking in SIS is integrated within the investment process and forms the basis of FMO’s ESG performance target. ESG performance is monitored and updated throughout the lifetime of the investment as part of the annual review cycle of each customer, enabling FMO to have an up-to-date portfolio-wide view of the ESG negative impacts in its portfolio. Impact management at customer level At FMO, different teams contribute to different core elements relating to the management of positive impacts. This includes defining the strategic impact ambition of an investment aligned with 2030 Strategy ambitions, providing methodological guidance and defining reporting frameworks (how to measure), gathering data from customers and other sources, and recording this data in FMO’s SIS; and aggregating and reporting this data internally and externally. To measure, report and monitor the development impact of transactions, deal teams work with customers to define how the investment supports the core SDGs. They select approximately one to three impact indicators that best capture the intended positive impact of that investment and establish baselines and (where possible) time-specific expected values for these indicators. During the annual review process, customers report on the indicators. FMO engages with other European Development Finance Institutions (EDFI) to harmonize indicators to measure impact and align requirements across DFIs for customers. FMO strives towards alignment vis-à- vis the Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations (HIPSO), the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), and Impact Reporting and Investment Standards Plus. Monitor and manage impact at portfolio level At the portfolio level, FMO manages and steers towards positive and negative impacts. FMO measures volume indicators. Impact management at portfolio level The volume indicators include FMO’s RI and Green-labelled total committed portfolio. FMO has a 2030 target of €10 billion for investments that will contribute towards SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities and SDG 13 Climate Action. The labels are a strategic steering tool to this end. In addition, FMO has identified several metrics to measure FMO’s contributions to the SDGs. While these metrics will be monitored for broader impact management purposes or external reporting requirements, only the metrics with a target are used to steer towards our strategic impact objectives. Table 9. Minimum disclosure requirements for SDG 10 Target Target level to be achieved and unit of measurement, and clarification whether target is absolute or relative (where applicable) By 2030, we aim to have an investment portfolio of at least €10 billion in SDG 10 by financing assets that contribute to our SDG 10 objectives.

"Methodologies and assumptions The target has been established following the intent to double FMO’s impact regarding SDG 10 compared to the baseline year 2021. In the absence of a single impact metric, we focused on doubling the size of the relevant portfolios. Setting the target involved a forecasting exercise of the portfolio and subsequent internal discussions. Key assumptions for this target are that FMO can contribute to reducing inequalities within and between countries by steering investments towards 1) least developed countries or 2) activities that support inclusive growth. Hence, an investment can receive an ex-ante RI Label if the investment takes place in, or funds are expected to flow predominantly to LDCs (aligned with SDG 10.9) and/or if the investment is expected to contribute to inclusive business practices or targets the bottom 40 percent of the population (SDG 10.1). Portfolio trajectories per department were forecast during the 2030 Strategy process and SDG10 targets were confirmed with investment directorates, based on past and expected performance. It should be noted that portfolio growth was forecasted using a stable EUR/ USD FX rate of 1.10 through 2030. An appreciating USD has a positive effect on our portfolio results. Target related to environmental matters is based on conclusive scientific evidence (if applicable) NA Stakeholder involvement with target setting The target has been set as part of the 2030 Strategy process. Key input to setting the target was the Corporate Evaluation of our performance on reducing inequalities in the years 2015-2020. The evaluation was concluded in 2021. The target and strategic focus were discussed both formally and informally with key stakeholders during the strategy process. This included the Dutch government, being the main shareholder, and multi- stakeholder dialogues held in the course of 2021. Changes in target In 2024, the RI Label was updated in line with updated market standards (e.g. 2X and the updated MDB Common Principles) and other market developments. Two new sub- categories were added to the reducing within country inequality label to align with the new 2x standards and to account for access to food as a basic goods and services for low-income populations. Performance There was a 42 percent increase in 2024 compared to 2023, to €6.1 billion. This means that the target of €5 billion that was set for 2024 was reached.

"Target related to environmental matters is based on conclusive scientific evidence (if applicable) The Green Label methodology is based on and largely aligned with the Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) common principles on climate finance tracking. This set of principles is not intended to be scientifically evidenced per se, but evidence (such as certification of agricultural products or buildings) is required to support that these investments meet the principles and definition as set out in FMO’s Green Label methodology. Stakeholder involvement with target setting The target has been set as part of the 2030 Strategy which has been discussed both formally and informally with key stakeholders during drafting, including the Dutch government as key stakeholder and shareholder. Changes in target The Green Label methodology was updated in 2024 in line with MDB Common Principles of Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking of October 2021 and the MDB Common Principles of Climate Adaptation Finance Tracking of 2022 and external market standards. Green Label objectives have also been revised splitting the 'other footprint reduction' objective into the objectives biodiversity, water security, circular economy and pollution prevention. Performance There was a 24 percent increase in 2024 compared to 2023, to €5.9 billion. This means that the target of €5.4 billion that was set for 2024 was reached. For more information on key trends and drivers, refer to the sub-chapter 'Performance against our strategy', 'Sector performance'. ESG management at portfolio level FMO measures ESG gross and net risk in our portfolio to monitor our risk profile and to ensure we remain within risk appetite while measuring ESG performance. FMO has a public ESG target on the ESG performance of its high-ESG risk customers’ portfolio. The target is part of FMO’s Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), which specifies the appetite for accepting residual ESG risk. FMO has a cautious appetite for ESG risk in its investments. Full adherence cannot generally be expected at the start of the relationship. FMO strives for investments to be brought in line with our standards within a credible and reasonable period of time. It is understood and accepted that customers/investees have performance gaps as they need knowledge and resources to implement ESG improvements. E&S performance gaps Table 11. Minimum disclosure requirements for number of customers with E&S performance gaps in portfolio Methodology and assumptions Number of customers for which subpar performance has been identified (denoted by 'n'). E&S performance tracking is conducted for all high E&S risk customers, to determine their adherence to the IFC PS. The performance tracker considers all applicable IFC PS criteria per customer and allows these to be scored to assess the potential negative impacts and performance of the customer to mitigate these. For each high E&S risk customer, the following is determined: 1. The customers’ risk exposure to each criterion (1 – Low | 2 – Medium | 3 – High), and 2. The customers’ performance score against each PS criterion (1 – Exemplary | 2 – Good | 3 – Fair | 4 – Caution | 5 Unacceptable). The combination of these elements leads to a 7-letter scale E&S risk rating (AAA, AA, BBB, BB, CCC, CC, D) for each applicable criterion. Ratings BB/BBB/AA/AAA represent adequate customer E&S risk management per criterion, whilst CCC/CC/D are deemed to be inadequate. The lowest rating that the customer has achieved across all IFC PS criteria is used as the overall customer ESG performance rating. Performance is monitored over the lifetime of the investment. Validation by external body other than the assurance provider (if applicable) NA Unit Number 2024 54 The following table provides an overview of the current E&S performance gaps we have identified and how we engage with these customers. It includes the number of customers for which subpar performance has been identified (denoted by 'n'). The outcomes shown below were compiled as part of FMO’s ESG performance tracking on a customer level (the methodology underlying this is outlined in 124 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"table 11). These performance gaps have been summarized by theme in the table that follows which illustrates the high priority issues that still require attention. Table 12. E&S performance gaps E&S performance gaps 2024 Description Our engagement ESRS topic Willingness and commitment (PS1) (n=7) Resistance to engage on E&S issues can stem from over- reliance on DFIs to drive ESG work streams. Commitment can waver due to financial, operational and contextual difficulties. Wavering commitment can have tangible implications on human rights and the environment, for example through delays in implementing management plans or community benefits, or in conducting specialized studies. We use contractual leverage on specific E&S items, raise issues with customers’ top management and exert influence on their boards, e.g. to push for the improvement of organizational culture. - Environmental and social governance and budget (PS1) (n=9) The customer’s leadership is not fully aware of and involved with E&S performance management, and/or has not allocated sufficient budget, resources, or time. Governance issues can result in poor protection of workers’ rights, a range of risks to communities, as well as damage to the environment. We use contractual leverage and escalate the issue to top management. We may offer capacity building and advice on integrating E&S costs into financial planning and monitor frequently. - Identification and assessment of risks and impacts (PS1) (n=8) Weak (initial and ongoing) identification and mitigation of risks. This can adversely impact human rights. We provide customers with continuous engagement with our ESG staff and capacity building. If needed, we exert formal pressure e.g. through withholding additional financing or triggering default. - Environmental and social management system (PS1) (n=13) Since the assessment and management of E&S risks and impacts is part of a larger set of processes that the customer uses to manage its projects, the customer needs to deploy an environmental and social management system (ESMS) to warehouse and utilize such processes. A weak system hampers the ability to identify issues or risks, and through that to improve E&S performance, and so can lead to adverse economic, financial, social, and environmental impacts. We support customers in the development and improvement of an ESMS. - Organizational capacity and competency (PS1) (n=10) E&S teams can be too small, change often, continue to perform poorly, or lack qualified staff. This is an issue in countries where environmental legislation is developing, and/or state human rights policy and practice are weak. We use contractual leverage, offer capacity building and look for competent staff in our network. - Stakeholder engagement, external communication, grievance mechanisms (PS1) (n=16) Trust and communication between FMO’s customer and its stakeholders are eroding or have broken down. Ineffective channels of communication play an important part here, particularly when grievances are insufficiently captured or redressed. Poor performance in this area can infringe on the freedom of opinion and expression, and even result in inhuman treatment, retaliation, and risk to lives. We intensify our customer engagement, offer to connect customers to experts, mediate or provide capacity building. S3 Affected communities Voluntary land rights transfer (PS1) (n=2) Customer needs to demonstrate that the buyer and the seller were both willing to transfer the land. Involuntary land transfer can be masked as voluntary, which can weaken community cohesion, cause tension between company and community and affect people’s livelihoods. We engage with our customers to help them establish a land acquisition process that shows both the buyer and seller are willingly transferring the land. S3 Affected communities Working conditions and management of workers relationship (incl. third party workers) (PS2) (n=14) Project workers working in substandard conditions, unaware of their rights or without access to grievance mechanisms. This can infringe on labor rights. We discuss gaps with the customer, enable capacity building and set conditions, e.g. by making disbursements conditional on improvement. S2 Workers in the value chain Occupational health and safety (PS2) (n=10) Gaps in ensuring safe and healthy working conditions, possibly leading to serious injuries and fatalities. This could infringe upon the right to health and safety in the workplace, and the right to life. We discuss gaps with the customer, enable capacity building and set conditions, e.g. by making disbursements conditional on improvement. S2 Workers in the value chain 125 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Supply chain working conditions (PS2) (n=3) When the customer does not monitor its primary supply chain, risks or incidents affecting vulnerable groups are not adequately addressed. We require customers with supply chains susceptible to high human rights or environmental risks to conduct a supply chain risk assessment. In some cases, they also need to develop a leverage plan and/or action plan to mitigate those risks. S2 Workers in the value chain Resource efficiency and pollution prevention (PS3) (n=10) Projects reduce the availability of water in arid regions or pollution prevention measures are inefficient. This can infringe upon the right to life, the rights of the child and the right to live in a safe, clean, and healthy environment. We discuss gaps with the customer, enable capacity building and set conditions, e.g. by making disbursements conditional on improvement. - Community health, safety and security (PS4) (n=9) Potential negative impacts to local communities are poorly managed, especially when security forces are mandated to protect personnel and assets. The increasing fragility of political environments across the geographies we work in makes this a complex area. We discuss gaps with the customer, enable capacity building and set conditions, e.g. by making disbursements conditional on improvement. FMO can require a root cause analysis and corrective measures or redress. S3 Affected communities Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement (PS5) (n=9) When resettlement and livelihood restoration plans are poorly managed or insufficiently recognize vulnerable groups and/or have ineffective grievance mechanisms. This can impoverish people and infringe on their right to an adequate standard of living, notably the right to food and adequate housing. We find an expert to conduct gap analyses and implement recommendations. In the event of an early exit, FMO seeks to provide remedy to those impacted. S3 Affected communities Biodiversity and living natural resources (PS6) (n=9) Biodiversity potential negative impacts have not been modeled well enough or monitoring and mitigation are insufficient, or new findings are missed or ignored. This reduces biodiversity and access to forest products, thereby infringing on the right to food and/or an adequate standard of living. We intensify customer monitoring, engage a biodiversity expert and use our leverage to improve the situation. E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems Indigenous Peoples (PS7) (n=3) Community engagement processes do not meet FPIC requirement and/or do not allow for sufficient participation of Indigenous Peoples. In some cases, we recognize challenging operating conditions where risks to these communities are difficult to control. This may lead to the infringement of their right to food, traditions and sacred sites. FMO encourages customers to meet FPIC standards, share benefits with communities, and include indigenous groups in livelihood restoration. We may intensify monitoring of contextual risk factors. S3 Affected communities Cultural heritage (PS8) (n=3) Failure to protect cultural heritage. This can infringe on the rights of people to benefit from their and other people’s cultural heritage. We use our leverage to improve the situation, looking at past and future risks. S3 Affected communities Financial intermediaries: financial institutions and fund managers (n=22) Substandard system for identifying and managing E&S potential negative impacts of financed activities. Processes and procedures are unclear, E&S management responsibilities are insufficiently defined and/or capabilities are lacking, or inadequate E&S due diligence and monitoring is performed. This can be compounded by lack of exposure to and experience in E&S risks management by the financial sector and the lack of a level-playing field. This can lead to infringements of all types of human rights as referenced before. We provide expertise and funding for the ESMS or sit on E&S risk management committees. We negotiate improvement plans and, in some cases, initiate or contribute to sector initiatives. - ESG performance target While we monitor all negative impacts in our portfolio, FMO's ESG performance target is set annually for high-ESG risk customers contracted prior to 2024 (identified as the ‘target list’). The target list includes high E&S risk customers and customers with a corporate governance officer in the deal. We register and monitor all potential negative impacts of our high-risk customers and aim to have at least 90 percent of ESG risks in our target list managed at an adequate level by our customers. The 2024 results indicate that, on average, 94 percent of ESG risks were adequately managed. In instances where customer performance deteriorates or open action items are not implemented on time, customers receive lower ratings, which bring down the average of the entire portfolio. The target has 126 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Table 15. Minimum Disclosure Requirements for Climate Risk Policy Scope of policy The policy applies to the FMO-A portfolio (both on and off-balance sheet) and to FMO-managed government funds. It has a specific focus on assessing and managing climate risks related to FMO's loan and equity investments. In 2025, the scope and name of the policy will be expanded from a climate risk policy to a climate- related and environmental financial risk policy. Accountable body The document is approved by the FRC after consultation via the ISCO and owned by Risk. Implementation is currently managed via an internal project and related implementation oversight is performed by the Steering Committee of the project. Third-party standards/ initiatives (if relevant) The document was developed in the light of the ECB Guide on climate-related and environmental risks. Consideration to interests of key stakeholders (if relevant) No key external stakeholders were consulted upfront in this process, but the policy has been shared with DNB for information afterwards. Availability to stakeholders (if relevant) This is an internal policy and the document is therefore not publicly available. With regards to climate change mitigation, FMO manages material IROs through several processes. Most importantly, through our Green Label guidelines, with which we aim for our portfolio to materially contribute to climate mitigation, reduction of GHG emissions and/or increasing sequestration of GHG emissions from the atmosphere (along with adaptation and energy efficiency, as described below). FMO’s Green Label definition is based on the Common Principles for Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking, as defined by the Multilateral Development Banks. All Green-labelled investments should meet FMO’s Green Principles, namely that Green-labelled investments contribute to a genuine improvement and should not contribute to a long-term lock-in of high carbon infrastructure. A genuine improvement implies that 1) the improvement goes beyond the local regulatory requirements 2) the improvement is unrelated to local resources stress and 3) the improvement is sustainable throughout the value chain of an industry or a business. The implementation of our Paris Alignment methodology will contribute to further aligning our new investments to the Paris Agreement. Furthermore, as per our combined Position Statement on Coal and Phasing Out Fossil Fuels, FMO will not invest in any upstream coal mining activities, transportation of coal, construction or renovation of a coal producing plant, or other associated business or infrastructure. Other fossil fuels are only invested in the exceptional case that a transition phase is deemed necessary to improve a country’s energy accessibility. The combined position statement applies to both direct and indirect investments of FMO. The SBF sets out a list of climate change mitigation activities eligible for the sustainability bonds issued. The Climate Risk Policy includes components such as knowledge and awareness development, embedding climate risk in the organization's strategy, governance, risk appetite determination, policy adjustments, stress testing, climate risk assessment methodology development, and internal and external reporting. FMO manages its knowledge components and supports customers primarily via technical assistance. Investment teams are responsible for assessing climate risks and it is at their discretion to discuss the outcomes with clients. The Risk department maintains the methodology and supports knowledge development across the organization. Besides climate mitigation, FMO also aims to contribute to climate adaptation. Most notably, we do this through our Green Label, through which we label those investments that ex ante are expected to positively contribute to climate adaptation. For a customer or an activity to be eligible for a Green Label in this category, it needs to be assessed to meet the climate adaptation principles set by the IFC-MDB joint methodology for climate change adaptation. This means that climate change adaptation is defined as achieving climate resilience outcomes in response to relevant climate change impacts, by managing or reducing physical climate risks, reducing the underlying causes of vulnerability and avoiding maladaptation. 142 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Our Paris Alignment methodology further aims to ensure a minimum level of resilience for Paris alignment. Our physical Climate Risk Assessment underpins our climate adaptation label analysis. The SBF sets out a list of climate change adaptation activities eligible for the sustainability bonds. Following the EDFI Statement on Climate and Energy Finance and as part of our Climate Action Plan, FMO aims to finance initiatives that contribute to adaptation and resilience to climate change, especially in respect of vulnerable communities and natural ecosystems. Improving energy efficiency is one of the ways by which FMO strives to remain climate neutral in all its operational activities. FMO looks to build-up a portfolio that is targeted at improving access to basic services, such as energy, and aiming to optimally use scarce resources. Energy efficiency is seen as a form of climate change mitigation when assessing activities according to the Green Label Guidelines: at least 20 percent reduction in energy consumption or GHG emissions is required for it to comply with that category. Through our E&S practices, we apply IFC PS3: Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention, which is specific for water and pollution (e.g. air, noise, water) related impacts and for opportunities on efficiencies (e.g. energy or water). This also involves the issuance of sustainability bonds used to finance renewable energy and improve energy. Regarding renewable energy deployment, following the EDFI Statement on Climate and Energy Finance, our Sustainability Policy states that FMO is committed to increase its share of investment that contributes to low-carbon, reliable and affordable energy. As described previously, through our Green Label and Position Statements, we aim to increase our portfolio’s share of contribution to renewable energy deployment and avoid investments in non-renewables respectively. Also, investing in renewable energy is central to our Energy sector strategy, which is one of the three core sectors in which FMO invests. Finally, FMO aims to increase the volume of investments in biodiversity and forestry, to remove carbon and increase resilience. For further information please refer to 'E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems'. E1-3 Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies The three main actions to operationalize FMO’s 2030 Strategy in relation to climate are as follows: 1. Aligning our portfolio and investments with the Paris Agreement goals. 2. Increasing climate investments and support to our customers. 3. Active management of our climate action. Details regarding these actions are described in the following sections. Aligning our portfolio and investments with the Paris Agreement goals This action consists of the following sub-actions: 1. Reduce emissions in our investments, so that in 2050 our portfolio’s aggregate absolute emissions, when added with our carbon removal investments’ negative emissions, result in net zero emissions. We will strive to align the overall portfolio emission reductions with aggregate country- and sector- specific 1.5oC emission reduction pathways, taking into account a just and inclusive transition. At FMO we recognize that a starting point for Paris alignment are the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans, and while we will seek to align our investments with these plans, we also seek to raise the ambition level of our customers and strive toward 1.5oC pathway alignment. 143 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"2. Reduce power generation portfolio emissions by 50 percent to 2030, while at the same time approximately doubling our sustainable power generation portfolio and overall energy portfolio. We will consider additional targets in other parts of the portfolio. 3. Assess new investments for Paris alignment from a climate mitigation and resilience perspective, by implementing an investment-level Paris alignment assessment for new transactions. 4. Implement our commitment under the EDFI Climate and Energy Statement regarding fossil fuels in our indirect investments, and consider other policies that support our goals. FMO has a dedicated project allocated to the implementation of this action. Since 2023, FMO has a dedicated workstream focused on developing a Paris alignment methodology and further developing our in-house capacity. In 2024 FMO finalized its Paris alignment methodology, based on the MDB Principles for Paris Alignment. This methodology will be used to assess new investments for Paris alignment from a mitigation and resilience perspective and was piloted in 2024 based on which the methodology was further refined and finalized. The Paris alignment assessment methodology will be rolled out in the coming period and once ready, will be used to assess new transactions. Additionally, FMO will work further towards an approach for striving towards 1.5-degree alignment and develop climate mitigation KPIs for progress measurement. The overall action can be classified as a decarbonization lever, since the sub-actions will reduce emissions in FMO's investment portfolio, thereby mitigating climate change. The target of reducing power generation emissions by 50 percent in 2030 is part of this action. This target – together with performance on expected and achieved GHG reductions - is elaborated in section 'E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation'. Increasing climate investments and support to our customers This action is made of by the following sub-actions: 1. Building up a portfolio of at least €10 billion dedicated to SDG 13 goals in climate mitigation, adaptation & resilience (including nature-based solutions), biodiversity, and other footprint reduction. We do this by engaging with customers such as our financial institutions to encourage their further investments in these objectives, through activities that contribute to developing our markets (market creation), and by mobilizing additional capital to closing the financing gap needed in emerging markets. 2. Increasing our climate mitigating investments and investments that contribute to solutions for adaptation, resilience and biodiversity, thereby strengthening our customers’ resilience to climate change. Examples of what this entails, include: Corporate governance advisory work focused on climate governance and climate risk, building on the work we have done in this area to date. Technical assistance funding, building on platforms like our Green Finance Framework. Engagement with portfolio companies and new customers to influence them to set targets and transition plans to reduce their emissions over time, or at a minimum to consider technical solutions together. Supporting green finance innovation in our investments. Active shareholdership by ensuring our investees are prepared for both climate risks and opportunities. Creating coalitions with key nature conservation organizations, contributing to the understanding of the landscape approach, and promoting community and stakeholder engagement. 3. Provide sector-specific solutions for energy, financial institutions, and agriculture and forestry. Regarding energy, FMO will continue financing utility scale clean energy generation projects (solar, wind both on- and offshore, hydro power and geothermal), with an increased attention towards the least developed countries (LDCs) and fragile states. These efforts will be an important driver behind our climate mitigation and resilience goals. Towards 2030, through sector initiatives, partner engagement, and other means, we will work to remove bottlenecks currently slowing down the sustainable energy transition in some of our markets. We will also work toward sustainable energy access and inclusion, while further scaling both already established / proven and innovative technologies and solutions. 144 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"For financial institutions, FMO will increasingly aim to have a ‘transformative’ impact on customers through a strategic approach including the development of product propositions, capabilities, and related financing with the goal of having the same effect on end beneficiaries. Finally, regarding agriculture and forestry, our focus will remain on strengthening local agricultural and food supply chains for both local or regional markets to increase local production and reduce reliance on imports, to improve local access to nutritious food, and to reduce food waste (e.g. through more and improved storage and distribution). We continue our focus on decent work and economic inclusion of the bottom 40 percent of income distribution, including smallholder farmers and women. Towards 2030, emphasis will be on engagement and investing more in global merchants, input providers and food companies with leverage to increase sustainable practices, along the (international) agricultural supply chains. We will continue expanding our integral/ landscape approach to supporting and investing in sustainable land-use and ecosystem protection and restoration, among others, through our work on forestry (carbon sequestration), climate smart and regenerative agriculture, soil improvements and livelihoods. 4. Continue to invest in carbon removals, specifically forestry, and help build these markets. More details on this are provided in the section 'E1-7 GHG Removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits'. 5. Contribute to our impact portfolio growth objectives through our market creation efforts and scale our activities through our mobilization efforts. In order to advance our impact contributions (including for climate action), through ‘market creation’ we aim to develop unbankable opportunities into bankable projects, as well as drive topics and business models of the future. We aim to accelerate impact by upscaling mobilization of private and public capital by aiming to double this portfolio by 2030 through: Developing climate fund propositions for large scale mobilization, following a just and inclusive transition approach, targeting both climate impact and social impact. Blending public and commercial funding for high-impact propositions in LDCs. Exploring possibilities for equity mobilization. Strengthening syndication efforts by increasing sourcing capacity of transactions, and by expanding and diversifying our investor base. 6. Engaging with our customers to increase their Paris alignment and provide them with technical assistance and other support. This will include helping to develop climate governance and climate risk frameworks and tools to work with their clients. We will specifically start with pan-regional customers as agents of change, gradually expanding to all customers over time. FMO’s Green Label Methodology was updated in 2023 by the Sustainability Strategy and Policy team (established in 2023), following updated Multilateral Development Banks common principles for climate mitigation finance tracking. FMO has also established a Sustainable Finance Advisory team to support investment teams with Green deal origination. This team reached its full size at the end of 2023 and initiated work with the sectors in 2024. On advancing sector-specific solutions for energy, financial institutions, and agriculture and forestry, in 2024, FMO developed a climate framework for Technical Assistance (TA) to the Private Equity and Agribusiness, Food and Water sectors. Through the climate framework, FMO is able to offer customers in the Private Equity and Agribusiness, Food and Water sectors TA on climate adaptation and mitigation. This includes climate awareness training, climate risk assessments, GHG measurement and reporting, climate action planning and implementation, climate opportunity origination, and compliance with sustainability standards. As part of our ambition to continue to invest in carbon removals, specifically forestry, and help build these markets, FMO has investment officers specialized in forestry in various investment teams. Under market creation, FMO has defined four focus themes: financial inclusion and resilience for entrepreneurs, responsible energy transition, forestry and sustainable land-use, and food system transformation. In 2024, we worked in particular on operationalizing and building out the financial inclusion theme. 145 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"The overall action can be classified as a decarbonization lever, since it will contribute to reducing emissions, thereby mitigating climate change. However, no GHG emission reduction target is linked to this action. Active management of our climate action This action is comprised of a set of sub-actions: 1. Monitor our work at a portfolio level, including absolute and relative emission levels. In order to achieve the impact we aim for, having the right data and additional information needed for measuring and steering our work will be key. 2. Continue to improve data quality and collection, including at the level of our customers. Data collection in our markets and for our specific customer types is not always readily available, especially for investments in smaller companies and for financial institutions and funds, which need to obtain data from their clients. To tackle this challenge, together with our development finance institution partners, we launched the Joint Impact Model (JIM) in 2021. The JIM allows us to model the emissions in the absence of emission data, to have an indication of our portfolio emissions. 3. Adopt an adaptive management approach and adjust our actions based on data and information. The intent of our data/information collection drive is to not only use the information we gather to report and for compliance purposes, but to also better actively manage our portfolio and tailor our climate actions to what is most effective. Moving forward, we will continue to work on improving our systems. 4. Implement a climate risk framework to manage the portfolio for both physical and transition climate risk. Integrating climate risk at FMO is about ensuring that risks to our portfolio due to climate change (physical and transition risks) are structurally identified, assessed, and managed. It is also about bringing this knowledge to our customers and structuring our transactions with the same considerations. Ultimately managing climate risk is another way to drive the change we want to see in our markets. The implementation of this action is mainly covered via a project. In 2024, FMO made progress in developing transition and physical risk assessment methodologies for assessing climate risk. Physical risk assessment tooling is currently implemented for all sectors. Furthermore, FMO established a climate risk policy as well as a quarterly portfolio scan as part of the climate risk framework. FMO also continued work on improving data quality and collection. For the first time, FMO reported the PCAF score for the tracking of emissions data quality. FMO will further work on transition risk assessment and improving data quality and management. FMO will also aim to refine emissions data to better take into account known use-of-proceeds instruments, i.e., when the investment is allocated to specific assets of a customer. While this action aims to enhance FMO’s management of climate actions, such as creating more awareness via enhanced data and methodologies, the overall action cannot be classified as a decarbonization lever since it does not directly contribute to GHG reduction.

"being formalized. To ensure the narrative's accuracy and completeness, the report undergoes multiple levels of review within FMO. At FMO, risks are prioritized based on their severity, which is assessed using two factors: probability and impact. Probability measures how likely a risk event is to occur. Impact considers the potential consequences, which can include operational loss, financial errors, failure to meet business goals, regulatory issues, or damage to reputation. Risk severity is assessed based on probability and impact, and classified as high, medium, or low. This corresponds to a 'Level of Concern' (LoC) rating: high (LoC 3), medium (LoC 2), or low (LoC 1). Depending on the severity, actions are required: High (LoC 3): actions must be completed within 3-6 months. Medium (LoC 2): actions should be completed within 6-9 months. Low (LoC 1): actions are optional. As the four risks identified as part of the first layer are key risks, they have a high LoC, while the risks in the second layer have been qualified with a medium LoC. The risks within the first layer have controls in place that are regularly being monitored and tested by their designated owners, in line with FMO’s approach. While for the second layer of risks related to data, controls are in place, but only some of them are being actively monitored as part of FMO’s overall risk governance and risk management approach. FMO is currently working on integrating the controls not regularly monitored and tested within the organization’s overall risk and management approach. Future actions FMO adheres to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Code is maintained by the Monitoring Committee Dutch Corporate Governance Code and supported by the ‘schragende partijen’ (supporting parties) consisting of Eumedion, Euronext, FNV, CNV, Vereniging van Effecten Bezitters (VEB), de Vereniging van Effecten Uitgevende Ondernemingen (VEUO) and VNO-NCW. The supporting parties and the Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants have suggested amending the Code to include a ‘Verklaring omtrent Risicobeheersing’ (VOR). According to this proposal, listed companies and other companies following the Dutch Corporate Governance Code will be required to include for the first time in the annual report on 2025 a disclosure statement on risk management and internal controls over sustainability reporting. Although sustainability reporting guidelines such as CSRD / ESRS are not embedded in the Corporate Governance code yet, FMO would like to adhere to these requirements as soon as possible. ESRS calls for a connectivity between the 'Financial Statements' and 'Sustainability statement' both from the process perspective and disclosures perspective. As this is the first time reporting, FMO recognizes this as a point of attention. It is up to the Monitoring Committee Dutch Corporate Governance Code to amend the Code to accommodate the VOR proposal. In a letter to the Dutch parliament, the minister of finance encourages the (to be appointed) Monitoring Committee to include the VOR. 131 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"E1 Climate Change E1 Introduction In its 2030 Strategy and Climate Action Plan, FMO presents a set of ambitions, targets and actions to contribute to climate change mitigation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. SDG 13 on Climate Change is one of the core components of our 2030 Strategy. An important component of FMO's climate ambition is that it contributes to a just and inclusive transition. We recognize that environmental and social objectives are inextricably linked. For FMO, this represents both the synergies and necessity of pursuing our core SDG goals SDGs 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 10 (Reducing Inequalities), and 13 (Climate Action) together, if we are to be successful in contributing to any of them individually. FMO acknowledges that climate change will undermine sustainable development goals if not urgently addressed. This implies that FMO’s customers (both current and new) might face new and never previously experienced risks from negative climate change consequences. The rise in weather and climate extremes has already led to some irreversible effects, while the preservation of ecosystems is essential for human well-being and the achievement of the SDGs. FMO recognizes that development finance is urgently needed to contribute to SDG 13, and to support an inclusive and just transition. FMO steers its investments towards those aiming at contributing to a positive impact towards SDG 13, such as investments related to climate adaptation, resilience and mitigation, while managing possible negative impacts. E1 Impacts, risks and opportunities Based on our double materiality assessment (DMA), we have identified the following impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) related to the topic of climate change.

Risk of a chaotic transition to low-carbon economy. Downstream investment portfolio Climate Risk Policy CAP: Active management of our climate action. No specific target FMO’s DMA, as described in 'ESRS 2 - Double materiality assessment', identified potential negative impacts through financed absolute emissions and potential positive impacts through investments in climate adaptation, climate mitigation and renewable energy as well as physical and transition risks. The Climate Risk Report and Climate Action Plan (CAP), both prepared in 2022, provided important input for determining FMO’s climate-related IROs. Impacts Both positive and negative impacts take place downstream in our investment portfolio. The impact of our own operations or those of our upstream suppliers are not considered material because of the small scale of emissions compared to those in our portfolio. The CAP describes how FMO actively monitors its activities and portfolio, thereby identifying actual and potential future GHG emission sources and other climate-related impacts within its operations and across its value chains. The intent of our data/ information collection drive is not only to use the information we gather for reporting and compliance purposes, but to actively manage our portfolio better, and to tailor our climate actions towards what is most effective. We will continue to work on improving our internal management and reporting systems to actively manage progress towards our sustainability goals. As part of our ESG management process we uphold IFC Performance Standard 3 (IFC PS3) (addressing resource efficiency and pollution prevention), which includes minimizing the pollution from project activities. When project related emissions are potentially significant, FMO requires its customers to adopt measures (e.g. use of renewable energy sources, sustainable agricultural, the reduction of fugitive emissions, etc.) that avoid or reduce emissions in order to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment (IFC PS3). FMO requires that projects implement technically and financially feasible and cost-effective measures for integrating emission reduction into product design and operational processes (IFC PS3). Specifically, ""this applies to the release of pollutants to air, water, and land due to routine, non- routine, and accidental circumstances with the potential for local, regional, and transboundary impacts."" Transboundary pollutants include those covered under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary 134 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Air Pollution, such VOCs that are key precursors in the formation of tropospheric ozone and particulate matter (of which black carbon is a significant component). This means that by upholding the IFC PS we indirectly screen investments for climate-related impacts, such as black carbon and tropospheric ozone. FMO reports on financed absolute emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3 in line with the GHG Protocol, as described in more detail in section 'E1-6 Gross Scope 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions'. The financed absolute GHG emissions are reported in line with the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry published by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). Although emissions from FMO operations are not considered material, we will continue to report scope 1 and 2 emissions to be able to present a full picture of our GHG emission footprint. Risks & opportunities The material climate-related risks and opportunities for FMO occur both upstream and downstream in the investment portfolio. The climate-related risks identified in the DMA are aligned with internal risk assessment processes and documents. The assessment of climate risks happens on an ongoing basis at FMO. We run a portfolio scan on a quarterly basis that is reported to the Financial Risk Committee (FRC), which monitors our portfolio’s exposure to physical and transition risks. We also conduct materiality assessments which determine the potential for climate risk drivers to affect FMO’s portfolio or the entity itself. Both processes are discussed with the FRC. Furthermore, work is ongoing to embed climate risk assessments at the organizational level as well as within the investment cycle. The regular climate risk assessments inform the Financial Risk team’s decisions. Scenarios are considered and factors are stressed in FMO’s Internal Capital and Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Processes (ICAAP and ILAAP), which are aligned with our regular Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) cycle. FMO’s physical climate risks were assessed over the current, medium and long-term using a high- emissions scenario and in line with guidelines from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ECB guide on Climate-related and Environmental Risks. While the climate risk assessment covers physical risks and transition risks, the various time horizons and high-emissions scenario were applied only to physical risks. FMO is currently working on further defining a methodology to assess transition risks that is suitable for the markets in which it operates. The climate risks associated with FMO’s investment portfolio are also described in FMO’s first climate risk report, which, as mentioned above, are aligned with the climate-related risks identified in the DMA. This report was written in line with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) requirements and shows that FMO’s portfolio is exposed to climate change risks, which will increase over time, with clear differences across locations, sectors and hazard types. This analysis, as well as those resulting from FMO’s ICAAP and ILAAP and continuous monitoring, served as input for the DMA, where additional transition risks (and opportunities) were identified. The climate scenarios used are currently independent of the financial models, as FMO currently does not include climate-related assumptions in the financial models. FMO will explore assessing possible inclusion of climate-related risks in our financial models based on expected credit losses. As part of our DMA, we identified a specific downstream (portfolio) risk related to water (E3) that we feel is better addressed under the risk of climate hazards here in E1: “There is a global risk of increased water scarcity due to climate change, increased water withdrawals and unsustainable water practices. This affects costs of production through higher water prices and leads to reduced crop yield and failure.” This is covered by the current climate hazards risk described in Table 14. Physical risks FMO plans to perform a physical risk assessment in line with the recommendations set out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the ECB guide on Climate-related and Environmental Risks (ECB, 2021). For this reason we have developed a C&E risk assessment tool that supports the identification and monitoring of C&E risks at the customer level. The tool currently focuses mainly on physical climate risks. 135 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Various physical risks (flooding, temperature extremes, fire, water stress, drought, erosion, tropical cyclones and crop yield loss) are assessed based on a multiplication of hazard scores at specific locations or regions and sensitivity scores (specific to the sector/industry of the investment/business activity) to these hazards. The climate-related physical hazards have been identified over current-, medium- and long-term time horizons. For the physical climate risks, current-, medium- and long-term time horizons have been defined as follows: Current-term: 2011-2040 Medium-term: 2041-2070 Long-term: 2071-2100 These time horizons are different from the time horizons specified by the ESRS. The time horizons used are in line with standard practice in the climate science community, where climate refers to the long- term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years. In some cases, if the original data source did not overlap with these time horizons, the closest time period was chosen. The physical risk assessments are currently not tied to the lifetime of the exposure. Even if human-induced climate changes would not materialize in the near future under the climatological time horizon, foreseen changes may already affect investment decisions and other financial parameters today and therefore materialize earlier from a financial risk perspective, within the time horizons as specified by the ESRS. The ICAAP assessments consider climate risks over a period of three years. Physical risks hazards are estimated to affect FMO’s customers in various locations and sectors to different extents, according to the climate risk assessment. The physical risks assessed in the climate risk assessments were summarized as one physical risk in the DMA. The various physical risks for FMO’s relevant industries are assessed on an ongoing basis and reported through regular reviews within internal committees at portfolio level. To increase the granularity and understanding of these risks, FMO is currently in the process of rolling out physical climate risk assessments in the investment process, complementing the assessment at portfolio level as mentioned above. The scores for physical hazards were created for both acute and chronic hazard types under a high emissions or worst-case climate scenario, which is the IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario. RCP 4.5 was also considered, but the projections from RCP 8.5 cover a greater range of climate conditions, especially for the long-term time horizon. Furthermore, the temperature and rainfall changes are more intense under RCP 8.5, and the long-term projections from RCP 4.5 are quite similar to the medium-term projection from RCP 8.5. In conclusion, RCP 8.5 covers a wider range of climate conditions (more extremes) for the risk assessment, so we believe this is the more appropriate choice, as it better covers potential risks and uncertainties. RCP 8.5 makes the following assumptions about policies, macro-economic trends, energy usage and mix, and technology: Policy Assumptions: It assumes minimal or no additional climate policies beyond those already in place, leading to high GHG emissions. Macroeconomic Trends: The scenario includes assumptions about high population growth and relatively slow income growth. Energy Usage and Mix: It projects high energy demand with a continued reliance on fossil fuels, resulting in significant GHG emissions. Technology Assumptions: The scenario assumes modest rates of technological change and improvements in energy intensity, meaning that advancements in energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies are not sufficient to offset the high energy demand. The scores for physical hazards were derived from climate models listed in the IPCC CMIP5 and CMIP6 protocols, where available. Each hazard was evaluated using a specifically chosen modeling method and simulated hazard exposure outputs from leading, peer-reviewed research institutions, and was further developed in partnership with well-known research institutions. The risk scores were created and standardized at an approximate 50x50 km spatial resolution as a level 1 detailed product. If grid location or country data was missing for an investment or loan, it was excluded from the analysis.

"E3 Water and Marine Resources E3 Introduction FMO recognizes the critical role of water management in supporting climate and nature goals, ecosystems, and economic development. FMO invests in projects dependent on freshwater resources in the water, energy and agrifood portfolios, and impacts are expected regarding both water quality and water availability. As part of the impact management strategy, FMO has an ambition to invest in water efficient projects that align with the wider goals of environmental protection, safeguard affected communities, and ensure the sustainable use of water resources. By addressing water impacts, FMO aims to contribute to sustainable development and help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on water resources. E3 Impacts, risks and opportunities The following table provides an overview of how each impact, risk and opportunity (IRO) relates to the policies, actions and targets respectively. The impacts caused by our own operations fell below the materiality threshold. However, two negative impacts in our investment portfolio are considered to be material. It should be noted that the double materiality assessment (DMA) for E1 on Climate included a Climate Risk Assessment, through which a material financial risk related to water dependency was identified. This risk will be reported under 'E1 Climate change' as it relates to climate change effects that lead to increased water scarcity. Table 23.

The ESG management approach for screening and monitoring customers with regard to potential negative impacts on local communities are described in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'. FMO has adopted 169 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"the IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) as its operating standard. The following documents are relevant for water: a. IFC PS3, 4 and 6 provide specific guidance on water related topics, as they respectively cover Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention, Community Health, Safety, and Security, and Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources. b. Our Position Statement on Hydropower Plants outlines our approach to investing in hydroelectric projects, emphasizing the balance between harnessing their economic and environmental benefits and rigorously assessing and mitigating potential technical, environmental, and social impacts, including adherence to IFC PS and continuous monitoring. FMO’s policies that address water-related impacts are aimed at reducing the material negative impacts downstream in FMO’s value chain. FMO aims to support customers to improve their sustainable use of natural resources, such as water, and to prevent degradation of ecosystems. FMO assesses its direct and indirect potential and existing investments over time according to ESG criteria such as the presence and quality of the E&S management system, availability, quantity and quality of resources such as water for local communities and related impacts on resource efficiency including the consumption and use of water. The scope of this assessment applies to the financed activities and their primary suppliers, though FMO may look beyond the direct financed activities when salient risks are expected in the value chain. Potable water availability or sanitary wastewater collection, treatment, or discharge are also considered, whereby opportunities are explored to improve these aspects, especially where these can be provided at marginal cost to the project. When projects are a potentially significant consumer of water, in addition to applying the resource efficiency requirements of the IFC PS3, FMO requires its customers to adopt measures (e.g., use of additional water conservation measures, the use of alternative water supplies, water consumption offsets, evaluation of alternative project locations) that avoid or reduce water usage so that the project’s water consumption does not have significant negative impacts. FMO requires that projects implement technically and financially feasible and cost-effective measures for improving efficiency in its consumption of water, integrating the principles of cleaner production into product design and production processes with the objective of conserving water. Policies related to water management pertain to an organization's own operations. Since FMO's own operations were not identified as material in the DMA, this type of water management policies is not relevant for FMO. Since the water-related impacts that were identified to be material for FMO are not related to our own operations, there are no policies required to address water stress near one of FMO’s operating sites. E3-2 Key actions As part of the normal due diligence process, we identify performance gaps against our standards, and we agree with our customers on improvements that are required in relation to negative impacts on water and marine resources (e.g. impact of hazardous materials on ecosystem services, degradation of natural resources, water usage etc.). These improvements are translated into an action plan (ESAP) which is incorporated into the contract. The ESAP also stipulates timelines for the customers to close the actions (see 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'). Compliance with the ESAP and closing of actions is monitored as part of the customer credit review process which takes place annually. Where incidents take place, a corrective action plan may be required to mitigate and possibly remediate the impact; this can be agreed with the customer. E3-3 Targets FMO has not adopted targets related to water resources. However, FMO’s 90 percent ESG performance target includes but is not limited to water impact from related investments (incl. IFC PS3, 4 and 6). Detailed information on this target is provided in 'ESRS 2 – IRO management'. 170 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems E4 Introduction FMO recognizes the value of ecosystems that form the natural capital for the world economy. Their degradation poses a direct risk for FMO’s customers and the societies in which they operate. When we talk about biodiversity, we look at it from a broader perspective, taking into consideration nature and natural capital. While biodiversity and nature are not always explicitly singled out as specific objectives in the way FMO manages on sustainability-related matters (see 'ESRS 2 - IRO Management'). FMO’s impact management procedures are aligned with environmental conservation, sustainable use of natural resources, and protection of ecosystems. Furthermore, they promote consideration of how investments affect biodiversity and the pursuit of investments that support nature-based solutions and conservation goals. FMO aims to achieve positive impacts through biodiversity finance that are focused on for instance nature-based solutions and forestry- and regenerative agriculture investments. As per the 2030 Strategy, FMO aims to increase the volume of investments contributing to biodiversity. Together with our partners, FMO committed to engage on climate adaptation and resilience, and biodiversity, by creating coalitions with key nature conservancy organizations, contributing to the understanding of the landscape approach, promoting community and stakeholder engagement.

Opportunity to develop new biodiversity positive markets Downstream (AFW portfolio) Sustainability Policy Increase volume of investments related to biodiversity. No specific target We identified biodiversity and ecosystems to be a material topic because of our potential and actual positive and negative impacts from our investments in the agrifood, water, and energy sectors (downstream value chain), and because of the developments in biodiversity-positive financing markets that can create material opportunities for FMO. However, currently we do not consider biodiversity a material topic from the financial risk perspective. For more details, please refer to our double materiality assessment process (DMA) as described in 'ESRS 2 - Double materiality assessment'. As part of our assessment on the materiality of the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems in our own operations and downstream value chain we conducted desk research into the agrifood, water and energy sectors looking into international sector standards, peers, trends, and media coverage. Additionally, we considered FMO’s 2030 Strategy and current ways of working (such as our ESG management process, climate risk assessment, Green Label assessments, and forestry strategy). As such, we took into consideration impact drivers such as climate change, land-use change, the impact on marine and freshwater-use, direct exploitation and invasive alien species and pollution, as well as impacts on the state of species, impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems and impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services. While our DMA was being conducted, we were also in the process of creating a methodology to assess our dependency on nature. As this methodology was still in early stages of development during the reporting period, we did not take it into consideration during our DMA. For the methodology to assess dependencies on nature we are applying the ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure) materiality ratings to help evaluate our exposure to nature- 172 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"

Throughout the years, at a corporate level we have taken the outcomes of stakeholder engagement into account in, among other things: FMO’s strategy development (2030 Strategy: Pioneer-Develop-Scale) FMO’s double materiality assessment FMO’s Sustainability Policy FMO’s position statements FMO’s Customer Disclosure Policy The Independent Complaints Mechanism FMO’s Climate Action Plan (CAP) During the development of our long-term 2030 Strategy Pioneer – Develop – Scale we consulted internal stakeholders (including FMO’s employees) and external stakeholders. For this consultation, meetings were held with the Dutch Ministry of Finance, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DNB, NGOs, (E)DFIs, private banks, commercial finance partners, and the European Commission (EC). At the start of the strategic development process, FMO collected the key topics and expectations of these stakeholders, which was part of the foundation for the further development of the long-term strategy. The Dutch Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance provided their vision during various stages of the strategy development process. During the materiality assessment, FMO takes the views and interests of stakeholders into account. We do this either by consulting them directly or integrating knowledge about stakeholder interests coming out of regular stakeholder engagement activities as described in this section. When developing or updating policy statements, we invite stakeholders to give their views on new policies and position statements that guide our investment process and decision-making. For example, in 2016, we developed a comprehensive Sustainability Policy, taking into account more than 300 comments from various parties from society, government and customers. We are active participants in a number of multi-stakeholder dialogues. At an investment level, the outcomes of stakeholder engagement are taken into account via our due diligence process. Stakeholder and community engagement is a key principle embedded within the IFC PS. This means that FMO is committed to actively engaging with affected stakeholders and local communities throughout the project lifecycle in order to understand their concerns, incorporate their perspectives into decision-making processes, and mitigate any negative impacts on them. On an ad-hoc basis, FMO also engages with value chain workers as part of its monitoring. For more information refer to section 'ESRS 2 - IRO management' and specific information on this type of stakeholder engagement in the sections 'S2-2 Processes for engaging with value chain workers', 'S3-2 Processes for engaging with affected communities' and 'S4-2 Processes for engaging with consumers and end-users'. The Integrity and Issue Management Committee (IIMC) is a sub-committee of the Non-Financial Risk Committee (NFRC) and is appointed by the Management Board. The IIMC monitors and advises on designated projects, transactions, and customers on a corporate and project level, including where applicable complaints related matters brought forward via the ICM for proposed, active and completed/ exited investments. The Management Board is informed of the views and interests of FMO project affected stakeholders on a case-by-case basis and the Supervisory Board (through the Management Board) via quarterly periodic briefs. For example, when there is a material impact voiced via 1) ex-ante (prior to commitment) disclosure questions; 2) NGO questions; or 3) (ongoing) complaints with the ICM. 117 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"FMO regularly conducts employee surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and engagement levels. For more information on how we engage with our employees please refer to the sub-chapter 'S1 - Own Workforce'. Future steps towards our stakeholder dialogues In 2024, we worked on an outline policy for effective dialogue with the relevant corporate stakeholders, which will be published as a position statement in the first quarter of 2025. This policy will enable FMO to effectively decide: (i) if engagement is needed for specific topics, (ii) which stakeholders should be involved, (iii) what the timelines are for this engagement process and (iv) how the process should be organized. Currently, the ICM Policy is being revised. Input from stakeholders will be sought by a public consultation of the draft policy, to enhance and clarify the policy and increase the trust and buy-in of stakeholders. Advocacy NGOs are especially interested in the ICM because they use it to escalate their complaints. NGOs that have requested to be able to provide input at an early stage – before public consultation – have been engaged with to share their views. ESRS 2 IRO management FMO manages material sustainability-related matters, including material impacts, risks and opportunities, through various policies and actions. Material impacts, risks and opportunities identified for S1 and G1 relate to FMO's own operations and are, therefore, managed by FMO's Human Resources and Compliance departments. Material impacts, risks and opportunities identified for E1, E3, E4, S2, S3 and S4 relate to FMO's customers and investments (downstream value chain) and are managed as part of our investment process. In addition, FMO has developed an impact management framework to ensure it takes an integrated approach to managing positive and negative impacts – potential and actual – as well as the financial risks that may result from the negative impacts in its investment portfolio. Our management approach to our own workforce and business conduct are described in the S1 and G1 topical statements, respectively. Our approach to impact management is common across E1, E3, E4, S2, S3 and S4 and is described in the following section. Negative impacts and the resulting financial risks are managed through ESG management practices. Negative impacts on people and the environment could result in financial risks, leading to, for example, financial (remediation, legal) costs to FMO or its customer, jeopardize access to capital for FMO (from external investors), jeopardizing the license to operate, jeopardizing shareholder relations or reputational damage. This is further described in the paragraphs relating to ESG management. Positive impacts are managed through allocating and structuring capital towards the SDGs, mostly through our Reducing Inequalities (RI) and Green Labels. This is further described in the paragraphs relating to impact management. Figure 2. Impact management framework Strategy and policy FMO’s impact and sustainability commitments are outlined in FMO’s Sustainability Policy, which was first approved by FMO’s Management Board in 2016.

In addition, FMO upholds (inter)national standards, including the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the Client Protection Principles (CPPs). In addition, FMO has adopted the IFC PS (2012) as its operating standard. FMO requires its customers to comply with these standards and in doing so to identify, prevent and mitigate negative social and environmental impacts. FMO’s Sustainability Policy and position statements apply to all our new investments. This includes both direct investments and investments through financial intermediaries. This policy is the foundation of our impact management framework and provides guidance for FMO’s internal processes. FMO considers this policy a living document. It will be updated based on lessons learned and input from FMO’s stakeholders. Our Sustainability Policy and position statements undergo targeted and public consultation with various relevant stakeholder groups (e.g. the Dutch government, DFI partners, (commercial) peers, (inter)national Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and think tanks, and relevant (industry) standard organizations) during the development process and every three years, are formally approved by the Management Board.

The exclusion lists and ESG risk appetite define the boundaries for negative impacts. Our labels highlight the potential that individual investments must contribute to certain principles and objectives. The RI and Green Labels help classify individual investments as per their ex-ante (prior to commitment) potential to materially contribute to SDG 10 Reducing Inequalities and SDG 13 Climate Action respectively, thereby allocating capital towards FMO’s strategic impact ambitions. 119 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"For each investment, FMO measures volume indicators (assets under management) which include FMO’s RI and Green-labelled total committed portfolio. Labelling processes are operationalized using FMO’s Sustainability Information System (SIS). Reducing Inequalities Label The RI Label steers toward investments that have the ex-ante potential to materially contribute to SDG 10.

"financial and non-financial advisory services, development contributions, and inherent contributions. In addition, FMO contributes by identifying and mitigating negative impacts, and through the improvement of ESG performance. FMO’s engagement to generate value for customers overall also adds value to the wider market, the respective sectors and the ecosystem, and supports mutually beneficial progress towards our RI and Green Label targets. The following are sub-components of the way we support value creation at the customer level. ESG management at customer level Our investments may, unintentionally, lead to negative impacts on people and the environment. FMO is exposed to financial risks resulting from our investment selection, the effectiveness of customers to manage their impacts and the effectiveness of FMO’s engagement therein. At FMO, ESG management covers the management of both negative impacts as well as potential financial risks. As part of its investment process, FMO screens and categorizes all customers according to their gross ESG risk profile (i.e. risk that is inherent to the activity to be financed irrespective of a customers’ ESG performance). Based on this screening, the following categorization of customer E&S risk profiles is determined: A and B+ (high risk), B (medium risk) and C (low risk) for direct investments; and ID-A (high risk), ID-B+ (high risk), ID-B (medium risk) and ID-C (low risk) for indirect exposure through debt and PE funds. An initial assessment of the corporate governance (CG) risk for a customer is also conducted, resulting in a CG risk classification. Further, customers are evaluated on their potential negative impacts as well as their ESG performance, i.e. their capacity to manage these. Note that in the case of direct investments, E&S impact is assessed at customer-level. For indirect exposure to FIs, E&S impact is assessed by considering the operations as well as the investments of the FI (i.e. on a portfolio level basis). In particular, the FI customers’ level of exposure to high E&S impact sectors is considered. Similarly, in the case of funds, the E&S risk categories of the underlying investments the fund is composed of are taken into consideration when determining the funds' E&S risk profiles. For high E&S risk customers, we conduct site visits and stakeholder engagement, with further ESG requirements defined and negotiated as needed. Dedicated ESG specialists within FMO engage actively with all high-risk customers. The level and exact focus of engagement depend on the type and severity of impact and/or the extent to which the identified impact pose a threat to the environment, communities, the customer and/or FMO. FMO assesses the customers’ performance in mitigating and managing ESG impacts against the IFC PS. For each applicable standard, FMO monitors the customer’s performance against the standards. Impacts that are not adequately managed by high-risk customers are considered a performance gap, and recorded as such. The performance is assessed against the standards and is used to set the ESG performance target, described in the section 'ESG management at portfolio level'. FMO accepts a limited gap in successful ESG management to our standards. This gap acknowledges residual risk posed by contextual and implementation challenges in our market. FMO ESG specialists work with customers to develop Environmental and Social Action Plans (ESAPs) and Corporate Governance Action Plans (CGAPs) to enhance customer ESG impact management processes and remediate these gaps. FMO’s Credit department evaluates the ESG impacts and performance of each financial proposal and prepares credit advice to guide the final investment decision. Upon approval, all customer contracts will include ESG requirements, and FMO monitors the implementation of these requirements by our customers (throughout the investment period) through regular contact and site visits, often supported by independent consultants. Customer compliance against the ESAP and CGAP, as well as closing of actions, is monitored as part of the Customer Credit Review (CCR) process. In addition, FMO monitors serious incidents as reported by our customers or underperformance that would warrant corrective actions. We follow up on each incident to ensure a robust root cause analysis is conducted and corrective action implemented. For FMO’s high ESG risk customers, we monitor our exposure through FMO’s proprietary SIS. The net ESG risk exposure is the customers’ gross risk exposure corrected for by the customer’s performance managing down the negative impact. The methodology used to track performance for these high-risk customers is described in table 11 for number of customers with E&S performance gaps in portfolio. 121 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"ESG performance tracking in SIS is integrated within the investment process and forms the basis of FMO’s ESG performance target. ESG performance is monitored and updated throughout the lifetime of the investment as part of the annual review cycle of each customer, enabling FMO to have an up-to-date portfolio-wide view of the ESG negative impacts in its portfolio. Impact management at customer level At FMO, different teams contribute to different core elements relating to the management of positive impacts. This includes defining the strategic impact ambition of an investment aligned with 2030 Strategy ambitions, providing methodological guidance and defining reporting frameworks (how to measure), gathering data from customers and other sources, and recording this data in FMO’s SIS; and aggregating and reporting this data internally and externally. To measure, report and monitor the development impact of transactions, deal teams work with customers to define how the investment supports the core SDGs. They select approximately one to three impact indicators that best capture the intended positive impact of that investment and establish baselines and (where possible) time-specific expected values for these indicators. During the annual review process, customers report on the indicators. FMO engages with other European Development Finance Institutions (EDFI) to harmonize indicators to measure impact and align requirements across DFIs for customers. FMO strives towards alignment vis-à- vis the Harmonized Indicators for Private Sector Operations (HIPSO), the Global Impact Investing Network (GIIN), and Impact Reporting and Investment Standards Plus. Monitor and manage impact at portfolio level At the portfolio level, FMO manages and steers towards positive and negative impacts. FMO measures volume indicators. Impact management at portfolio level The volume indicators include FMO’s RI and Green-labelled total committed portfolio. FMO has a 2030 target of €10 billion for investments that will contribute towards SDG 10 Reduced Inequalities and SDG 13 Climate Action. The labels are a strategic steering tool to this end. In addition, FMO has identified several metrics to measure FMO’s contributions to the SDGs. While these metrics will be monitored for broader impact management purposes or external reporting requirements, only the metrics with a target are used to steer towards our strategic impact objectives. Table 9. Minimum disclosure requirements for SDG 10 Target Target level to be achieved and unit of measurement, and clarification whether target is absolute or relative (where applicable) By 2030, we aim to have an investment portfolio of at least €10 billion in SDG 10 by financing assets that contribute to our SDG 10 objectives.

"Methodologies and assumptions The target has been established following the intent to double FMO’s impact regarding SDG 10 compared to the baseline year 2021. In the absence of a single impact metric, we focused on doubling the size of the relevant portfolios. Setting the target involved a forecasting exercise of the portfolio and subsequent internal discussions. Key assumptions for this target are that FMO can contribute to reducing inequalities within and between countries by steering investments towards 1) least developed countries or 2) activities that support inclusive growth. Hence, an investment can receive an ex-ante RI Label if the investment takes place in, or funds are expected to flow predominantly to LDCs (aligned with SDG 10.9) and/or if the investment is expected to contribute to inclusive business practices or targets the bottom 40 percent of the population (SDG 10.1). Portfolio trajectories per department were forecast during the 2030 Strategy process and SDG10 targets were confirmed with investment directorates, based on past and expected performance. It should be noted that portfolio growth was forecasted using a stable EUR/ USD FX rate of 1.10 through 2030. An appreciating USD has a positive effect on our portfolio results. Target related to environmental matters is based on conclusive scientific evidence (if applicable) NA Stakeholder involvement with target setting The target has been set as part of the 2030 Strategy process. Key input to setting the target was the Corporate Evaluation of our performance on reducing inequalities in the years 2015-2020. The evaluation was concluded in 2021. The target and strategic focus were discussed both formally and informally with key stakeholders during the strategy process. This included the Dutch government, being the main shareholder, and multi- stakeholder dialogues held in the course of 2021. Changes in target In 2024, the RI Label was updated in line with updated market standards (e.g. 2X and the updated MDB Common Principles) and other market developments. Two new sub- categories were added to the reducing within country inequality label to align with the new 2x standards and to account for access to food as a basic goods and services for low-income populations. Performance There was a 42 percent increase in 2024 compared to 2023, to €6.1 billion. This means that the target of €5 billion that was set for 2024 was reached.

"Target related to environmental matters is based on conclusive scientific evidence (if applicable) The Green Label methodology is based on and largely aligned with the Multilateral Development Banks (MDB) common principles on climate finance tracking. This set of principles is not intended to be scientifically evidenced per se, but evidence (such as certification of agricultural products or buildings) is required to support that these investments meet the principles and definition as set out in FMO’s Green Label methodology. Stakeholder involvement with target setting The target has been set as part of the 2030 Strategy which has been discussed both formally and informally with key stakeholders during drafting, including the Dutch government as key stakeholder and shareholder. Changes in target The Green Label methodology was updated in 2024 in line with MDB Common Principles of Climate Mitigation Finance Tracking of October 2021 and the MDB Common Principles of Climate Adaptation Finance Tracking of 2022 and external market standards. Green Label objectives have also been revised splitting the 'other footprint reduction' objective into the objectives biodiversity, water security, circular economy and pollution prevention. Performance There was a 24 percent increase in 2024 compared to 2023, to €5.9 billion. This means that the target of €5.4 billion that was set for 2024 was reached. For more information on key trends and drivers, refer to the sub-chapter 'Performance against our strategy', 'Sector performance'. ESG management at portfolio level FMO measures ESG gross and net risk in our portfolio to monitor our risk profile and to ensure we remain within risk appetite while measuring ESG performance. FMO has a public ESG target on the ESG performance of its high-ESG risk customers’ portfolio. The target is part of FMO’s Risk Appetite Framework (RAF), which specifies the appetite for accepting residual ESG risk. FMO has a cautious appetite for ESG risk in its investments. Full adherence cannot generally be expected at the start of the relationship. FMO strives for investments to be brought in line with our standards within a credible and reasonable period of time. It is understood and accepted that customers/investees have performance gaps as they need knowledge and resources to implement ESG improvements. E&S performance gaps Table 11. Minimum disclosure requirements for number of customers with E&S performance gaps in portfolio Methodology and assumptions Number of customers for which subpar performance has been identified (denoted by 'n'). E&S performance tracking is conducted for all high E&S risk customers, to determine their adherence to the IFC PS. The performance tracker considers all applicable IFC PS criteria per customer and allows these to be scored to assess the potential negative impacts and performance of the customer to mitigate these. For each high E&S risk customer, the following is determined: 1. The customers’ risk exposure to each criterion (1 – Low | 2 – Medium | 3 – High), and 2. The customers’ performance score against each PS criterion (1 – Exemplary | 2 – Good | 3 – Fair | 4 – Caution | 5 Unacceptable). The combination of these elements leads to a 7-letter scale E&S risk rating (AAA, AA, BBB, BB, CCC, CC, D) for each applicable criterion. Ratings BB/BBB/AA/AAA represent adequate customer E&S risk management per criterion, whilst CCC/CC/D are deemed to be inadequate. The lowest rating that the customer has achieved across all IFC PS criteria is used as the overall customer ESG performance rating. Performance is monitored over the lifetime of the investment. Validation by external body other than the assurance provider (if applicable) NA Unit Number 2024 54 The following table provides an overview of the current E&S performance gaps we have identified and how we engage with these customers.

"table 11). These performance gaps have been summarized by theme in the table that follows which illustrates the high priority issues that still require attention. Table 12. E&S performance gaps E&S performance gaps 2024 Description Our engagement ESRS topic Willingness and commitment (PS1) (n=7) Resistance to engage on E&S issues can stem from over- reliance on DFIs to drive ESG work streams. Commitment can waver due to financial, operational and contextual difficulties. Wavering commitment can have tangible implications on human rights and the environment, for example through delays in implementing management plans or community benefits, or in conducting specialized studies. We use contractual leverage on specific E&S items, raise issues with customers’ top management and exert influence on their boards, e.g. to push for the improvement of organizational culture. - Environmental and social governance and budget (PS1) (n=9) The customer’s leadership is not fully aware of and involved with E&S performance management, and/or has not allocated sufficient budget, resources, or time. Governance issues can result in poor protection of workers’ rights, a range of risks to communities, as well as damage to the environment. We use contractual leverage and escalate the issue to top management. We may offer capacity building and advice on integrating E&S costs into financial planning and monitor frequently. - Identification and assessment of risks and impacts (PS1) (n=8) Weak (initial and ongoing) identification and mitigation of risks. This can adversely impact human rights. We provide customers with continuous engagement with our ESG staff and capacity building. If needed, we exert formal pressure e.g. through withholding additional financing or triggering default. - Environmental and social management system (PS1) (n=13) Since the assessment and management of E&S risks and impacts is part of a larger set of processes that the customer uses to manage its projects, the customer needs to deploy an environmental and social management system (ESMS) to warehouse and utilize such processes. A weak system hampers the ability to identify issues or risks, and through that to improve E&S performance, and so can lead to adverse economic, financial, social, and environmental impacts. We support customers in the development and improvement of an ESMS. - Organizational capacity and competency (PS1) (n=10) E&S teams can be too small, change often, continue to perform poorly, or lack qualified staff. This is an issue in countries where environmental legislation is developing, and/or state human rights policy and practice are weak. We use contractual leverage, offer capacity building and look for competent staff in our network. - Stakeholder engagement, external communication, grievance mechanisms (PS1) (n=16) Trust and communication between FMO’s customer and its stakeholders are eroding or have broken down. Ineffective channels of communication play an important part here, particularly when grievances are insufficiently captured or redressed. Poor performance in this area can infringe on the freedom of opinion and expression, and even result in inhuman treatment, retaliation, and risk to lives. We intensify our customer engagement, offer to connect customers to experts, mediate or provide capacity building. S3 Affected communities Voluntary land rights transfer (PS1) (n=2) Customer needs to demonstrate that the buyer and the seller were both willing to transfer the land. Involuntary land transfer can be masked as voluntary, which can weaken community cohesion, cause tension between company and community and affect people’s livelihoods. We engage with our customers to help them establish a land acquisition process that shows both the buyer and seller are willingly transferring the land. S3 Affected communities Working conditions and management of workers relationship (incl. third party workers) (PS2) (n=14) Project workers working in substandard conditions, unaware of their rights or without access to grievance mechanisms.

"Supply chain working conditions (PS2) (n=3) When the customer does not monitor its primary supply chain, risks or incidents affecting vulnerable groups are not adequately addressed. We require customers with supply chains susceptible to high human rights or environmental risks to conduct a supply chain risk assessment. In some cases, they also need to develop a leverage plan and/or action plan to mitigate those risks.

Processes and procedures are unclear, E&S management responsibilities are insufficiently defined and/or capabilities are lacking, or inadequate E&S due diligence and monitoring is performed. This can be compounded by lack of exposure to and experience in E&S risks management by the financial sector and the lack of a level-playing field. This can lead to infringements of all types of human rights as referenced before. We provide expertise and funding for the ESMS or sit on E&S risk management committees. We negotiate improvement plans and, in some cases, initiate or contribute to sector initiatives. - ESG performance target While we monitor all negative impacts in our portfolio, FMO's ESG performance target is set annually for high-ESG risk customers contracted prior to 2024 (identified as the ‘target list’). The target list includes high E&S risk customers and customers with a corporate governance officer in the deal. We register and monitor all potential negative impacts of our high-risk customers and aim to have at least 90 percent of ESG risks in our target list managed at an adequate level by our customers. The 2024 results indicate that, on average, 94 percent of ESG risks were adequately managed. In instances where customer performance deteriorates or open action items are not implemented on time, customers receive lower ratings, which bring down the average of the entire portfolio.

"E3 Water and Marine Resources E3 Introduction FMO recognizes the critical role of water management in supporting climate and nature goals, ecosystems, and economic development. FMO invests in projects dependent on freshwater resources in the water, energy and agrifood portfolios, and impacts are expected regarding both water quality and water availability. As part of the impact management strategy, FMO has an ambition to invest in water efficient projects that align with the wider goals of environmental protection, safeguard affected communities, and ensure the sustainable use of water resources. By addressing water impacts, FMO aims to contribute to sustainable development and help mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on water resources. E3 Impacts, risks and opportunities The following table provides an overview of how each impact, risk and opportunity (IRO) relates to the policies, actions and targets respectively. The impacts caused by our own operations fell below the materiality threshold. However, two negative impacts in our investment portfolio are considered to be material. It should be noted that the double materiality assessment (DMA) for E1 on Climate included a Climate Risk Assessment, through which a material financial risk related to water dependency was identified. This risk will be reported under 'E1 Climate change' as it relates to climate change effects that lead to increased water scarcity. Table 23. Overview of how each IRO relates to the policies, actions and targets respectively ESRS Subtopic Material impact, risk, opportunity Description Short description & reasonably expected time horizons of the impacts Value chain location Policy Actions Targets Water withdrawals Actual negative impact The actual negative impacts on water quality and availability resulting from significant water usage or degradation by customers and/or projects financed by FMO.

The Sustainability Policy is mostly related to our (positive and negative) impacts in our downstream value chain and is part of the Sustainability Policy Universe. The ESG management approach for screening and monitoring customers with regard to potential negative impacts on local communities are described in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'.

"Additionally, customers engaged in primary production of living natural resources, such as forestry and agriculture, are required to manage these resources sustainably using industry-specific good management practices (IFC PS6) and this is to be demonstrated by independent verification or certification. Furthermore, in cases where customers are purchasing primary production (such as food and fiber commodities) from areas with a known potential negative impact of significant conversion of natural and/or critical habitats, FMO requires that these customers implement systems and verification practices to identify where the supply originates, the type of habitat of the area, review supply chains and limit procurement from suppliers where these impacts are identified (IFC PS6 and IFC PS1). Moreover, customer activities can negatively impact local communities in the following ways: 1. A customer’s operations may directly negatively impact priority ecosystem services that can result in adverse health and safety impacts on local communities (IFC PS4). For example, customer activities in the agricultural sector can result in the loss of natural buffer areas such as wetlands and mangroves which mitigate the effects of natural hazards such as landslides and flooding, thus resulting in increased vulnerability and community safety-related risks and impacts. Some of these impacts can be exacerbated by climate change (IFC PS4). 2. Customer operations can also negatively impact local communities whose livelihoods are dependent on biodiversity in these areas or ecosystem services (IFC PS1). These negative impacts should be identified and avoided. If deemed unavoidable, then customers are required to implement appropriate mitigative measures (IFC PS4) in consultation with affected local communities (IFC PS1). The process used by FMO to identify and manage IROs to local communities is described in S3. Throughout the investment process and as part of our due diligence, we assess our customers’ performance against the above standards. The outcome of the assessment is an integral part of the financial proposals that inform our investment decisions. Where negative impacts or gaps in the management of such negative impacts are identified, FMO agrees with the customer on measures and actions to be taken by the customer to close these performance gaps. These actions are formalized in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) which is included in the financing contract with the customer. By collaborating with our customers, we aim to address these gaps in order to effectively manage associated (material) negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. In this manner, FMO sees an opportunity to transform the agriculture sector in our markets through the use of sustainable, resource-efficient and resilient practices and business models throughout agricultural supply chains. We assess our investments for negative impacts and dependencies on nature (as described above) and use this analysis to identify investment opportunities. For example, some investments leave natural forests intact or preserve certain ecosystems while still profitably harvesting products. This is how we turn identified dependencies and negative impacts into opportunities for investment. In addition, the biodiversity-related parts of our Sustainability Policy and associated documents are linked to several other third party standards and initiatives: Our biodiversity commitments are linked to SDG 13 on climate action, as we actively participate in biodiversity efforts by forming partnerships with key conservation organizations, enhancing understanding of landscape approaches, and encouraging community and stakeholder involvement. Additionally, the European Regulation on Deforestation-Free Products (EUDR) came into force in 2023. This regulation requires companies to prove their products are deforestation-free from 30 December 2025. Although it will not affect FMO directly, it will become relevant as it poses a transition risk for many of our agrifood partners. It is applicable downstream, to customers in our portfolio (especially the Agribusiness, Food and Water portfolio). More information on how we consider acting upon this is included section 'E4-3 Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems'. The target of investing €10 billion in SDG 13-related investments by 2030 contributes to the positive impact of FMO and the opportunity for FMO to restore and regenerate ecosystems and create and develop new markets with a biodiversity positive impact.

"A financed activity is either contributing to conserving/increasing biodiversity or the core business/ aim of the project is to conserve or increase biodiversity. The transition to, or maintenance of, silvo-pastoral systems, if no conversion of natural land is involved. Since we did not identify any material biodiversity-or ecosystem-related IROs for FMO’s own operations, we have not adopted any biodiversity and ecosystem protection policies covering FMO’s operational sites. Since FMO’s potential negative impacts through unsustainable land use change or agricultural practices were found to be material, our approach to managing these impacts is described above. The potential positive impact of investing in projects that promote sustainable land use through ecosystem restoration and regeneration is also described above. Sustainable oceans and sea are not material for FMO and therefore no related policies exist. Two policy aspects are relevant to how we address deforestation at FMO. First, FMO uses an exclusion list when evaluating potential investments. Part of this exclusion list is the fact that an investment may not significantly contribute to the conversion or degradation of a critical habitat, like primary or high conservation-value forests. Secondly, the IFC PS6 addresses deforestation by emphasizing the need to protect and conserve biodiversity, maintain ecosystem services, and manage living natural resources sustainably IFC PS6 requires customers to take proactive steps to address deforestation and its impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. E4-3 Key actions We have formulated actions from the reporting period at the operational level, which mainly address the material IROs, and at the strategic level. Additionally, we present the main future planned actions. The scope for these actions concerns our downstream investment portfolio. Operational actions in 2024 1. Increase the Green-labelled share of our portfolio. Investments are assessed based on potential impact and include increasing biodiversity positive-related investments in line with the relevant biodiversity criteria in our Green Label. Our investment teams seek opportunities in biodiversity finance on an ongoing basis. Our Sustainable Finance Advisory team provides investment teams with ongoing support on such transactions. Investment teams receive regular training on the label and opportunities in these focus areas. 2. Keep using and improving the IFC PS6 standard application including training and ESAPs at customer level to manage potential negative impact. Strategic actions in 2024 1. We developed a Biodiversity roadmap that describes how we plan to manage biodiversity impacts, risks and opportunities and increase investments in biodiversity positive finance by 2030. 2. We started developing our methodology to assess our dependency on nature, as part of our climate risk assessment project that is covered in 'E1 Climate change'. 3. We organized a training on managing negative impacts of biodiversity, in line with IFC PS6 to allow staff to upgrade their existing knowledge on the IFC PS6 content or process. Future planned actions 1. Green Label update planned for 2025. 2. KPI development to monitor strategic impact ambitions. We started the development of two KPIs to monitor strategic impact ambitions in 2024, covering both biodiversity opportunities and potential negative impacts; these are expected to be in place earliest in 2026. 3. Continue developing a pipeline for biodiversity financing in line with our strategic commitments. 176 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
RISK MANAGEMENT 03
"the IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) as its operating standard. The following documents are relevant for water: a. IFC PS3, 4 and 6 provide specific guidance on water related topics, as they respectively cover Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention, Community Health, Safety, and Security, and Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources. b. Our Position Statement on Hydropower Plants outlines our approach to investing in hydroelectric projects, emphasizing the balance between harnessing their economic and environmental benefits and rigorously assessing and mitigating potential technical, environmental, and social impacts, including adherence to IFC PS and continuous monitoring. FMO’s policies that address water-related impacts are aimed at reducing the material negative impacts downstream in FMO’s value chain. FMO aims to support customers to improve their sustainable use of natural resources, such as water, and to prevent degradation of ecosystems. FMO assesses its direct and indirect potential and existing investments over time according to ESG criteria such as the presence and quality of the E&S management system, availability, quantity and quality of resources such as water for local communities and related impacts on resource efficiency including the consumption and use of water. The scope of this assessment applies to the financed activities and their primary suppliers, though FMO may look beyond the direct financed activities when salient risks are expected in the value chain. Potable water availability or sanitary wastewater collection, treatment, or discharge are also considered, whereby opportunities are explored to improve these aspects, especially where these can be provided at marginal cost to the project. When projects are a potentially significant consumer of water, in addition to applying the resource efficiency requirements of the IFC PS3, FMO requires its customers to adopt measures (e.g., use of additional water conservation measures, the use of alternative water supplies, water consumption offsets, evaluation of alternative project locations) that avoid or reduce water usage so that the project’s water consumption does not have significant negative impacts. FMO requires that projects implement technically and financially feasible and cost-effective measures for improving efficiency in its consumption of water, integrating the principles of cleaner production into product design and production processes with the objective of conserving water. Policies related to water management pertain to an organization's own operations. Since FMO's own operations were not identified as material in the DMA, this type of water management policies is not relevant for FMO. Since the water-related impacts that were identified to be material for FMO are not related to our own operations, there are no policies required to address water stress near one of FMO’s operating sites. E3-2 Key actions As part of the normal due diligence process, we identify performance gaps against our standards, and we agree with our customers on improvements that are required in relation to negative impacts on water and marine resources (e.g. impact of hazardous materials on ecosystem services, degradation of natural resources, water usage etc.). These improvements are translated into an action plan (ESAP) which is incorporated into the contract. The ESAP also stipulates timelines for the customers to close the actions (see 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'). Compliance with the ESAP and closing of actions is monitored as part of the customer credit review process which takes place annually. Where incidents take place, a corrective action plan may be required to mitigate and possibly remediate the impact; this can be agreed with the customer. E3-3 Targets FMO has not adopted targets related to water resources. However, FMO’s 90 percent ESG performance target includes but is not limited to water impact from related investments (incl. IFC PS3, 4 and 6). Detailed information on this target is provided in 'ESRS 2 – IRO management'. 170 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems E4 Introduction FMO recognizes the value of ecosystems that form the natural capital for the world economy. Their degradation poses a direct risk for FMO’s customers and the societies in which they operate. When we talk about biodiversity, we look at it from a broader perspective, taking into consideration nature and natural capital. While biodiversity and nature are not always explicitly singled out as specific objectives in the way FMO manages on sustainability-related matters (see 'ESRS 2 - IRO Management'). FMO’s impact management procedures are aligned with environmental conservation, sustainable use of natural resources, and protection of ecosystems. Furthermore, they promote consideration of how investments affect biodiversity and the pursuit of investments that support nature-based solutions and conservation goals. FMO aims to achieve positive impacts through biodiversity finance that are focused on for instance nature-based solutions and forestry- and regenerative agriculture investments. As per the 2030 Strategy, FMO aims to increase the volume of investments contributing to biodiversity. Together with our partners, FMO committed to engage on climate adaptation and resilience, and biodiversity, by creating coalitions with key nature conservancy organizations, contributing to the understanding of the landscape approach, promoting community and stakeholder engagement.

Opportunity to develop new biodiversity positive markets Downstream (AFW portfolio) Sustainability Policy Increase volume of investments related to biodiversity. No specific target We identified biodiversity and ecosystems to be a material topic because of our potential and actual positive and negative impacts from our investments in the agrifood, water, and energy sectors (downstream value chain), and because of the developments in biodiversity-positive financing markets that can create material opportunities for FMO. However, currently we do not consider biodiversity a material topic from the financial risk perspective. For more details, please refer to our double materiality assessment process (DMA) as described in 'ESRS 2 - Double materiality assessment'. As part of our assessment on the materiality of the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems in our own operations and downstream value chain we conducted desk research into the agrifood, water and energy sectors looking into international sector standards, peers, trends, and media coverage. Additionally, we considered FMO’s 2030 Strategy and current ways of working (such as our ESG management process, climate risk assessment, Green Label assessments, and forestry strategy). As such, we took into consideration impact drivers such as climate change, land-use change, the impact on marine and freshwater-use, direct exploitation and invasive alien species and pollution, as well as impacts on the state of species, impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems and impacts and dependencies on ecosystem services. While our DMA was being conducted, we were also in the process of creating a methodology to assess our dependency on nature. As this methodology was still in early stages of development during the reporting period, we did not take it into consideration during our DMA. For the methodology to assess dependencies on nature we are applying the ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure) materiality ratings to help evaluate our exposure to nature- 172 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"related risks, and to better understand our dependencies and impacts on nature. We expect to continue developing our methodology and improving our ways of assessing dependencies and risks related to biodiversity and ecosystems. Our Climate Risk Report (see 'E1 - Impact, Risk and opportunity management') formed part of the input for the material risks and opportunities determined in our DMA. Our climate risk assessment explicitly covers physical and transition risks related to climate change, which also indirectly impacts nature, biodiversity and ecosystems. Within the climate risk assessment, the relevant risks for biodiversity and ecosystems are sometimes direct and sometimes indirect (as climate change can affect ecosystems and biodiversity). These risks have been covered as material under 'E1 Climate Change' and we did not find any additional material nature-related risks during our DMA. The outcome of our DMA concluded that biodiversity-related outside-in financial risks are currently not material to FMO. However, as our methodology to assess our dependency on nature continues to develop, we may identify material biodiversity-related risks in the future. Exploring biodiversity-related opportunities has been embedded into our 2030 Strategy, in which we aim to increase the volume of investments contributing to biodiversity as part of our SDG 13 ambition through the growth of our Green Label investments portfolios. As our methodology for assessing dependency on nature is still under development and was not considered during the DMA, we have not yet taken systemic risks into consideration. We did not consult with potentially affected communities specifically for the purposes of the DMA. As discussed in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management', we apply the relevant IFC Performance Standards (IFC PS) in our investment process and due diligence, which may require consultation of potentially affected communities (depending on the investment) in order to avoid causing negative impacts on communities. Our approach towards affected communities is described further in our ESRS statement 'S3 Affected communities'. As the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems is not material to FMO’s own operations, the potential impacts on ecosystem services of relevance to affected communities in FMO’s own operations are not applicable. FMO does not have sites of its own that can create material impacts on biodiversity. Some of our investments can take place in physical locations that may be in or near biodiversity sensitive areas. We manage potential negative impacts in our investment process with the implementation of IFC PS6 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources). We assess on an individual project level whether it is necessary to implement climate mitigation measures. Our relevant process is described further in the section 'E4-2 Policies'. E4-1 Transition plan We identified material potential positive and negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems in our downstream value chain. Additionally, we are developing our methodology on how to assess our dependencies on nature, and we are in the process of identifying potential risks from ecosystem degradation, regulatory and market shifts, climate change and biodiversity loss. Lastly, we have identified biodiversity-related opportunities as part of our 2030 Strategy, where we aim to increase the volume of investments contributing to biodiversity towards our SDG 13 ambition and Green Label growth target. As discussed in the previous section of this statement and in section 'ESRS 2 - Double materiality assessment', no material biodiversity and ecosystems-related risks were identified during the DMA. Therefore, our conclusion from our DMA is that FMO is resilient in terms of biodiversity and ecosystems. The DMA covered FMO’s upstream and downstream value chain, and FMO’s own operations. The time horizons used for the DMA were in line with the time horizons mentioned in ESRS 1. Furthermore, no specific stakeholder engagement was performed for the purposes of the DMA on the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems. 173 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"As mentioned before, during the reporting period we were developing our methodology to assess FMO’s risks and dependencies related to nature. This methodology covers our entire portfolio (downstream value chain). This work is still in its early stages, and we expect that as we continue to develop our methodology further in the coming years, our understanding of FMO’s resilience in terms of biodiversity and ecosystems will also evolve. Lastly, during the reporting period, we developed our ‘Biodiversity roadmap’ to outline how we plan to address impacts, risks and opportunities in biodiversity, and increase investments in biodiversity positive finance in line with our 2030 Strategy (see 'E4-3 Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems'). E4-2 Policies Our material potential impacts related to the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems are mainly addressed by one policy: the Sustainability Policy and the relevant supporting documents, which together form the FMO Sustainability Policy Universe (SPU). Our 2030 Strategy and Climate Action Plan describe FMO’s commitment to increase investments in biodiversity. Below is a description of the relevant documents within the SPU: Our Sustainability Policy and related underlying documents outline how we manage our material biodiversity-related IROs. A complete description of the Sustainability Policy is described in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'. Our Position Statement on Hydropower Plants outlines our approach to investing in hydroelectric projects, emphasizing the balance between harnessing their economic and environmental benefits and rigorously assessing and mitigating potential technical, environmental, and social (E&S) impacts, including adherence to IFC PS and continuous monitoring. This emphasizes mandatory consultation with the local population affected by the project and specific plans available to compensate for any negative effects. Exclusion list: FMO’s exclusion list requires that an investment may not result in the ‘significant conversion or degradation of critical habitats’. Primary forests or forests of a high conservation value are classified as critical habitats. ESG management. The general criteria for screening and monitoring customers with regard to negative/adverse impacts on local communities are described in 'ESRS 2 - IRO management'. The following standards are relevant for biodiversity: i. IFC PS1: Assessment and management of environmental and social risks and impacts in relation to communities as well as disadvantaged and vulnerable groups ii. IFC PS6: Biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources iii. IFC PS3 and 4 address the impacts of customer activities on ecosystem services and areas of importance to biodiversity that affect local communities Green Label Guidelines: the Green Label Guidelines provide the methodology and criteria for how to identify investments that are ex ante expected to have the positive impact we aim to create through our portfolio, including when it comes to preserving and growing natural capital and promoting biodiversity. FMO’s material biodiversity-related IROs are provided in the overview Table at the start of this chapter. These cover the relevant biodiversity drivers mentioned in the application requirements for ESRS E4 (with the exception of pollution which was not identified as a material topic for FMO) and ecosystem-related impacts, risks and opportunities. In practice, our ESG management process involves identifying, managing and monitoring potential and actual negative impacts caused by our customers in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems. Ecosystem services are the benefits that people, including businesses, derive from ecosystems. FMO requires customers to identify and avoid negative impacts on biodiversity or ecosystems. Specifically, this requires customers to identify potential negative impacts (IFC PS1 and IFC PS6) such as habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, possibility of invasive alien species introduction, overexploitation of a habitat and pollution (IFC PS3) that arise as a result of their activities. Where these potential negative impacts cannot be avoided, mitigation strategies and measures (e.g., avoiding impacts through exclusion of land areas within a site for conservation, introducing biological corridors, habitat restoration during or after operations etc.) are to be developed by our customers to minimize the negative impacts (IFC PS6). 174 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"

Since FMO’s potential negative impacts through unsustainable land use change or agricultural practices were found to be material, our approach to managing these impacts is described above. The potential positive impact of investing in projects that promote sustainable land use through ecosystem restoration and regeneration is also described above. Sustainable oceans and sea are not material for FMO and therefore no related policies exist. Two policy aspects are relevant to how we address deforestation at FMO. First, FMO uses an exclusion list when evaluating potential investments. Part of this exclusion list is the fact that an investment may not significantly contribute to the conversion or degradation of a critical habitat, like primary or high conservation-value forests. Secondly, the IFC PS6 addresses deforestation by emphasizing the need to protect and conserve biodiversity, maintain ecosystem services, and manage living natural resources sustainably IFC PS6 requires customers to take proactive steps to address deforestation and its impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. E4-3 Key actions We have formulated actions from the reporting period at the operational level, which mainly address the material IROs, and at the strategic level. Additionally, we present the main future planned actions. The scope for these actions concerns our downstream investment portfolio. Operational actions in 2024 1. Increase the Green-labelled share of our portfolio. Investments are assessed based on potential impact and include increasing biodiversity positive-related investments in line with the relevant biodiversity criteria in our Green Label. Our investment teams seek opportunities in biodiversity finance on an ongoing basis. Our Sustainable Finance Advisory team provides investment teams with ongoing support on such transactions. Investment teams receive regular training on the label and opportunities in these focus areas. 2. Keep using and improving the IFC PS6 standard application including training and ESAPs at customer level to manage potential negative impact. Strategic actions in 2024 1. We developed a Biodiversity roadmap that describes how we plan to manage biodiversity impacts, risks and opportunities and increase investments in biodiversity positive finance by 2030. 2. We started developing our methodology to assess our dependency on nature, as part of our climate risk assessment project that is covered in 'E1 Climate change'. 3. We organized a training on managing negative impacts of biodiversity, in line with IFC PS6 to allow staff to upgrade their existing knowledge on the IFC PS6 content or process. Future planned actions 1. Green Label update planned for 2025. 2. KPI development to monitor strategic impact ambitions. We started the development of two KPIs to monitor strategic impact ambitions in 2024, covering both biodiversity opportunities and potential negative impacts; these are expected to be in place earliest in 2026. 3. Continue developing a pipeline for biodiversity financing in line with our strategic commitments. 176 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"
"Table 25. Minimum Disclosure Requirements for actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems Scope of actions The actions apply to FMO's value chain, with a focus on the downstream value chain. Time horizon · Operational/BAU actions are implemented within the reporting period. · Strategic actions are implemented in the period 2024-2026. · Future actions are all planned within the timeframe of the 2030 strategy. Actions taken to provide for and cooperate in or support the provision of remedy (if applicable) N/A Progress of actions As this is the first year we report within the structure of the ESRS, we do not report progress on actions from prior periods. For more information refer to 'ESRS 2 - Our sustainability reporting approach'. Operational expenditures (OpEx) and/or capital expenditures (CapEx) (if required) No significant operational expenditures (OpEx) and/or capital expenditures (CapEx) related to implementing actions. For more information refer to 'ESRS 2 - Our sustainability reporting approach'. In 'ESRS 2 - Governance of sustainability matters' we provide information on the teams and departments that are involved with the management of material IROs, which relate to the implementation of the operational actions described above. No actions described require significant OpEx or CapEx. In principle, we do not use biodiversity offsets in our action plans. However, on an individual investment level, FMO’s Biodiversity Mitigation hierarchy is based on IFC PS6 and denotes offsetting as a last resort for residual impact after following the implementation of prevention/avoidance, minimization, and restoration measures. Biodiversity offsets adhere to the ’like-for-like or 'better' principle and are designed and implemented to achieve measurable conservation outcomes that can reasonably be expected to result in no net loss of biodiversity and net gain in critical habitats. Additionally, on an individual project level, we identify any needs for offsets and apply specific relevant key performance indicators on a case-by-case basis. The same applies to financing effects and types, areas and quality criteria applied to the offsets. These will therefore not be described in more detail here as they are not part of our action plans. IFC PS6 Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources forms a key element of FMO’s ESG performance assessment of direct high-risk customers. When significant impacts on biodiversity are identified, our projects must develop and implement a Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), which explicitly describe the project’s mitigation strategy and how local and indigenous knowledge and nature-based solutions are incorporated into conservation strategies and actions. FMO ensures its projects consult protected area managers, affected communities, indigenous peoples and other stakeholders. Affected communities should participate in this identification process in accordance with the stakeholder engagement process as defined in IFC PS1. This process involves Indigenous Peoples’ representative bodies and organizations as well as members of the affected communities of indigenous peoples and provide sufficient time for indigenous peoples’ decision-making processes. Our stakeholder engagement process involves disclosure and dissemination of information, consultation and participation, grievance mechanism, and ongoing reporting to affected communities. Where projects are likely to generate adverse E&S impacts to affected communities, FMO will implement a Stakeholder Engagement Plan tailored to their characteristics and interests. Following IFC PS6, FMO makes every reasonable effort to verify that during this process, community representatives represent the views of affected communities and that they can be relied upon to faithfully communicate the results of consultations to their constituents. E4-4 Targets We currently have no specific biodiversity targets to manage the material IROs, and for the time being, we do not intend to set any specific targets. This topic is continuously evolving, which makes it currently challenging to predict progress and set reliable targets. 177 FMO annual report 2024 Report of the MB Report of the SB Risk Management Sustainability Statement Financial Statements ♦"

"Sustainability Statement continued ESRS E4 – Biodiversity and ecosystem SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model E4.SBM-3_05 Through our double materiality assessment, we have identified a material impact within our upstream value chain specifically related to land use change. However, no material impact has been identified in relation to soil degradation, desertification, or soil sealing. E4-1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model E4-1_01 Protection of biodiversity and ecosystems is one of our main sustainability priorities. Our biggest impact on the biodiversity landscape occurs in the upstream segment of our value chain, and it is related to the potential deforestation (land use change) from some agricultural commodities, mostly wood (used for our paper packaging materials). We are committed to eliminate deforestation of our main ingredients by 2025, and it is aligned with the recommendations by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for companies with Forest, Land and Agricultural Activities (FLAG). Due to FLAG recommendations we have updated our net zero plan as stated in ESRS E1. Also, in our Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), we have requirements related to deforestation, and our target is to achieve 100% sustainable sourcing by 2025. We voluntarily report the sites which are adjacent to legally protected areas, and for all of them we have a confirmed ‘no negative impact’ by an external expert which performs so-called Source Vulnerability Assessment for all the water sources we use in direct operations. In 2022, we published our biodiversity statement where we set a goal to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in our operations and supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. The time horizons we use are defined as follows: short-term (2024), medium-term (2025-2030), and long-term (2031-2050). E4-1_02 Environmental risks at supplier level, including deforestation risk, are mitigated through our robust programme at procurement level. We annually review the risks and performance of all our suppliers against our SGPs, PSA principles for agricultural ingredients, Water Risk Assessment, as well as other equally important aspects that impact our business, such as supply risk and financial stability. Overall, it is important to point out that sustainability is one of the key criteria in supplier selection under strategic sourcing, as well as a criterion for the Annual Supplier Review process that we conduct cross-functionally across our supply base. In more detail, to ensure that suppliers demonstrate ESG requirements’ compliance we rely on multiple screening and assessment practices that offer us a holistic view of their performance. This means we collect primary and secondary data that we combine together and analyse to identify priority areas for critical to our operations suppliers. The Sustainable Agriculture programme secures ESG monitoring through PSA certification process of the Coca-Cola System across our main agricultural commodities. For the remaining supply base, we have designed a robust assessment journey leveraging ESG physical audits, as well as a number of globally recognised screening and assessment tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus, EcoVadis Assessments, SEDEX, WWF Water Risk Filter Assessment, Resilience Event Watch, Exiger and Moody’s Analytics. Additionally, annual Supply Base Assessments are carried out by specialist consultants for Group Critical suppliers. These assessments evaluate Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers on various criteria, including water risk, climate change, forced labour, child labour, labour rights, biodiversity, and financial risk. In case of any risk identified, the supplier is asked to provide an action plan which is monitored regularly. For deforestation, we have a specific project in place where we perform readiness assessment for all our supplier under the requirements of EUDR and we are currently organising our internal process to ensure we are able to assess risks and take necessary actions on an on-going basis from the moment that EUDR is formally introduced as of 1st of January 2026.

We have committed to our NetZeroby40 journey since 2021, and the healthy liquidity position of the Group ensures proper funding of relevant initiatives every year. Our climate transition plan, first developed in 2021, covers the full value chain (scope 1, 2 and 3) and it is as per the 1.5 degree scenario, approved by the SBTi. Developed by a cross-functional team of experts, the plan was approved by the ELT (through Sustainability SteerCo) and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the BoD. Coca-Cola HBC considers five main levers and those are the main actions for each lever: 1. Manufacturing (includes scope 1 fuels used, scope 1 losses of CO2 used for beverage carbonation, scope 2 electricity/heat/steam/ hot water purchased) • Continue implementing and accelerating the energy-efficient projects in our plants (deployment of energy saving projects, old equipment modernization, and installation of heat pumps & electrification). • Improving the CO2 yield in the plants. • Accelerating usage of renewable and/ or cleaner energy to replace fossil fuel in scope 1 or electricity/heat/steam/ hot water in scope 2. 2. Transportation (includes scope 1 fuels used for own transport, both light and heavy, and scope 3 fuels used for outsourced logistics and transportation) • Optimising the routes of light and heavy fleet, increasing logistics efficiency and increasing heavy trucks utilization. • Shifting the existing fleet to innovative technologies and renewable or alternative fuels. • Enhancing the strategic partnerships with our third-party logistics providers and joint investments (accelerate shifting to alternative fuels, route to market evolution, shifting of more volume to trains and applying industry innovations). 3. Packaging (includes scope 3 from all primary, secondary and tertiary packaging used for our products) • Implementing our Packaging Mix of the Future strategy (increasing recycled PET, moving from non-reusable one-way glass bottles to reusable glass bottles and providing more packageless solutions). • Implementing decarbonisation of our primary and secondary packaging materials (aluminium cans, PET bottles, glass bottles, plastic labels, closures, stretch films etc.). 4. Ingredients (includes scope 3 from all ingredients used for manufacturing of our beverages) • Decarbonisation initiatives with our suppliers (engagement of farmers through co- development of farming pilots with suppliers, using regenerative agricultural practices). • Continue reformulation of our products and moving to more lights and zero products in our beverage portfolio. 5. Drink Equipment (includes scope 3 of electricity used by our customers for the drink equipment we provide, scope 1 for refrigerant losses from cold drink equipment) • Accelerate the process of providing energy efficient drink equipment to our customers and finding innovative solutions for further energy efficiency of our drink equipment. • Greening the electricity grid mainly in Europe and with slower pace in Africa.

"Sustainability Statement continued commodities, we are proactively collecting deforestation information from all agricultural ingredients suppliers across all our countries in order to have a holistic view of the exposure and potential risk. By the end of 2025, we will have a programme in place to cover any identified gaps. Last but not least, we are in process of implementing a deforestation tracking platform on top of any other activities already in motion, which will also be ready before the end of 2025. E4-1_03, 04, 05 The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has identified five pressures on nature: 1) land/water/sea use change, 2) resource exploitation, 3) climate change, 4) pollution and 5) invasive species. In 2023, we undertook the mapping and materiality assessment on biodiversity across our value chain and we assessed those pressures following the SBTN guideline step 1 and 2. We have collected all our activity data, covering: 1) upstream activities (volumes sourced and origin of raw materials), 2) direct operations (consumption of water and energy of all sites), and 3) downstream (packaging distribution by country). Then we translated the activity data into pressures on nature across five metrics. These pressures on nature were weighted by local nature vulnerability indicators assessing the state of nature in the locations where the activity occurs. Time horizons used in the analysis are as described in E4-1_01. We considered in the assumptions the tighter environmental regulations (e.g., EUDR), carbon pricing policies which would include land conversion activities, deforestation-free commitments from suppliers, and climate risks (e.g., water scarcity, extreme weather events). The result shows that the biggest impact we have is in upstream activities, mainly agricultural suppliers and their impact on land-use change or deforestation. Our procurement strategy to purchase certified raw materials that meet our PSA and our goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chain, support mitigation of the impact and also reduce any potential risk that may occur. E4-1_06 Relevance to stakeholder engagement is described in E4.MDR-T_11. E4-2 Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems E4.MDR-P_01 & E4-2_01, 20 We have adopted policies that address deforestation and sustainable land practices. Our overarching goal for biodiversity is to achieve a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas in supply chain by 2040 and eliminate deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Besides, we have set our Environmental Policy, the main objective of which is to minimise the environmental impact of the Group, and the Biodiversity Statement, the objective of which is to enhance biodiversity by reducing emissions and water use, by preserving and reinstating water priority areas, and by sourcing agricultural ingredients sustainably. Moreover, through the Biodiversity Statement, CCHBC is committed to promoting sustainable forest management and helping protect woodlands from deforestation and illegal harvesting. For the monitoring process, please refer to ESRS E1 section, as it constitutes the standard procedure applicable to all relevant topics. Our policies support biodiversity conservation, sustainable land management, and responsible sourcing. We are committed to achieving a net positive impact on biodiversity in critical areas by 2040 and eliminating deforestation in our supply chain by 2025. Thus, our policies address ecosystem protection, sustainable forest management, and mitigation of environmental impacts. We recognise the importance of biodiversity for long-term resilience, as our Natural Capital Impact Study and Source Vulnerability Assessments (SVA) help identify key dependencies and risks, while sustainable sourcing practices mitigate transition risks. We implement traceability mechanisms through certifications, verification schemes, and supplier requirements aligned with The Coca-Cola Company’s Principles for Sustainable Agriculture and EcoVadis assessments. Moreover, our policies prioritise collaboration with NGOs, communities, and industry stakeholders to ensure sustainable supply chains that respect human rights, promote responsible land use, and protect natural ecosystems. E4.MDR-P_02 The policies are applicable across all geographies where Coca-Cola HBC operates. Among the affected stakeholder groups, farmers, other suppliers and local communities associated with the Group’s upstream value chain, are most significantly impacted. E4.MDR-P_03 Policies/statements related to environment (including biodiversity) are approved and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors, and they apply to all Coca-Cola HBC employees, regardless of level and function. E4.MDR-P_04 & E4-2_02 In June 2022, we joined the SBTN Corporate Engagement Program. We will continue working to implement the SBTN’s guidance, in order to map and assess the material impacts on biodiversity of our critical commodities and suppliers and then set science-based targets in priority areas. E4.MDR-P_05 We engage with a broad range of stakeholder groups for biodiversity, including our communities, governments, NGOs, investors and suppliers, taking into account their recommendations in the process of setting biodiversity-related policy. For more information, please refer to E1 section. E4.MDR-P_06 The Environmental Policy and the Biodiversity Statement are publicly available at our site (Policies | Coca-Cola HBC), which affected stakeholders can easily access. E4-2_03 The critical areas in our supply chain are defined based on the material dependencies that we have in relation to biodiversity, for example the provision of water, agricultural raw materials and wood. E4-2_04 We started mapping all our operations and critical commodities/suppliers. For our sustainability assessment, we use the risk-based approach with the support of our partners (EcoVadis). Transparency and traceability of material supply chains is established through certifications/ verification schemes or by ensuring suppliers have robust traceability of supply that meets our expectations (please see ‘Supplier Engagement, Verification and Assurance’ from TCCC Principles for Sustainable Agriculture). Also, we regularly measure and report on the progress made against our Mission 2025 commitments, and all other commitments, including those related to biodiversity and deforestation. The annual performance is disclosed in our Annual Report and the GRI Content Index, verified by an independent auditor, and published on our website. E4-2_05, 06, 07, 18 We are committed to sourcing 100% of our key ingredients in line with the Principles for Sustainable Agriculture as set out by TCCC. These principles protect and support biodiversity and ecosystems, uphold human and workplace rights, ensure animal health and welfare, and help build thriving communities. They apply to primary production, i.e., at farm level, and form the basis for our continued engagement with Tier 1 suppliers to ensure sustainable long-term supply at a lower environmental impact. This extends in particular to the sections Conservation of Forests, Conservation of Natural Habitats, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Soil Management and Agrochemical Management.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1.SBM-3_02 We have a thoroughly designed Business Resilience programme that enables us to proactively manage risks – and embrace opportunities – so that we grow sustainably and meet our short-, medium- and long-term objectives. One of the most significant risks to our resilience over the longer term is climate change. By proactively preparing for and managing climate risk through our business strategy and capital investments, however, we can harness significant opportunities. E1.SBM-3_03,04 In our resilience analysis conducted in 2024, we used a variety of climate scenarios in our assessment of the potential impact of climate change on our business, including: RCP1.9, in order to be consistent with our Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) commitment and as representation of a best-case scenario from a climate action point of view; RCP4.5, as it represents the stated policy position and provides a midpoint scenario, and; RCP8.5, as the ‘worst- case’ or ‘extreme’ scenario, particularly for physical risks. This enabled us to consider a broad range of drivers and their impact. In considering the cost of carbon emissions, the more ambitious scenarios assume a greater amount of government use of regulation, taxes and levies and hence the higher costs of carbon. However, we also assumed that government intervention would not be consistent across all our markets given our diverse operating territories, and therefore countries were grouped into leaders, followers and laggards in evaluating potential increases in taxes and levies. As around 90% of our carbon emissions are scope 3, we are dependent on suppliers and customers reducing their carbon emissions. In estimating the reduction in overall carbon emissions and our ability to meet our NetZeroby40 targets, we used NGFS data to estimate industry decarbonisation rates which are assumptions built into our internal plans for meeting our NetZeroby40 target. Included in our assessment of the impact of climate change on our production and distribution, we used external data used by the insurance industry which we consider to be robust. However, we note that climate-related data can project general changes under different climate scenarios, but cannot predict the timing and severity of extreme events, which our facilities are most at risk from. We used assumptions on projected increases in insurance premiums from statements made by the insurance industry on the impact of climate change, however, we note that the impact that those projections are based on may not apply to us as they do not take into account the actions we are taking to adapt to and mitigate the impact of environmental changes. We used a number of internal assumptions about production volume increases to 2040 in order to estimate carbon emissions and resource usage, but we recognise that a considerable number of variables, such as domestic growth rates in each of our operating countries, changes in consumer demand and preferences, weather, industry actions and competition and government regulations, may affect those estimates. E1.SBM-3_06 As a result of our resilience analysis, we continued to improve our assessment of the effects of climate change, with a focus on clear targets and robust action plans. This enables us to deliver on our commitments, mitigate risks and take advantage of the opportunities inherent in change. E1.SBM-3_07 We are keenly aware of the importance of delivering on our plans and the potential to adjust our strategy to respond to emerging needs and priorities. We continue to decarbonise our value chain, while updating our net zero transition plan and developing long-term climate scenarios. We are also working towards our bold commitment to achieving a net-positive impact on biodiversity by 2040 in critical areas of our value chain, implementing the guidelines of the Science Based Targets Network, and we shifted our deforestation-free commitment from 2030 to 2025. We continue to expand our partnerships and seek new collaborations, as our ambitious goals and commitments can only be achieved through collective action. With prudent financial risk management, the Group maintains a healthy liquidity position and access to various funding sources. As of 31 December 2024, the Group had €1.6 billion available under €5.0 billion Euro medium term note programme, €0.8 billion available under €1.0 billion Euro-commercial paper programme, undrawn revolving credit facility of €0.8 billion and several bilateral bank loan facilities. None of the Group’s debt facilities are subject to financial covenants that could impact liquidity or access to capital. For further details, refer to Note 25, p.306. Strong treasury governance ensures a consistent supply of committed funding at both central and operational levels, optimising liquidity and funding risk management to secure the most efficient financing solutions. This diversified funding strategy supports both operational and strategic needs, enabling the Group to allocate resources effectively to the net zero transition plan as necessary. Impact, risk and opportunity management E1-2 Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation E1.MDR-P_01, E1-2_01 Our NetZeroby40 commitment is fully aligned with our philosophy to support the socio- economic development of our communities and to make a more positive environmental impact. In accordance with the Climate Change Policy and our overall Environmental Policy, we will: • strive to reduce all our emissions across the value chain as much as possible by: • advancing the reduction of the energy used in our operations; • expanding our use of renewable energy technologies; • deploying more energy-efficient coolers in the marketplace; • accelerating our sustainable packaging agenda and our green fleet; • engaging with relevant stakeholders to combat climate change; • working with suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint and to minimise their climate impacts; and • setting roadmaps for emissions reduction for all our operations and the main steps in the value chain. • keep CO2 emission reduction targets as one of the elements of our long-term management incentive plans; • work with other partners (industries, academia, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), governments, etc.) on climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation; • consider all climate risks and opportunities and integrate them in our business strategy; • investigate the opportunities for finding solutions for our residual emissions, such as biological and/or technological removals; • monitor, report and audit our GHG emissions, targets, results and activities, and publish transparently our progress in our public files.

We have not identified direct harm to any stakeholders’ group from our actual impact. All actions we take are towards decarbonisation by following the applicable regulatory, industry and international standards. E1.MDR-A_05 In 2024, we made progress on our climate-related actions and plans and for the fourth consecutive year we reached our annual roadmap: • continued our decarbonisation journey in all five levers in alignment with our NetZeroby40 roadmap; • focused on packaging decarbonisation using a higher percentage of recycled materials and improving percentage packaging collection; • supported further roll-out of Deposit Return Schemes in our EU markets; • promoted Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies and the launch of new packaging collection systems in priority markets; • cooperated with eight other industry players and three organisations to publish CSR Europe Biodiversity Alliance White Paper “How Companies in Europe Address Biodiversity’; • expanded our partnerships in water and waste reduction. In 2021, we committed to achieve net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040. This is our most ambitious, complex and forward-looking commitment. We were among the first companies to adopt science-based reduction targets. In our existing net zero roadmap, our starting point is 2017, the baseline for our science-based targets. We have reduced our absolute total value chain emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 31% (excluding Egypt) from 2010 to the end of 2024, our absolute value chain reduction in 2024 versus 2017 is 18% (excluding Egypt). These results come from our sustained investment and focus, and highlight our consistent approach to decarbonisation. Reducing carbon emissions is the non-negotiable goal for our business. We continued to work across our value chain to reduce emissions, with a particular focus on energy efficiency and renewal, packaging, coolers and ingredients. We do this because we will make the biggest progress by delivering sustainable solutions in these parts of our value chain.

"Sustainability Statement continued E1-3_07,08, E1-1_04,06,08 As detailed in the EU Taxonomy section of this sustainability statement, our core economic activity is not yet included in the published Delegated Acts and is therefore not considered Taxonomy-eligible at this stage. However, we have assessed secondary activities that contribute to climate change mitigation. In 2024, 0.67% of total Capex was Taxonomy-aligned, also driven by activities connected to our climate transition plan. Specifically, CCM4.25 ‘Production of heat/cool using waste heat’ , CCM7.4 ‘Installation, maintenance, and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings’ and CE1.1 ‘Manufacture of plastic packaging goods’ contributed to aligned Capex. We have also assessed CCM6.5 ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars, and light commercial vehicles’, which relates to the electrification of our fleet. Although a significant part of our fleet meets the TSC, due to challenges with the DNSH criteria, we will claim zero alignment to EU Taxonomy in 2024. Looking ahead, we expect to maintain or increase EU Taxonomy alignment as we continue to evaluate investment plans and operational expenditures in areas that could become eligible with the introduction of regulatory updates. Metrics and targets E1-4 Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation E1.MDR-T_01,02,03,05,06,07, E1-4_01,24 NetZeroby40 Multiple climate scenarios have been taken into consideration, as outlined in SBM-3_08_09_10, helping assess external drivers, including policy developments and market shifts. In October 2021, we announced our NetZeroby40 transition plan, as part of our commitment to reach net zero absolute emissions across all scopes by 2040. This target is fully aligned with the 1.5 degree pathway, and it was approved by the SBTi in December 2024 (link to the SBTi website). NetZeroby40 is a carbon emissions roadmap including our base-year results, year-on-year emissions targets, 2030 near-term and our 2040 net zero targets. The plan’s main targets are: Overall net-zero target: • Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by 2040. Near-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 27.5% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 33.3% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.* Coca- Cola HBC AG commits to no deforestation across its primary deforestation-linked commodities, with a target date of December 31, 2025. * The target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Long-term targets: • Energy & Industry: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% by 2040 from a 2019 base year. Coca- Cola HBC AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 90% within the same timeframe. • FLAG: Coca-Cola HBC AG commits to reduce absolute scope 3 FLAG GHG emissions by 72% by 2040 from a 2019 base year.* * This target includes FLAG emissions and removals. Science-based targets: please see above. Mission 2025 Developed in 2018, Mission 2025 is a set of sustainability commitments based on our stakeholder materiality matrix and aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their targets. It spans across six key focus areas to cover our entire value chain, including emissions reduction, with the following commitments: • Reduce direct carbon emissions ratio by 30% vs 2017. • 50% of our refrigerators in customer outlets will be energy efficient. • 50% of total energy used in our plants will be from renewable and clean sources. • 100% of the total electricity used in our plants in EU and Switzerland will be from renewable and clean source. E1.MDR-T_04 Our recently approved by the SBTi targets for reducing scope 1 and 2 and scope 3 emissions have organisation-wide coverage. We are covering 100% of our operational activities.E1.MDR-T_10 As previously mentioned, our climate change commitments cover our entire Company, all scope 1, 2, 3, and we aim to reach net zero emissions across the entire value chain by 2040 as per the 1.5 degree scenario, as well as our intermediate emissions reduction target by 2030 is approved by the SBTi. E1.MDR-T_08 The Group’s annual roadmap of net zero target by 2040 is shown in the net zero chart in the strategic part of the IAR, section ‘License to operate’, page 25. Mission 2025 targets related to climate and energy are disclosed in the Strategic Report, ‘Key performance indicators’ section on pages 33 to 34. Those targets don’t have interim targets, but only annual roadmaps at Group level disaggregated further down per BU. E1.MDR-T_09, E1-4_22 At the end of 2020, we set and received approval by the SBTi of our Science-Based Targets by 2030, as our previous SBT period-closing was end of 2020. Those targets are reported in the 2024 IAR (as an old roadmap): Reduction of absolute scope 1, 2 emissions by 55% by 2030 vs 2017 baseline following the 1.5 degree global warming scenario and reduction of scope 3 emissions by 21% by 2030 vs. 2017. So far, we have achieved 31% reduction of our operational emissions vs 2017 (excluding Egypt). Those approved by the SBTi targets are without the integrated new acquisition, Coca-Cola HBC Egypt operations, as its integration happened in 2022, after targets submission and approval in 2021.For the newest targets, approved by the SBTi in December 2024, please refer to previous page (Net Zero targets and FLAG targets). We report as per the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. We are covering 100% of our operational activities. We account and report all seven GHG emissions and report those as equivalent to CO2. Under scope 2 emissions, we are reporting market-based GHG emissions and separately the location-based scope 2 emissions. Our climate targets are also aligned with the UN SDG Target 13.1, i.e. strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries, as well as Targets 7.2 and 7.3 on increased renewable energy and energy efficiency. We do not use any carbon removal nor neutralisation or off-setting/insetting methodologies to achieve our GHG internal annual roadmap targets as per the SBTi guidelines. E1.MDR-T_11 The Group sets measurable, outcome-oriented and time-bound targets on material sustainability matters through a structured and inclusive process. Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions are taken, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. The UN SDGs also form a crucial foundation for the Group’s target- setting process, guiding our efforts in addressing global sustainability challenges. Through this comprehensive approach, the Group ensures that its targets are relevant, ambitious and responsive to both stakeholder input and global standards.

We took into consideration the best global practices and guidelines such as the SBTN, FAO Good Agricultural Practices, ILO and EU regulations. Targets are monitored quarterly by obtaining information from suppliers for their sustainable certifications. The amount of procured quantity of raw materials certified is divided by the total procured volume for the raw materials in scope. Current status is as per the initial plans. Targets are set for the upstream part of the value chain due to the biggest impact there. E4.MDR-T_10 & E4-4_05 The targets set are in line with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and its mission to halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery, and they are aligned with EU 2030 Biodiversity Strategy, where the goal for protecting 30% of land in the EU is stated as well as with the EU Regulation on Deforestation-free Products (EU DR). E4.MDR-T_11 Stakeholder engagement plays a pivotal role in this process, particularly through our Annual Stakeholder Forums, where key discussions take place, and the insights gathered are integrated into the formulation of our targets. Also, during the supplier sustainability events we organise regularly, we discuss different ESG aspects, including biodiversity and deforestation. Additionally, the Group takes into account the requirements of ESG raters, including those of our investors, ensuring that our targets are aligned with their evolving expectations. Moreover, we have conducted several meetings with our main sugar and sweeteners suppliers where we discussed environmental topics, among them the deforestation issue. E4-5 Impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change E4-5_04 Our operations are primarily based in cities, so we do not have a direct impact on biodiversity and ecosystem change.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-A_04 As seen, we have established a comprehensive action plan and implemented several actions related to circular economy and packaging. By those actions, we demonstrate our support to nature and to people independently on whether they are harmed or not. In 2024, no negative incident related to circular economy has been recorded. Financial Resources E5.MDR-A_06, 07, 09, 11 Specifically, to support our actions related to the expansion of reusable/refillable packaging, we make investments every year for the renewal or increase of the returnable containers fleet. In 2024, this investment reached €59 million. We also invested €9.5 million in production infrastructure, mainly for new returnable glass production lines in Italy and Nigeria. In addition, we invest significant amounts to support our action plan around the increase of recycled content in our packaging, specifically by expanding the use of recycled PET. Building on the significant in-house rPET production infrastructure investments we have made in the past few years in Italy, Poland and Romania, we allocated €30 million in 2024 to support the higher cost of recycled PET compared with virgin PET. The Capex and cost of packaging materials mentioned above are reflected in our ‘Financial Statements’, in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. Moving ahead, we will continue to support our circular economy action plan as required. Specifically for 2025, we plan to continue our investments in production infrastructure in Italy to support the RGB expansion in the market, and we will allocate significant Capex on returnable containers across our markets. We also expect that the higher spend for recycled PET compared with virgin PET will increase further to approximately €60 million, as we accelerate our performance against our Mission 2025 target, but also due to the EU requirement for a 25% minimum recycled content on PET beverage bottles. To support our actions, financial resources must be secured through targeted allocation. Our sustainable finance approach underpins the Group’s ability to align funding strategies with sustainability commitments, while supporting the UN SDGs and the EU Environmental Objectives. Financing mechanisms include a diverse range of instruments, ensuring flexibility in meeting both current and future financial requirements for action plans. Metrics and targets E5-3 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3_01 We have set voluntary targets that promote circular economy, and they are designed to address both resource inflows and outflows, and the lifecycle of products and materials. E5-3_02 Our objective is to keep our primary packaging 100% recyclable by design. Therefore, we have established a target related to circular product design, which is already achieved. We have made our primary packaging 100% fully recyclable three years ahead of the expected timeline and 2025 target. For us, recyclability is calculated as technical recyclability by design, and here we consider all beverage packaging which is made of glass, aluminium/steel, PET and aseptic cartons. All of those are able to be recycled fully. We consider as technical recyclability by design any reuse or recycle option for those materials. In the definition, we do not take into consideration the packaging collection rates in every country. E5-3_03 & E5-3_04 Our resource inflows targets focus on the continuous improvement of recycled material use. They have a double role, since by increasing their recycled content, the rates of primary raw materials decline. The targets refer to the recycled PET used for plastic bottles. Furthermore, we aim to remove an additional 2,800 tonnes of our light-weight packaging by 2025 compared with 2023 data. E5-3_05 & E5-3_09 As already stated, we aim to source all our paper- based primary packaging materials from sustainable forest sources. Now, 100% of our paper bricks (aseptic carton) we use are FSC®-certified. Driven by the materiality results, and focusing on the material topics, our targets address the prevention layer (including the reduction) of the waste hierarchy pyramid, as well as recycling and recovering. Returnable glass bottles address reuse layer of the waste hierarchy. E5.MDR-T_01 The majority of those targets are connected with the Packaging Waste Management Policy and reflect total Group targets. To track our performance and our contribution to the final target, every year we set a yearly target as an annual milestone. E5.MDR-T_12 For our targets we use actual data to report the progress, e.g., for recyclability we use the technical by design data of our primary packaging materials (glass, PET, aluminium/steel can, paper, aseptic paper). Our time horizons could be an annual goal aligned with the Business Planning process (BP), mid-term targets aligned with our long-range plan (LRP) and business objectives, or long-term targets such as NetZeroby40 aligned with the external trends. All those targets, however, are disaggregated to annual roadmaps, and our regular performance review is two-pronged: a) versus the annual roadmap; and b) versus the direction of the target year. On this way, we are able to set actions and correct course if needed. E5-3_01 & E5-3_09 & E5.MDR-T_02 – E5.MDR-T_08 Table 28 below provides further details on each target, including their characteristics (targets’ level, their units, their time-boundaries, the progress made over the baseline measurements), illustrating how they contribute to our overall sustainability goals and circular economy principles.

We also launched MYcroLearnings across all our markets as five-minute bitesize online sessions offered every two weeks to our entire sales force to reinforce foundational and critical elements of sales capabilities. When it comes to investing in our supply chain talent, we launched the Supply Chain Academy to approximately 95% of all supply chain personnel across manufacturing, logistics, quality, planning and procurement. In 2023, we launched our Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Academy, partnering with credible European academia. The programme is long term, continuing in 2024 and 2025.

For this reason, the following policy is applicable to Coca-Cola HBC employees, contractors, visitors and individuals across all our operations and sites (i.e., 100% of CCH people working in our premises are covered, including contractors working in our premises). We deliver our OH&S policy programme through a structured implementation of the occupational health and safety management system ISO 45001. Adjustments for disabilities: in every office and manufacturing plant we have facilities adjusted for people with disabilities, such as ramps, lifts and toilets. We have established several Healthy working environment initiatives focusing on ergonomic workplace, illumination, noise, indoor air quality and humidity. For each of these, specific design requirements are described in our Engineering Specifications, and regular trainings are offered to the employees (e.g., via specific Toolbox Talks).

"Sustainability Statement continued Strategy SBM-3 Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model S2.SBM-3_01, 02, 03, 05, 06 At CCHBC, all value chain workers who may be materially impacted by our operations are included in the scope of disclosures under ESRS 2. This encompasses addressing impacts linked to our own operations and value chain, including those arising from our products, services and business relationships. We specifically report on key areas such as secure employment, adequate wages, health and safety, gender equality, equal pay for work of equal value, and training and skills development. Types of value chain workers We consider value chain workers, workers working on our sites, but who are not part of own workforce, i.e., who are not self-employed workers or workers provided by third-party undertakings primarily engaged in employment activities. In essence: • They are outsourced to a separate company that manages its own staff; • Coca-Cola HBC does not directly control the workers; instead, it has a business relationship with the service provider; • The responsibility for managing and employing the workers lies with the service provider, even if the work is performed at CCHBC’s premises; • The external service provide retains responsibility for hiring, managing and supervising, and CCHBC has a business relationship with the service provider, not the individual workers. Examples include pickers and forklift drivers in our warehouses, workers sorting our empty reusable bottles at our plant facilities, cleaning services workers and workers working at our wastewater treatment facilities in the plants and drivers of the delivery trucks by our outsourced logistics. We also consider value chain workers, a variety of workers in the supply base that execute various activities either in an office context or within the agricultural sector and industrial sectors. Our supply base focus is Tier 1 suppliers and aspire to cover for the Tier 2 or below suppliers through the Supplier’s commitment on SGPs or PSA in the case of agricultural ingredients. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of vendors must acknowledge acceptance of CCH SGPs before they can proceed to work with us across sectors and sourcing categories and are monitored on compliance through various tools depending on complexity and criticality of their operations. Specifically, the Strategic Group Suppliers, we actively ask them to confirm ESG compliance including social and human rights attributes, for their critical supply base, i.e. T2 layer or below for CCH. This equally includes white and blue collar works across industries. Specifically for agricultural suppliers, we aspire to cover 100% of our supply base through PSA certifications provided by third-party specialists, which are specifically covering through audits, the practices of farmers and their positioning towards workers of the land such as SAI FSA, ISCC Plus, BONSUCRO, REDcert2, Rainforest Alliance, FairTrade International, Global GAP+GRASP, Global GAP+FSA Add-On, UNILEVER SAC, etc. Our negative effect We have no widespread or systemic material negative impacts on value chain workers in contexts where we operate. Regardless of the high occupational health and safety standards we require by our contractors and service providers, we still report lost time accidents which is the reason to consider negative impact there. Any occupational health and safety incidents are individual. One value chain worker’s fatality was reported in 2024. The contractor lost-time incidents frequency rate (LTIFR) in 2024 is decreasing to 1.31 compared to 1.72 in 2023.

"Sustainability Statement continued E5.MDR-T_12 & E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_01 We have not changed any of our targets, as for us any sustainability target means to deliver, to execute – an opposite of an aspirational target. The Single Use Plastics Directive, which was introduced after our 2025 commitments, applies only to EU Member States. However, we have voluntarily extended these commitments to include our other markets, ensuring they reflect our entire value chain. E5-3_13 & E5.MDR-T_09 The Single Use Plastics Directive imposed in 2019 a 77% separate collection target of PET beverage bottles by 2025 and a recycled content target of 25% in PET beverage bottles. For our collection targets, these were set in 2018, following a previous commitment of 40% total packaging collected by 2020, which we had already overachieved in 2018. For 2025, we have set ambitious targets as an average for all our markets. Not all markets are in the EU, therefore the 75% on average was much more ambitious than the Single Use Plastic Directive or any other local targets. The Single Use Plastic Directive also only defines collection for PET bottles whereas we are going beyond this, including all our primary packaging (such as glass bottles and aluminium cans). For recycled content, this is also above Single Use Plastic Directive targets for 2025. E5.MDR-T_13 We have specialised software to monitor and review for each of our ESG goals/targets, and we report monthly the actual performance and status (if we are on track, lagging behind or partly on track) to the members of the ELT who are accountable for the respective KPIs. The actuals are easily available in our EDGE dashboards. Quarterly, the performance and the related actions to achieve the annual goals are reported to the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors. E5.MDR-T_10 & E5.MDR-T_11 We have also involved our stakeholders in the process of target-setting. We use the industry best practices for setting the targets and clearly describe the calculations and methods used in our internal guidebooks. Feedback by NGOs, industry associations such as UNESDA, and suppliers, but also strategic initiatives such as the UN SDGs, are considered. Stakeholder engagement is pivotal, particularly through Annual Stakeholder Forums and frequent meetings with all relevant stakeholders (NGOs, peer companies, customers, municipalities). The insights gathered from these engagements, along with the expectations of ESG raters and investors, inform the setting of ambitious, data-driven targets. E5-3_08 We strive to minimise food loss and food waste in our operations. Our target to tackle food waste and loss across our activities and operations is: to decrease our absolute food losses (in dry matter) by 30% by 2025 compared to our 2019 baseline despite volume growth, an increase in portfolio/beverage categories, and expansion to emerging markets, and further reduce by 40% by 2030 vs 2019. Food loss and waste at our manufacturing sites are part of the overall waste management process. We strive to reach 100% recycled waste and zero waste to landfill in manufacturing. We have reduced the percentage of manufacturing waste going to landfill significantly: in 2024, only 1.6% of our manufacturing waste went to landfill, while in 2015 it was 10.1%. This means in 2024 98.4% of total manufacturing waste was recycled or used for alternative usage.. E5-4 Resource inflows E5-4_01 Resource inflows, relevant to upstream activities and reported within this chapter, take into account the results of the materiality analysis. This analysis has identified packaging inflows as a material topic. Our packaging inflows include different streams of packaging, such as: • Plastic, which is used for plastic bottles, closures, HDPE/LDPE bottles, labels and stretch/shrink films; • Glass, which is used for glass bottles; • Metal, which are used for aluminium cans and metal crowns; and • Paper, which is used for paper labels, composite aseptic carton, cardboard and wood pallets). All data relevant to our packaging inflows quantities that we used during the reporting period is disclosed in the following table.

"Sustainability Statement continued We aspire to secure correct practices towards supplier workers through the SGPs and PSA implementation. In Coca-Cola HBC, 100% of our suppliers are obliged to acknowledge and agree to the SGPs before obtaining the right to do business with us, while we apply different monitoring tools to track compliance depending on supplier category and impact to our business ranging from ESG performance tracking by means of tools such as EcoVadis IQ Plus all the way to full scale assessments such as EcoVadis Assessment, SEDEX and SGP physical audits. On agricultural level, we leverage our third-party specialists to conduct audits against the PSA principles, that are covering in an extensive manner all rules and requirements to secure farmer workers. Provision of social protection and social security Contractors who work on our premises are included in our programmes and workplace accountability audits, conducted within a three-year audit cycle. During these audits, they are assessed on human rights, and compliance with local minimum wage laws is verified by an external company. The workplace accountability audits cover various areas, including laws and regulations, wages and benefits, working hours and overtime, business Integrity, work environment, health and safety, environmental practices and demonstration of compliance. Occupational Health and Safety In the context of our implementation of Occupational Health and Safety Management System (ISO 45001), we take actions which have in scope value chain workers. We implement health and safety programmes, including Behavioural Based Safety and Life Saving Rules: • We enhanced our behaviour-based safety programme by embedding more human and operational principles across manufacturing and non-manufacturing locations. • We ensured Life Saving Rules are in place and incorporated in our cross-country verification programme. We conducted quarterly assessments of all manufacturing and non- manufacturing facilities. Based on these assessments, each country has developed its own corrective actions to address critical gaps and achieve full compliance. Value chain workers in greater risk of harm The service provided workers performing a job at our premises are part of the same rigorous hazardous analysis related to the occupational health and safety, as our employees, e.g., confined space work, work at height, electrical work, etc. Based on those analysis and based on the external occupational health and safety guidelines, we know the jobs that potentially can lead to severe OH&S incidents and thus we set up specific measures to mitigate the potential risks and avoid the incident to happen. Impact, risk and opportunity management S2-1 Policies related to value chain workers S2.MDR-P_01-06 & S2-1_06 The relevant policies adopted to manage material sustainability matters include our Occupational Health and Safety Policy and Principles for Sustainable Agriculture (PSA), as well as our Supplier Guiding Principles, which have been adopted as part of ongoing effort to develop and strengthen our relationships with our direct suppliers. These policies cover all types of value chain workers mentioned in the previous section. Occupational Health and Safety Policy Please see S1.MDR-P_01-06 & S1-1_01, 02, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 21 Supplier Guiding Principles Key contents of the policy The ‘Supplier Guiding Principles’ includes expectations regarding CCHBC’s suppliers to: • judge their employees and contractors based upon their ability to do their jobs and not upon their physical and/or personal characteristics or beliefs, affirming the principle of no discrimination based on race, colour, gender, age, religion, political opinion, national origin or sexual orientation; • provide a safe workplace with policies and practices in place to minimise the risk of accidents, injury and exposure to health risks; • compensate their employees fairly and competitively relative to their industry, in full compliance with applicable local and national wage and hour laws, and to offer opportunities for employees to develop their skills and capabilities, and to follow the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. Objective Through this policy, we seek to develop relationships with suppliers that share similar values and conduct business in an ethical manner. Process for monitoring Regarding the process for monitoring this policy, in Coca-Cola HBC 100% of our supplier are obliged to acknowledge and agree to the SGPs before obtaining the right to do business with us, while we apply different monitoring tools to track compliance depending on supplier category and impact to our business. To this purpose we use various tools, ranging from EcoVadis IQ Plus all the way to full scale assessments such SGP physical audits, SEDEX and EcoVadis Assessment. We collaborate with TCCC, which routinely utilises independent third parties to assess suppliers’ compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles. The assessments include confidential interviews with employees and on-site contract workers. Scope As part of ongoing efforts to develop and strengthen our relationships with suppliers, we have adopted these Supplier Guiding Principles for use with our direct suppliers. Most senior level accountable for the implementation of the policy Each sustainability policy is approved by the CEO and the ELT and endorsed by the Social Responsibility Committee of the Board. The Chief Supply Chain Officer and Chief Procurement Officer are accountable for the implementation of the policy. Commitment to respect third-party standards We commit through the implementation of Supplier Guiding Principles to respect applicable laws and standards with respect to their operations (e.g., ILO Standards, etc.) Consideration given to the interests of key stakeholders in setting the policy In developing the SGP, we have considered international standards such as ISO 14001, ISO 45000, the ILO and the UN Principles. We have also considered the requirements of investors and ESG raters such as S&P Global, MSCI ESG and CDP as well as the practices of peer companies who are part of UNESDA and BIER (Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable). Additionally, we have incorporated good practices recommended by NGOs such as WWF, and input from our suppliers. Policy available to potentially affected stakeholders All policies are available on our website. At business unit level, they are translated and, additionally, suppliers are mandated to sign our SGP, which is included as part of our contracts.

"94 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-1] Transition plan for climate change mitigation Commerzbank aims to actively shape the transformation towards a sustainable economy. To achieve this, we have established a comprehensive sustainability strategy, with the core objective of becoming a Net-Zero Bank. Further information on key compo- nents of this sustainability strategy can be found in ESRS E1-2 and E1-4. So far, Commerzbank has not published an explicit transition plan for climate change mitigation, as required under ESRS E1-1. We are currently developing such a climate transition plan, in which we will disclose further information about our transfor- mation path. Approval by the Bank’s Board of Managing Direc- tors and subsequent publication of the climate transition plan are earmarked for 2025. [E1-2] Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Banking operations Commerzbank AG has set itself the goal of reducing emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2040. This applies to all locations in Germany and abroad. Unavoidable CO2eq emissions are offset by certificates from CO2eq reduction projects. Renew- able energies play a central role in our energy supply. Further- more, we aim to achieve a climate-neutral supplier portfolio by 2040. Our strategies incorporate climate change mitigation, energy efficiency and other environmental criteria in accordance with the principles of the UN Global Compact. In implementing our goals, we are committed to complying with relevant standards and initiatives enacted by third parties, including in particular the Paris Agreement, the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the UN Global Compact. In addition, we are a member of the Association for Environmental Manage- ment and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (Verein für Um- weltmanagement und Nachhaltigkeit in Finanzinstituten e. V. (VfU)). With these strategies and policies, Commerzbank is respond- ing to the material impacts of its business activities. By publicly communicating our climate change mitigation targets, we can set a benchmark and have a positive influence on competitors. These overarching objectives, strategies and standards apply to all sustainability policies in relation to banking operations and are publicly available on our website. ESG framework Our ambitious sustainability targets are published and described in our ESG framework. The core components of the framework that are central to banking operations include sustainable opera- tions and stakeholder management. Responsibility for the ESG framework lies with Group Sustain- ability Management, while Group Organisation & Security over- sees implementation of sustainable operations. The ESG framework applies to Commerzbank AG as well as to selected subsidiaries. Commerzbank emphasises great importance to communica- tion with all stakeholders, encompassing our customers, inves- tors, rating agencies, analysts, non-governmental organisations, policymakers and the general public. We keep in contact with our major stakeholders through personal dialogue, discussion events, strategic partnerships and various public communication chan- nels. Progress is monitored by means of an annual process for col- lecting, analysing and reporting relevant operational-environ- mental sustainability indicators. Commerzbank environmental guidelines Our comprehensive environmental guidelines outline the princi- ples of environmentally friendly business activities. These guide- lines are based on international standards and take into account all relevant aspects along our entire value chain, including the core elements of corporate responsibility, climate change mitiga- tion and climate change adaptation, resource-conserving energy use, prevention of environmental damage, promotion of biodiver- sity, transition to a circular economy, climate-neutral supplier portfolio, mobility of our employees and ongoing improvements to our environmental performance. The environmental guidelines adopted by the Board of Managing Directors serve as operating procedures for all employees of the Commerzbank Group. The Group Organisation & Security division is responsible for imple- mentation. Our environmental and energy management system"

This underlines our commitment to continuously improve our environmental perfor- mance and energy efficiency. Regular reports to the Board of Di- rectors ensure the effectiveness of our management systems. Standard for sustainable procurement With its standard for sustainable procurement, Commerzbank has laid down binding guidelines governing sustainability mat- ters when purchasing goods and services. The environmental, so- cial and governance criteria specified in the standard reflect Commerzbank’s corporate responsibility demands of its service providers and suppliers. Therefore, Commerzbank also actively influences the sustainable orientation of suppliers and service providers through purchasing decisions. The regulations defined by Corporate Procurement are binding for all units of Commerzbank AG both in Germany and abroad. The target group includes all process participants involved in procurement. The standard serves as a framework for subsidiar- ies in Germany and abroad when making internal decisions based on company-specific requirements. The standard for sustainable procurement promotes sustain- able development in the procurement process. The defined crite- ria and rules of conduct are intended to make the consideration of sustainability aspects practicable for all process partici- pants. In addition, the standard aims to raise awareness among Commerzbank employees on the topic of sustainability. Within the context of the internal control system, controls have been defined for evaluating suppliers prior to entering into new contractual relationships as well as for managing existing suppli- ers. These also include ESG criteria as a part of an overall scoring model. When selecting suppliers, Commerzbank’s Reputational Risk Management analyses the suppliers on a case-by-case basis. The commissioning organisational units and Corporate Procure- ment evaluate service providers to ensure compliance with the requirements outlined in the standard. We notify suppliers of any necessary improvements in terms of sustainability performance and document the results of the assessments. Banking business Commerzbank AG’s climate change mitigation targets in the cus- tomer business and the steps required to achieve these objectives are explicitly governed by the ESG framework and the associated internal “ESG Framework Policy”. In this policy and the underly- ing procedures, Commerzbank AG sets out the building blocks of its sustainability strategy and describes how the three sustaina- bility KPIs are managed:  Net zero carbon emissions in the loan and investment portfo- lio by 2050  Mobilising €300bn in sustainable products by 2025  Net zero carbon emissions in banking operations by 2040 One concrete goal is therefore to create transparency in our sustainability activities, including a clear definition of what ESG means in our customer business. The framework also presents our sustainable product solutions and consolidates the sustaina- bility guidelines and exclusion criteria. Commerzbank published a revised framework in February 2025, which has been updated to include an expanded and optimised set of sustainability targets and has undergone a fundamental redesign in terms of structure. Climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation are addressed in the ESG framework and in the corresponding policy, primarily through the net zero target, SBTi management, binding exclusion criteria and minimum standards, consideration of cli- mate matters in risk management, as well as by financing sus- tainable projects and offering sustainable products. The topic of renewable energies is addressed through financing for projects in this area, for example through the Centre of Competence Green Infrastructure Finance. The main objective of the framework and internal policy is to create a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent management of the relevant products, processes and activities, paving the way for the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank AG. The ESG framework therefore describes both Commerzbank’s impacts on the environment (“Save the World” perspective) and the environ- ment’s impacts on Commerzbank AG (“Save the Bank” perspec- tive), encompassing both the risk and impact perspectives of the associated business activities. Significant opportunities arise in the sustainability context from sustainable product solutions (fi- nancing and investments), which are covered by the €300bn tar- get. Commerzbank AG’s sustainability efforts as described in the framework are operationalised and monitored using the three sustainability KPIs. The Group Sustainability Board, a Bank-wide committee focusing on sustainability issues that is attended by members of the Board of Managing Directors, is responsible for the ESG framework. The head of Group Strategy, Transformation & Sustainability division and the steering committee of the stra- tegic initiative “Sustainability 360°” are responsible for the inter- nal policy."

"To our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 29 27 Declaration on corporate governance pursuant to Sec. 289f and Sec. 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 39 Details pursuant to Sec. 289 and Sec. 315 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) The composition of the Board of Managing Directors and the responsibilities of its individual members are presented on page 5 of this Annual Report. The work of the Board of Managing Directors is specified in greater detail in its rules of procedure, which may be viewed on Commerzbank AG’s website. The remuneration of the members of the Board of Managing Directors is presented in detail in the remuneration report, which is published on Commerzbank AG’s website. Supervisory Board Commerzbank AG’s Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Board of Managing Directors in its management of the Bank and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance. The Supervisory Board discharges its responsibilities in accordance with legal requirements, the Articles of Association and its rules of procedure. It cooperates closely and on a basis of trust with the Board of Managing Directors in the interests of the Bank. Taking into account the recommendations of the Presiding and Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board decides on the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Managing Directors and, together with the Board of Managing Directors, ensures long-term succession planning. If necessary, external consultants are brought in. The composition of the Supervisory Board and the members of its committees are presented on pages 19 to 21 of this Annual Report, in accordance with recommendation D.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Details of the work of this body, its structure and its control function can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board on pages 6 to 18. Further details on how the Supervisory Board and its committees work can be found in the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, available on Commerzbank AG’s website. The duties of the individual permanent committees are set out in the respective rules of procedure, which can also be viewed on Commerzbank AG’s website. According to recommendation C.1 of the Code, the Supervisory Board should set concrete objectives and draw up a profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. In doing so, it should give consideration to diversity. The Supervisory Board’s skills and expertise profile shall also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues relevant to the Bank. Appointments proposed by the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting should take these objectives into account while also seeking to fulfil the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. The status of implementation is to be disclosed in the form of a qualification matrix in the declaration on corporate governance. In addition, in accordance with recommendation C.2 of the Code, an age limit for members of the Supervisory Board should be specified and disclosed in the declaration on corporate governance. The length of Supervisory Board membership is also to be disclosed in accordance with recommendation C.3 of the Code. Commerzbank AG’s Supervisory Board has approved the following concrete objectives: The composition of the Supervisory Board should be such that, overall, its members have the necessary skills, expertise, experience and knowledge to be able to perform its duties properly. In particular, the Supervisory Board should have all the expertise and experience deemed essential for the activities of the Commerzbank Group. In addition, the legal requirements with regard to special expertise and professional experience of individual members of the Supervisory Board in specific areas must be met (for example, expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing, including sustainability reporting and auditing thereof, as well as in the areas of risk management and risk controlling), and at least one member of the Supervisory Board should have special expertise in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. The members of the Supervisory Board must be able to challenge and monitor the decisions made by the Board of Managing Directors. The members of the Supervisory Board should also be able to devote sufficient time to the performance of their duties. Members should be reliable, and consideration should be given to their commitment, personality, professionalism, integrity and independence. The target is that the Supervisory Board should always have at least eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting who are independent as defined in recommendation C.6 of the Code, and not more than two former members of Commerzbank AG’s Board of Managing Directors. The length of service of the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting should generally not exceed a period of 12 years. The term of office of a member of the Supervisory Board should generally end at the end of the Annual General Meeting following the member’s 72nd birthday. The Supervisory Board has resolved a detailed profile of skills and expertise for its composition, which may be consulted on Commerzbank AG’s website. As can be seen from the following qualification matrix based on a self-assessment by members of the Supervisory Board, all objectives set by the Supervisory Board with regard to its composition, as well as its profile of skills and expertise, had been implemented as of 31 December 2024:"

"110 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-7] GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits GHG removal and storage Climate change mitigation is an important aspect of our corporate responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecolog- ical footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality car- bon credits. In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforesta- tion. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant” (wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project” (biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised qual- ity standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide so- called Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon off- setting for banking operations. Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally ver- ified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 re- porting year we offset both current emissions and parts of emissions from 2023. Offsetting strategy All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable car- bon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclu- sively through projects with generally recognised quality standards such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Prin- ciples (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market. The focus of the projects we select is on countries in the global South, as these are often the ones most affected by the conse- quences of climate change. We do not remove or store any greenhouse gases in our own operations or in the upstream and downstream value chain.

We have developed a wide range of activities, measures and objectives for this purpose, which we describe in de- tail in ESRS E4-2 to E4-6. At the present time, however, Com- merzbank does not have a comprehensive transition plan on this topic, since this was identified as immaterial for us during the ma- teriality assessment. In addition, the methodological basis and data availability needed to draw up such a transition plan currently fall short of requirements. Commerzbank is actively working to solve these challenges. Further information can be found in ESRS E4-2 to E4-6. Biodiversity risks, like climate risks, are regularly included in the business and sustainability strategy. As part of its annual strategy process, Commerzbank analyses various key indicators and envi- ronmental factors that are relevant to the Bank’s strategy and busi- ness model. This analysis includes both internal perspectives (including employees) and external perspectives (including custom- ers and investors). The results and conclusions from the holistic analysis are used in the downstream strategy process to develop the strategy and business model. Commerzbank also conducts an annual assessment of the mate- riality of biodiversity risks, including their impact on business risks. The results of this analysis are used to help develop the business strategy, the business risk strategy and the various sub-risk strate- gies. For further information on how we incorporate biodiversity into our strategy and business model, please see ESRS E4 SBM-3. [E4-2] Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems Almost all global economic activities depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services. A look at the current state of biodiversity makes it clear that the time for action is now. Dependency and impacts on biodiversity can lead to physical and transition risks – but they can also create opportunities. For this rea- son, the topic of biodiversity is also of strategic importance for Com- merzbank AG. Concepts in Commerzbank’s banking business Commerzbank AG has already adopted specific positions and exclu- sion criteria geared to protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. Im- portant aspects include land use change, pollution and the use of water and marine resources. A major problem concerning land use change is deforestation. To minimise deforestation risks in Commerzbank AG’s portfolio, we have formulated our own position on the topic of deforestation. For more information on this strategy, see ESRS E4-3 and E4-4. Furthermore, in its position on mining, Commerzbank AG ex- cludes the financing of mining projects that use mountain top re- moval (MTR) due to the damage this does to the surrounding area, as well as the financing of companies that mine coal using this method. This mining technique is extremely harmful to the environ- ment and results in significant land use changes. Ecological factors as well as reports of adverse impacts on high conservation value areas and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, for ex- ample in the energy and fossil fuel sectors, are also included in a case-by-case assessment. Taking these factors into account should help to preserve important ecological and cultural regions and mit- igate changes in these areas."

"BRUNEL INTERNATIONAL N.V. ANNUAL REPORT 2024 42 REPORT FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BRUNEL INTERNATIONAL N.V. ANNUAL REPORT 2024 43 REPORT FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CapEx The applied denominator is equal to all additions to tangible and intangible assets considered before depreciation, amortisation and any re-measurements, including those resulting from revaluations and impairments, for the relevant financial year and excluding fair value changes. The denominator also covered additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations. The numerator is determined by including the portion of CapEx associated with eligible or aligned activities. Therefore the numerator was calculated using the costs associated with activity 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings. OpEx The applied denominator is equal to all direct non- capitalised costs that relate to research and development, building renovation measures, short- term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and equipment by the undertaking or third party to whom activities are outsourced that are necessary to ensure the continued and effective functioning of such assets. The numerator is determined by including the portion of OpEx associated with eligible or aligned activities. Therefore the numerator was calculated using the costs associated with activities, 6.4 - Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics under climate change mitigation and, 6.5 - Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles under climate change mitigation. F. ASSESSMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION (EU)2020/852 Brunel has adhered to the highest standards of integrity and has accurately followed the defined scope and definitions as outlined by the most recent available information provided by the European Commission or associated working groups such as the Platform of Sustainable Finance (Technical Expert Group (TEG)). We have not included any eligible activities or associated information that was deemed out of the scope of these definitions. In instances where the inclusion of information was uncertain, a decision was taken to exclude this information to allow for further analysis. In this regard, we commit to correcting or omitting any inaccuracies in the subsequent reporting year based on new insights or clarifications provided by the European Commission. The EU Taxonomy is a dynamic piece of legislation, expected to undergo further updates in the coming years. These updates may include additional economic activities, technical screening criteria, and/or environmental or social objectives. We will continue to review all new communications or publications issued by the European Commission or associated working groups related to the EU Taxonomy at such times, to determine any potential reporting implications and to ensure accuracy and transparency going forward. B. ELIGIBILITY AND ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS Following our 2023 EU Taxonomy assessment, a revised eligibility analysis was conducted on our revenue generating activities, which falls under Human Resourcing services, referenced under NACE Code N78 (Employment activities) for reporting period 2024 against all six environmental objectives. Furthermore, the EU Taxonomy Navigator, made available by the European Commission, was screened and reviewed to determine potential eligibility. It has therefore been determined that Brunel currently does not engage in any turnover generating activities that fall within the scope of the EU Taxonomy. We understand that the EU Taxonomy and the Climate Delegated Act as well as the Environmental Delegated Act including its Annexes requires non-financial undertakings with non-Taxonomy eligible economic activities to report on the part of the CapEx and OpEx related to the purchase of output from Taxonomy- aligned economic activities and individual measures enabling target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions. In this regard we reviewed so-called cross-cutting activities that are not directly related to our primary business activities and are not revenue-generating but still are of relevance and in scope of CapEx and OpEx calculation methodology as per the EU taxonomy regulations. Through the assessment, the following activities were assessed to be eligible: Activity EU Taxonomy Activity Associated EU taxonomy objective Lease Cars 6.5 - Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles under climate change mitigation Climate change mitigation Employee bicycle schemes 6.4. Operation of personal mobility devices, cycle logistics under climate change mitigation Climate change mitigation Renovation of building 7.2. - Renovation of existing building Climate change mitigation C. ALIGNMENT ANALYSIS Although the activities mentioned above have been identified as eligible, further analysis was performed using the technical screening criteria to assess their alignment with the EU Taxonomy. It was determined that we do not have the necessary or sufficient data to evaluate alignment with the respective technical screening criteria for our eligible activities. D. QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES Subsequent to the above eligibility analysis, the proportion of our current turnover that can be considered as eligible and/or aligned is 0%. Through assessment of potential CapEx and OpEx associated costs under the EU Taxonomy, we concluded that we have 10% eligible CapEx, 8.9% eligible OpEx and 0% aligned CapEx and OpEx costs. (2023: CAPEX 18%, OpEx 0.02%, Turnover 0%). For presenting our Taxonomy KPIs for Turnover, CapEx and OpEx we use the templates provided in Annex II to the Disclosures Delegated Act. E. QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES Turnover The applied denominator, defined as per Article 2, point (5), of Directive 2013/34/EU, is defined as total revenue as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. The numerator (proportion of eligible and aligned turnover ) is determined as the part of the net turnover derived from products or services, including intangibles, associated with Taxonomy-eligible economic activities.

"Policies, actions and performance With our sector transition plan we focus on the most carbon-intensive sectors and steering them towards net zero, as described in the previous section. As a bank, we have more measures in place to manage our impacts, risks and opportunities. These actions are not part of our sector transition plan, but do present our strategic direction and are an integral part of how we do and manage our business. This next section includes the relevant policies and guidelines to address the material impacts, risks and opportunities and the related actions to execute those policies and guidelines. Where the Environmental, Social and Governance Risk Policy addresses our negative impacts and risks, our sustainable finance guidelines and green bond framework address our opportunities. The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Risk Policy The ESG Risk Framework, as further described in the 'ESG risk’ section, outlines ING’s approach to managing ESG risk as a risk driver of existing risk types. The framework is supported by the double materiality assessment (DMA1) and the ESG Risk Policy, ensuring the implementation of obligations, processes and control requirements from the policy. The ESG Risk Policy outlines ING’s approach to effectively identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report ESG related risks as per ING’s ESG risk appetite, by considering applicable and material risks and negative impacts across the value chain as per ING’s DMA. The policy is applicable to ING Groep N.V. and all majority-owned and/or controlled ING entities, unless deviation is allowed by pursuant to local laws, regulations and/or supervisory acts. Relevant legislation and supervisory guidance on risk management practices, as well as ESG-related disclosures including the EBA Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Pillar 3 disclosures on ESG risk, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) are taken into account when drafting the policy. The ESG Risk Policy outlines its objectives and purpose, referencing relevant laws, regulations and global documentation. It also details the high-level obligations for entities, including control objectives to manage and mitigate ESG risks. The obligations are provided for applicable value-chain components. The ESG Risk Department, as the policy owner, performs oversight and monitoring of the policy implementation to obtain sufficient comfort of compliance with policy obligations across ING. ESG risks are an overarching set of risk drivers affecting financial, non-financial, and other overarching risks. Consequently, ESG risk management is embedded within existing risk processes and procedures related to credit granting criteria, risk appetite steering, and credit risk management. ING local entities integrate global requirements into local policy annexes, taking into account specifics of local regulations and market practices. Mostly such adjustments are done through lending criteria, local systems of loan management, systems of records and sales force procedures. Actions to implement the ESG Risk Policy As part of the risk management cycle (see the ‘ESG risk section’), ING takes a proactive approach to mitigating identified risks in line with its risk appetite. This is achieved through various risk mitigation strategies, such as reducing, avoiding, accepting, or transferring the risk. These measures are embedded in updates to existing policies and procedures across different risk categories. In the following paragraphs we elaborate on the key initiatives for each of the business lines where climate change has been identified as a material risk. Retail Banking: Residential mortgages ING regularly analyses different transmission channels and takes actions to manage associated risks. Transition and physical risks for the mortgage portfolio have been incorporated into ING’s business strategy, data controls, risk appetite, lending criteria and collateral valuation processes for local retail entities. Each local entity implements the ESG Risk Policy via the global guidance on material identified topics. Local adaptations are made in line with local regulations and market practices (reference: Organisational bodies, ‘ESG risk’ section). • Some local entities have already implemented policies to increase financing amounts and reduce pricing for properties with high-quality EPCs. Additionally, customer-engagement procedures, supported by advisory services and duty of care, aim at shifting customer interest towards low-emitting buildings. • One of the most crucial actions ING took to achieve more accurate emissions-based target setting and to better understand the effectiveness of its business strategy was implementing a set of mandatory data controls. For new originations, ING local entities implemented controls to ensure the mandatory collection of EPC data. Additionally, for the existing portfolio, controls on the development of energy performance proxy models facilitated high-quality data remediation. • Risk appetite is aligned with the business strategy and includes specific metrics for managing low-quality EPCs at new origination. Breaches in risk appetite are managed within the Risk Appetite Framework, with timely escalation to the ESG Risk Committee and top management. • The incorporation of climate-related risks into lending criteria is aligned with our risk appetite and business strategy. • Transition and physical risks are incorporated into collateral valuation through external valuers or by internally managing collateral haircuts and loan-to-value limitations for high-emitting properties.

Important ESG factors are determined on a case by case basis and considers international standards such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on responsible business conduct and the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights"
"Biodiversity and ecosystems Biodiversity is the variety of and interaction between all living things (red. species) which work together in ecosystems to maintain, balance and support life. It supports in nature all we need to survive, but since we put increasing pressure on the earth by using and consuming more natural resources, we are upsetting the balance of ecosystems, leading to the loss of biodiversity. Identified impacts, risks and opportunities Our double materiality assessment concluded the below negative impact and risk for ‘state of species’ within biodiversity and ecosystems as material for our Wholesale Banking portfolio: • Negative impact on the state of species occurs due to lending to clients whose operations cause irreversible damage, such as some species disappearing entirely and others undergoing significant changes in behaviour, genetic variability, distribution, and population dynamics. • Risks can materialise following the severity of a negative impact and varies across sectors. This can result in a demise in natural resources, and can disrupt clients’ operations, leading to financial losses. Financial losses can also occur due to reputational damage and litigation risks. This section only focuses on the ‘state of species’ as per our DMA outcome. The identified negative impact for state of species is driven by our portfolio composition in the downstream value chain and the irremediable nature of the negative effects. By financing these downstream activities, we contribute to a cumulative impact on species that goes beyond the initial stages of resource extraction, land use changes, overexploitation of natural resources, increased emissions, and waste (i.e. the drivers of biodiversity loss). The cumulative impact refers to the ongoing and interconnected effects that unfold over time, leading to a significant and often irreversible decline in biodiversity and ecosystem health. Some impacts, such as species extinction, are permanent. Once a species is lost, it cannot be brought back, leading to a permanent reduction in biodiversity. In addition, a significant loss in genetic variability or niche habitat also makes it immensely difficult to bring back a species to a safe state without the risk of extinction. The impact on the state of species by different activities has very different time horizons from short- to long-term. A sudden decline in species can, for example, be caused by a spill of dangerous substances, immediately killing surrounding life. Habitat fragmentation leads to a medium-term decline of the number of species and genetic variability within a species. Climate change can lead to the extinction of species and disrupt ecosystems over decades. See the ‘Technical notes to the double materiality assessment’ for more details on the approach. There is currently still a lack of well-established and scenario-based quantification methods when it comes to the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems, and nature more broadly. However, this field is rapidly developing and is looking at both transition risks, such as nature-related policy and technology changes, as well as physical risks caused by ecosystem losses and climate–nature interactions in order to integrate them into stress testing and modelling. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of global GDP depends on biodiversity, which includes the state of species. As our portfolio reflects the real economy, we expect it to have a similar dependency.1 Assessment of current financial effects is based on ING’s internal risk database. We rely on the existing approach based on the recognition and measurement criteria of provisions in the Financial Statements, for more information see Note 15 'Provisions' and Note 41 'Legal proceedings'. For 2024, there were no significant current financial effects. At this stage, we are not able to provide a more quantitative or qualitative resilience analysis or more specific time horizons. As our business is diverse and distributed across the globe, we do not consider the opinion of location-based stakeholders into our general resilience analysis; these are considered on a transaction level. Before financing specific large-scale projects, we do consider the resilience of our clients’ businesses to local biodiversity-related transition and physical risks, including those with impacts on the local population. In environmental and social management assessments, local stakeholders give key inputs into the outcome of the analysis according to the Equator Principles. For the mid- and long-term horizons, we depend on customer engagement and the ability of our borrowers to understand possible implications of biodiversity loss on their business. ING is currently developing such expertise and so are our borrowers. We are also expecting increasing regulatory pressure from the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as EU-led initiatives to reduce pollution, production and use of plastics and water, and increased concern about species and protected habitats. Our nature strategy The overarching ambition of our nature strategy2 is to empower our clients to contribute to halting and reversing nature loss and support the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Our nature approach, available on ing.com, addresses all the main drivers of nature loss that are inextricably linked to the state of species3. While these drivers are not material for our portfolio, they are relevant for the assessment of all transactions. We are currently developing a transition plan that should become operational in the coming years, building on the structure and experience of our Terra approach for climate, enabling us to engage our clients on relevant environmental topics.

"whole, this is relevant for our material sub-topic, state of species. The below visual illustrates our current strategic approach towards nature. Policies, actions and performance As a financial institution, we can make the largest impact through our financing activities. Therefore, we have policies and guidelines in place to manage nature-related risks and impacts. ESG Risk Policy ING’s strategic objectives of managing nature-related risks and impacts are being implemented by the ESG Risk Policy. The ESG Risk Policy is a comprehensive environmental and social risk policy that evaluates material environmental risk factors in relation to our financing. This entails the evaluation of the direct drivers of biodiversity loss, climate change, land-use, sea-use or freshwater use change, pollution and the exploitation of natural resources, as well as the extent to which the company’s operations and products/ services likely impact the state of species and habitats, and the extent and condition of ecosystems, given its sector. It further assesses the extent to which the company is likely dependent on ecosystem services for its operations, products and services, given its sector. The ESG Risk Policy addresses our negative impact on the state of species, our dependencies on species and ecosystems, and our risk related to that. Our risk is lower if we finance fewer transactions that are harmful to the state of species, or support our clients in reducing their impact by implementing minimum requirements and encouraging them to improve. The ESG Risk Policy contains several biodiversity and ecosystem-specific requirements for our financing activities with the aim of avoiding further habitat destruction and species loss. These include, but are not limited to: • We will not finance any operations located in, or that significantly impact, based on experts’ assessments, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, wetlands registered by the Ramsar Convention, or critical natural habitats registered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category I and II. • We will not finance operations or any newly developed asset that involves illegal logging, deforestation or burning down of tropical forests, or removal of primary or High Conservation (HCV) forests. • We conduct enhanced due diligence before financing projects requiring significant land-use change, and for operations impacting IUCN Category III and IV sites or potentially vulnerable ecosystems including ‘Key Biodiversity Areas’. These are home to critical populations of the world’s threatened species. Furthermore, we have sector-specific minimum standards that aim at minimising impacts within the industry. They especially target the industry sectors chemicals, bioenergy, forestry & agricultural commodities, manufacturing, metals & mining, and shipping. Examples of restrictions to the most harmful practices within sectors with a high risk of impacting the state of species are: • ING has no intention of expanding its palm oil client base. For existing clients, ING performs strict assessment criteria that are closely monitored; • ING will not directly finance artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) companies or activities; • Use of endangered species or non-human primates for all testing/experimental purposes; and • Arctic offshore oil & gas exploration and production. Specific requirements under the ESG Risk Policy support the traceability of products, components and raw materials. For example, ING requires all relevant clients to adopt the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) schemes or the programme for the endorsement of forest certification schemes. This includes wood plantations, traders, pulp producers, and secondary processors. ING also requires production, sourcing and consumption from ecosystems to limit the impact on species. For example, we expect that our clients producing biofuels or involved in the value chain to understand and assess the climate-related, environmental and social risks related to their biofuels business, and manage and mitigate these risks Contents ING at a glance Strategy, business model and value creation Our financial performance Our leadership and corporate governance Sustainability Statement Capital management Risk management Consolidated financial statements Parent company financial statements Other information and appendices > Environment ING Group Annual Report 2024 131"

"2.2 Emissions reduction and climate change for more information). Actions taken in 2024 include switching the electricity supply of the London office to fully renewable sources and further office management actions. Carbon neutrality in 2024 was also achieved through offsetting its remaining emissions at its own operations level through a Ugandan reforestation project. The project consists of a long-term community-led agroforestry program with the aim to increase carbon sequestration, encourage sustainable land use practices, and provide performance based payments to farmers. The project is of key relevance as it aligns with Exor's passions for education and diversity & inclusion, and it focuses on educating and improving farmers' knowledge as well as on community involvement (particularly women) in land use planning. Exor encourages its investee companies to set reduction targets for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and measure Scope 3 emissions. Education: Exor commits to reducing the gender gap in STEM subjects via the Matabì initiative - Exor's flagship educational programme carried out in collaboration with Fondazione Agnelli. Please refer to the section on Matabì on page 126-127 for more information. Exor encourages its investee companies to pursue company-relevant educational initiatives accompanied by clear metrics and targets. Diversity and Inclusion: Exor commits to maintaining 40/60 gender balance and considering diverse candidates for all new appointments. Exor encourages its investee companies to set diversity targets and measure and report progress against them.

"2.2 Emissions reduction and climate change. Risks and opportunities were identified starting from impacts and dependencies on resources and relationships, and in line with Exor's risk assessment and prior year TCFD reports. When assessing impact materiality, Exor addressed actual and potential negative impacts based on an average scoring of their scale, scope and irremediable character multiplied by likelihood. In the specific case of potential negative impacts on human rights, the scale was weighted as a more important factor than likelihood. For positive impacts, Exor used an average scoring of their scale and scope multiplied by likelihood. When assessing financial materiality, Exor addressed likelihood, magnitude (including the nature of the financial effects of the identified risks and opportunities), in line with the methodology and assessment used in Exor’s risk assessment and prior year TCFD reports. In performing the overall risk assessment sustainability-related risks were evaluated in the same manner as other risks to which Exor is exposed without giving a higher level of priority.

"2.2 Emissions reduction and climate change Relevant sub-topics Impacts, risks and opportunities Climate change adaptation Risk in own operations: investment entities whose investments are in high-emissions sectors can potentially risk poorer investment returns as markets and regulations transition to a greener economic model. Other potential factors that could lead to weaker investment returns include technological shifts, fluctuations in supply and demand and policy changes. (Short-Medium-Long Term) Risk in the value chain: business interruptions, loss in revenues, reduced product availability and an increase in repair costs or damaged buildings at an investee level caused by extreme weather events (hurricane, floods) as well as longer shifts in climate patterns potentially leading to droughts, heat waves and water stress. (Short-Medium term) Climate change mitigation Negative actual impact in the value chain: GHG emissions generated by the motor vehicle sector contributing to climate change (including resource extraction and production of materials, transport, industrial processes, GHG emissions from the vehicles sold and the vehicles' end of life). (Short-Medium-Long term) Positive actual impact in the value chain: reduction of CO2 emissions through the sale of alternative products and services and low-carbon vehicles (batteries, alternative fuels, etc.). (Short-Medium-Long term) Risk in the value chain: reputational damage and loss of financial support due to failure to meet stakeholders' increasing expectations related to climate commitments and transparency of investee companies, also caused by delays in securing carbon removal technologies and new technology for electrification. (Medium-Long term) Opportunity in the value chain: the increasing customer demand and regulatory requirements for energy-efficient vehicles and equipment with a lower environmental impact may lead to expanded market share and revenue growth for investee companies. (Short-Medium-Long term) The DMA identified climate change as the most material topic and as sub-topics climate change mitigation for the downstream value chain (investee companies) and climate change adaptation for both its own operations and the value chain. Given its nature, Exor has carried out a resilience assessment of its strategy and business model in relation to climate change for its downstream value chain activities through its investee companies, who operate across diverse sectors and play a key role in the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. This exposes Exor to sector-specific risks and opportunities, which it addresses by analysing climate scenarios aligned with a 2°C or lower pathway. These analyses help Exor assess its strategy’s resilience and are considered as part of overall capital allocation decisions. In 2023, Exor identified its climate-related risks and opportunities in line with TCFD recommendations, based on its composition and has quantitatively assessed those that are most relevant. The investee companies in scope were Ferrari, Stellantis, CNH Industrial and Iveco Group, as they account for approximately 99% of the CO2 emissions deriving from the investee companies and considering the nature of their business, they are likely to have a high level of exposure to both transition and physical climate change risks and opportunities in the short, medium and long term. Climate-related scenario analysis Scenario analysis Exor's resilience strategy has been assessed at the investee company level by considering different climate scenarios defined by internationally accredited providers (IEA, IPCC - SSP/RCP), which use advanced statistical modelling in order to give representation of climate state and climate-related policy evolution. 108 BOARD REPORT"

At the same time, these companies are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change like extreme weather events and hazards. Examples of initiatives carried out by the investee companies can be found below: • Ferrari: Ferrari's Environmental Practice highlights its commitment to minimising its environmental impact. The company focuses on cutting greenhouse gas emissions throughout product life cycles, minimising water use, reusing waste materials, monitoring emissions, and protecting biodiversity in affected areas. Ferrari's decarbonization strategy defined in 2022 is aligned with the trajectory “well below 2°C” in order to contribute to ambitions at the international, national and regional level and entails a reduction of at least 90% of Scope 1 and 2 (market-based method) absolute CO2eq emissions and a reduction of at least 40% of Scope 3 emissions per car, with respect to 2021. In this context, Ferrari's most significant environmental efforts are deployed through a program for the reduction of polluting and GHG emissions, both direct and indirect. • Stellantis: Stellantis has undertaken key actions to address climate change by preventing, mitigating, and remediating its impacts, while also managing climate-related risks and opportunities. These initiatives align with the company's policy objectives and GHG emission reduction targets, as outlined in its Dare Forward strategic plan (reducing absolute GHG emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3 compared to the 2021 base year, lowering GHG emissions intensity per vehicle across these scopes, and reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions).

"Climate change adaptation and energy-related opportunities Climate change has been part of Elisa’s strategy, since 2009. Our experience enables us to help our customers in creation of a more sustainable future through digitalisation. We see opportunities in tackling climate challenges by developing new business innovations in sustainability. For instance, our International Digital Services is built on our expertise in automation and digitalisation. Elisa offers an IoT platform with advanced machine learning and predictive analysis capabilities. This technology can be used also to better manage energy efficiency and other relevant parameters of buildings. Furthermore, Elisa’s AI-driven software helps ramp up production quickly and sustainably by identifying issues and optimising energy use. Our Distributed Energy Solution (DES) transforms radio access networks into virtual power plants, using AI to efficiently manage energy by controlling the charging and discharging of batteries. DES also has the capability of providing grid-balancing services to transmission system operators (TSOs). This helps in addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy sources. In Finland, Elisa utilises DES to participate in the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve, providing grid-balancing services to Fingrid, the national TSO. Transition plan for climate change mitigation Elisa has committed to the Paris Agreement to keep global warming to 1.5°C. In 2023, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for Elisa’s updated near-term science-based target, and we are the first listed company in Finland to set a long-term net-zero target. On our ambitious journey towards Net-zero in 2040, we are currently focusing on Elisa’s 2030 near-term climate target of a 42 percent absolute reduction in GHG emissions in all our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions compared to the base year of 2021. We publicly share a high-level overview of Elisa’s climate transition planning on our website. Elisa’s climate targets are reviewed by Elisa’s BOD and approved by CEB. These targets have been communicated to internal and external stakeholders. The Elisa Climate Transition Plan (CTP) is a roadmap towards low carbon business in Elisa’s own operations as well as its chain of activities. Through CTP and more concrete Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), we drive our ambitious near-term and long- term climate targets. This takes a long-term commitment of continuous improvement in carbon emission reduction and creates the foundation for climate actions over the three-year strategy period for 2025–2027. The CTP is integrated to Elisa’s environmental management system (EMS) and energy management system (EnMS). Scope 1 and 2 emissions are responsible for about 1percent of Elisa’s total carbon emissions, resulting Scope 3 emission to be 99 percent and thus having the material impact. From Scope 3 emissions, our own operations (waste generated, business travel and employee commuting) result in only 2 percent while the remaining are from Elisa’s value chain. Therefore, supply chain engagement and collaboration are crucial to drive our climate targets and keep within planetary boundaries. In 2024, Elisa launched its responsible supplier financing, which is a working capital financing solution offered by Elisa together with its finance partner. Material efficiency is enabled mainly through circular economy solutions. To reduce the amount of waste in our operations, we repair, refurbish and reuse when feasible, and we responsibly recycle equipment at the end of its lifespan. We also offer device repair and refurbishment services to our customers, as well as specific circular economy business models, like devices-as-a-service. Energy efficiency has been part of our operational development and monitored on a strategic level since 2009. By the end of 2024, we had improved our energy efficiency in mobile data transfers by 71percent since 2016. Similarly, Elisa’s carbon footprint from Scope 1 and 2 emissions had decreased by more than 80 percent compared to 2016. In some cases, we have been able to productise innovations that we have created to address energy efficiency in our own operations, making them part of the sustainable solutions we offer to customers. Energy efficiency initiatives throughout Elisa’s operations receive substantial continuous investments i.e. through modernisation. Also, Elisa’s first circular economy initiatives, in the form of building repair and refurbishment capabilities, have received significant investments. The latter is also reported according to EU Taxonomy regulations. Elisa does not have a high-emissions infrastructure as we use only carbon-free electricity for our telecom networks and data centres. Elisa thus has very few assets with locked-in GHG emissions other than backup power generators, which use fossil fuels but are difficult to phase out due to regulatory resilience requirements. In Elisa’s annual strategy process, the results of the double materiality assessment are utilised to identify the environme­ ntal issues important to the business. The strategic sustaina­ bility targets are part of Elisa’s high-level strategic action plan (Key Means), each owned by a designated member of CEB. These members, along with the appointed strategy leads, are responsible for ensuring that the necessary actions, goals, and resources are in place to achieve the targets within the agreed timelines. This approach ensures ownership, delegation, sufficient resources for implementation, and regular monitoring of the strategic action plan’s execution that support the target. The strategy owners and leads are responsible for reporting on performance to the relevant Elisa stakeholders. In Elisa’s annual strategy process, the environ­ mental issues important to the business are reviewed. CRMB approves EMS as well as monitors and guides the CTAP. Elisa’s relevant businesses are responsible for setting adequate actions according to CTAP. EMS development and CTAP follow up is maintained by domain experts in the Elisa Environment and Energy Working Group (EEWG). The EEWG tracks progress in implementing the CTAP, as part of the regular management of both the EMS and EnMS. The CRMB reviews the performance regularly. 63 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E1 Climate change Policies Elisa has set Group-level policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Elisa Code of Conduct sets the foundation for our ethical business behaviour. Elisa’s Environmental Policy describes our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our business in our own operations and chain of activities. Similarly, Elisa’s Energy Policy describes our goal to sustainably improving energy performance. Additionally, Elisa Code of Ethical Purchasing describes the ethical and legal duties and responsibilities of our suppliers. Elisa complies with all applicable environmental and climate legislation and regulations and requires all the stakeholders in its operations and chain of activities to similarly comply with them. Elisa’s Environmental and Energy Policy adhere to the principles and reporting guidelines of the CSRD, the UN Global Compact, and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These policies are approved by Elisa’s Corporate Responsibility Management Board (CRMB). These policies are publicly available and accessible applying to every employee in Elisa and all third parties acting on behalf of Elisa. We require our suppliers, subcontractors, and external partners to comply with these or similar principles. The policies provide clear guidance on responsible practices and outlines commitments and strategies for achieving envi­ ronmental sustainability and addressing climate change within Elisa’s global operations. It addresses Elisa’s commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy and resource efficiency, and circularity. Through sustainable actions and the development of innovative solutions, Elisa aims to significantly reduce both its own carbon footprint and those of its customers. Our approach As a part of double materiality assessment (DMA), Elisa has evaluated impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. The material negative impacts lie both in our upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Elisa’s previous climate scenarios work was utilised as part of our DMA, and it is addressed while creating financial statements. Through this work, Elisa has identified physical and transitional climate risks, which pose impacts for Elisa’s operations over different time horizons. Climate change resilience analysis has been conducted for the whole Elisa group of companies and key supplier categories. In the analysis, we assess which of Elisa’s locations of operation have physical climate change vulnerabilities. For such identified locations, we further assess the risks and potential impacts, on which we base the development of strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Our climate change resilience analysis was revisited in 2024. When conducting our resilience analysis, we identify factors that apply to Elisa’s operations over the short, medium and long term. Based on our resilience analysis locations of operation in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe will not be signifi­ cantly affected by climate change in the short term. We have identified that Elisa has operations in areas with, for example, water scarcity vulnerabilities. Drought does not have direct impact on Elisa’s operations in short term. We use resilience analysis findings in Elisa’s Climate Transition Plan, to ensure alignment with related strategic and tactical actions across the organisation. It also has implications to financial planning. Elisa’s dependencies on the value chain, and especially the supply chain and its performance in climate transition, impacts on risks and, to some degree, on opportunities, as well as our corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As an organisation, we are continuing our work on mitigating global warming by reducing our carbon footprint, to ensure actions for target of a 1.5°C global average temperature rise, while simultaneously adapting operations for a scenario of up to 3°C. We already see that regulation is a key driver of ambitious environmental targets for European companies, not only for climate, but also in aligning with planetary boundaries overall. We aim for solid, longer-term strategies that integrate sustainability with Elisa’s digital business operations, enabling us to respond to emerging issues in an increasingly complex and unpredictable world. For the same reasons, we are continuing to experiment to drive rapid learning and innovation. Potential climate-related hazards in Elisa’s operations We have identified the following climate-related hazards in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe, over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons: Short term (0–2 years) • Extreme weather events, such as severe winter storms • Flooding of vulnerable locations during heavy rainfall • Wildfires becoming more intense and frequent Medium term (3–5 years) • Longer heatwaves and extreme temperature events • Increased precipitation and seasonally heavy rainfall Long term (over 5 years) • Droughts becoming more frequent and prolonged • Rising sea levels, leading to coastal erosion and flooding 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

"operations, we analyse climate extremes and future changes in climate over the next three decades. We have utilised information sources and tools that consider climate chan­ ge-related factors that are the most relevant for our operations including flooding, severe storms and wildfire hazards. We also cover the susceptibility of society to climate change. According to this analysis, both Finland and Estonia have relatively low climate change exposures and vulnerabilities, but some of our international offices have higher risks in some areas. GHG removal and mitigation projects Elisa’s long-term goals (Net-zero 2040) allow us, in accordance with the recommendation of the SBTi initiative, to use only removal-type carbon credit projects for neutralisation of carbon emissions. This means that, at most, 10 percent of emissions at that point can be covered by carbon removal through carbon credits. We prioritise abatement within our value chain, and we are continuously investigating ways to reduce carbon emissions together with various stakeholders. We are currently focused on our near-term, science-based target for 2030, with a 42 percent reduction in all scopes of emissions. We will not use carbon credits for near-term target. Elisa is nevertheless already investing in additional mitigation actions beyond the near- and long-term science-based targets. Currently, Elisa has not developed any projects in its own operations or value chain for GHG emission removal or storage, but as part of Elisa’s CTP, we are exploring oppor­ tunities in this area. However, Elisa adopted the practice of beyond-value-chain mitigation already in 2020, with the scope of annually acquiring carbon credits in an amount equal to the remaining emissions in our own operations, meaning from fuels (Scope 1) and a small portion of other energy usage (Scope 2), as well as from waste and from business travel and employee commuting, including remote working (Scope 3). Beyond-value-chain mitigation thus comprises a valuable aspect in building the sustainable service offering that Elisa provides to its customers. Our selected carbon credit projects also have co-benefits for people and nature. Over time, Elisa has built a carbon credit portfolio with a variety of high-quality projects of different types and on different continents, according to the following motivations: • Mitigate risks with a well-balanced portfolio • Predictability for high-quality carbon credits • Benefit financially from strategic procurement • Adress Elisa’s geographical value chain impacts • Test and learn about available opportunities to support our transition When reviewing, deciding, and procuring carbon credits, we do due diligence as follows: • Additionality: The project reduces carbon emissions that are not reduced through other initiatives. • Leakage prevention: Emission reductions from the project do not leak to other locations or activities. • Permanence: The project permanently prevents the carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. • Verifiability: An objective third party confirms that emission reductions from the project are credible. • Other risk assessment: The project e.g. avoids very high-risk countries. Elisa purchased carbon credits from projects that are of high quality, verified by standard bodies like Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The methodologies of these standards ensure accurate quantification and verification for various mitigation technologies and processes. To further lessen risks in the quality of carbon credits, we do additional vetting to the extent possible together with selected partners. We follow developments in methodologies and actively engage in dialogue with providers and other experts or stakeholders, to continuously develop Elisa’s carbon credit portfolio. 69 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets.

"Elisa is one of Finland’s largest mobile device retailers, which is why the resources used for manufacturing of devices is material for us. In our role as a service provider, we can have a positive impact on electronic waste and the environment by offering solutions that extend the lifespan and data-secure recycling of devices. The company follows statutory regulations and instructions, also when building its networks. In building and maintaining our network, we have a process for reusing equipment; if doing so is not practically feasible for technical reasons nor financially viable due to, for example, poor energy efficiency, the material of hardware is recycled. In our office premises, recycling and waste management is organised by local partner. Waste-related data is collected through Elisa’s sustainability reporting and monitoring system and is based on data from partners or their own estimates. Performance against the target is monitored in CRMB as well as in relevant Elisa operations. Elisa is committed to supporting solutions designed for circularity through eco-design and extending product lifetimes. This includes reusing, repairing and refurbishing products to enhance their durability, reparability and recyclability, all of which are key components of the transition towards a more circular economy. We are reducing our reliance on new raw material inputs, and our aim is to prioritise sourcing circular alternatives and increasing materials recovery within our own operations. Our commitment extends to seeking the sustainable sourcing of materials, prioritising circular alternatives in our supply chain and safeguarding the health and safety of the workforce. These efforts are in line with the cascading principle of renewable resource use, which emphasises responsible and efficient utilisation of resources. Elisa engages consumers in circular thinking, for example by increasing awareness and promoting device recycling through incentives for customers. We also continue to expand our sustainable and circular offerings, for example through device-as-a-service business models. Resource inflows Manufactured electronic devices, network technologies and batteries make up the majority of inflowing materials. We utilise these technologies to operate our networks and to provide services and products to our customers and end users. These devices and technologies utilise metals and minerals, including some critical and rare materials. Many of these materials have few or no available substitutes and cannot be replaced. Additionally, the inflow also includes batteries, which can include some precious metals. Resource inflows in 2024 Total weight of resource inflow products including packaging (kg) 79,199,692 Percentage of biological materials including packaging (%) 0.4 The absolute weight of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials including packaging (kg) 0 Percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials (%) 0 Accounting principles – Resource inflows The data includes Elisa Corporation (Finland) and Elisa Eesti As as the resource inflow is most relevant to these businesses. The total weight of products includes all of the manufactured materials, electronic devices and network technologies procured during 2024. The weight data is collected from Elisa’s procurement system, where the supplier provided data is used when available. In case such data is not available, we have used researched estimations. The biological material used or acquired is insignificant, thus we estimate it to be close to zero. Weight and share of secondary reused or recycled materials are estimated to be negligible and thus zero, as we do not have adequate and accurate data to do any justified calculations. To ensure accuracy, we have diligently avoided double counting by using the data from Elisa’s procurement system only once and have used third party assurance of data and calculations. 76 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Resource outflows – Waste Elisa does not manufacture or produce any of the products it offers in the market. Elisa operates as a retailer, supplying products to customers. In this capacity, the resource inflows and outflows – including the products and their packaging volumes – are nearly equivalent. Concerning our network operations, facilities, office premises and businesses, our resource outflows result mainly from electronic waste, which typically includes network equipment, other electronics and batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) and in addition packaging. The amount of office waste is minimal in Elisa’s waste volume, and we adhere to the waste management principles of reducing, reusing and recycling, in collaboration with local waste management partners. Elisa operates under the Extended Producer Responsibility principles by recycling electronic devices, batteries and accu­ mulators, as well as packaging material. Replaced network equipment is either reused in our own operations, sold to the second-hand market or recycled through our third-party partner. The pieces of equipment that are handed over to a third-party partner for further refurbishment and sales are first collected and examined by Elisa to assess whether they are commercially viable, before being packaged for transporta­ tion. Our shops in Finland and Estonia have WEEE collection receptacles for consumer electronic consumables, through which e.g. devices are taken for re-processing to become materials for new electronic products. Our shops in Finland have specific collection boxes for recycling mobile devices and other portable devices. We offer monetary compensation for phones eligible for reuse, for example, when purchasing a new device. Collected devices are repaired, refurbished and reintroduced to the market for consumers, contributing to the circular economy. Additionally, Elisa also complies with local laws as part of producer responsibility, for example in Finland regarding the recycling of packing waste Total waste generated in 2024 Total amount of waste (kg) 838,763 Non-recycled waste (kg) 219,803 Non-recycled waste (%) 26 Total amount of hazardous waste (kg) 356,435 Total waste diverted from disposal (kg) 675,699 Hazardous waste (kg) 356,415 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 356,415 Other recovery operations (kg) N/A Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 319,284 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 262,545 Other recovery operations (kg) 56,739 Total waste directed to disposal (kg) 163,065 Hazardous waste (kg) 20 Incineration (kg) N/A Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) 20 Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 163,045 Incineration (kg) 163,045 Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) N/A Accounting principles – Resource outflows – Waste The data includes all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. Elisa’s waste volumes consist of materials generated directly across various facilities (such as offices, shops and network infrastructure sites) and are predominantly linked to our business operations. Most of the waste is comprised of battery waste and WEEE (encompassing technology equipment and consumer electronic products), as well as metal and packaging waste. In addition, office waste forms a minor portion of our total waste volume and typically includes materials such as paper, cardboard and biowaste. The composition of these waste streams includes several types of materials, notably minerals, metals and critical materials from technology equipment and batteries, plastics from packaging materials and biomass from office biowaste. Waste data is systematically gathered through reports from our waste management partners or building management, ensuring accuracy. In cases where actual data is unavailable, particularly in certain office locations, estimates based on office headcount are used, as this directly correlates with waste generation. However, the estimated data amounts to less than 3 percent of Elisa’s total waste volume. 77 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

For further details see section 8.1 ‘Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss’ of the Universal Registration Document. Similar to previous years, Euronext has reviewed the application of the EU Taxonomy Regulation to its activities, taking into account the list of economic activities outlined in the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Euronext has concluded that it has no eligible or aligned turnover under the Taxonomy Regulation. This includes CCM 8.1 where it was assessed Euronext does not have eligible turnover. For a full list of Euronext's activities, please refer to section 7.1.3 of the Universal Registration Document on Sources of Revenue. 3.2.1.1.2 Operating Expenditure In compliance with the Disclosure Delegated Act, total OpEx is calculated by assessing all direct non-capitalised costs related to research and development, building renovation measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair, as well as other direct expenditures necessary for the day-to-day servicing of property, plant, and equipment assets. This assessment is then compared with the economic activities defined in the various Annexes to the Climate and Environmental Delegated Acts. Euronext Operational Expenditures are related to assets and processes associated with Taxonomy eligible economic activities. In the previous year, due to the lack of clarity on OpEx denominator calculation, it was decided to use the same OpEx as the one in the financials. For 2024, with more clarity over methodology from taxonomy, it was calculated using only categories that are aligned with those from taxonomy regulation like: ■Software and hardware maintenance; ■Facilities services and repair. ■Buildings renovations. ■Short-term leases. There are no other operational expenditures related to day to day servicing items related to Property, Plant, and Equipment that are not identified in the categories above. In 2024 Euronext identified activities related to facilities and data centres maintenance that were able to be classified as eligible for OpEx. 3.2.1.1.3 Capital Expenditure Under the EU Taxonomy Regulation, the CapEx denominator is defined as the total capital expenditure reported in the financial statements, encompassing investments in property, plant, and equipment (PPE) in accordance with IAS 16, right-of- use assets under IFRS 16, and intangible assets as defined by IAS 38, excluding goodwill. This figure is presented without depreciation, amortization, remeasurement, or changes to fair value.

Additionally, for more details on remuneration structure, refer to the Remuneration report on section 4.4 of the Universal Registration Document. 3.2.2.2 Strategy Between 2021 and 2024, under its ""Growth for Impact 2024"" strategic plan, Euronext focused on accelerating climate action—both within Euronext’s own operations and through its role in advancing sustainable finance across all its markets. This commitment also encompassed an ambitious 1.5° climate goal for Euronext, and included developing services and products that help businesses, partners, clients and the European economy in general to ensure the increase in global temperatures from pre-industrial times remains below the 1.5°C target, as set out in the Paris Agreement. For the next strategic cycle “Innovate for Growth 2027"" 2024-2027, Euronext has renewed its commitment to support its clients throughout their climate journey, and further develop efficient ESG products and advisory services. Additionally, Euronext committed to set science-based net zero targets by 2027 in its own operations. In this context, Euronext has joined the Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance, part of the global coalition ‘Race to Zero’. Euronext’s climate strategy is detailed in the company's Transition Plan, outlining the key measures Euronext is taking to align its activities with a sustainable future. Central to this strategy are Euronext's decarbonisation commitments, which guide its efforts to reduce emissions in line with global climate goals. To operationalise Euronext’s climate strategy, the company has established a robust internal framework which is outlined in the Environmental Policy. Furthermore, Euronext’s detailed action plan highlights the concrete steps Euronext has already implemented, ensuring accountability and progress as the Group transitions towards a more sustainable and resilient operational model. Undertaken actions in 2024 are detailed in section 3.2.2.3.2. of the Universal Registration Document 3.2.2.2.1 Transition plan for climate change mitigation and adaptation (E1-1) Euronext disclosed in 2024 the latest version of its climate transition plan, demonstrating to capital markets and stakeholders that the company is committed to achieving a 1.5° pathway, and that its business model will remain relevant (i.e., profitable) in a net-zero carbon economy. This document has been approved by the Managing Board in September 2023 and can be found on Euronext's website. Any future amendments will be subject to the same approval process. Euronext's Climate Transition Plan outlines the company's transition toward a low-carbon economy, detailing its Fit 1.5 strategy, key actions, milestones, and ambitions. The Transition Plan also sheds light on Euronext's environmental governance framework. Euronext’s business model does not have locked-in emissions. Unlike industries reliant on physical infrastructure or production-based carbon outputs, the company’s operations focus on facilitating financial transactions and services. The infrastructure the Group uses, such as its buildings and data centres, has a relatively lower environmental footprint and offers greater flexibility for decarbonisation. Additionally, Euronext does not operate in a CapEx-intensive industry and, therefore, does not have a CapEx plan linked to its transition plan. However, Euronext may in the future have some Taxonomy-aligned CapEx and/or OpEx reflecting its efforts to greenify its buildings and IT infrastructure. 3 Empower Sustainable Finance 98 2024 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT"

Material by 2050 Heat stress could lead to significant increases in expenditure associated with additional energy usage for increased cooling requirements, and additional expenditure if additional HVAC systems require installation. B Heat Waves An extended period of hot weather relative to the expected conditions of the area at that time of year, which may be accompanied by high humidity. Material by 2030 The high proportion of sites which could be impacted by heatwaves could lead to significant increases in expenditure associated with additional energy usage for increased cooling requirements, and additional expenditure if additional HVAC systems require installation. C Water Stress Water stress occurs when the demand for water exceeds the available amount during a certain period or when poor quality restricts its use. Material at baseline Stress on water availability could lead to increased expenditures if the cost of water increases. There may also be disruptions to operations if there are caps on water usage. D Storm Events of winds ranging from 75 to 88 km/h, with heavy storms reaching speeds from 89 to 102 km/h. This risk includes blizzards, dust and sandstorms. Material by 2050 There is a general projected increase in severe windstorms in the countries of Basic-Fit’s operations and the severity of the potential impacts related to storms. These impacts could include increase expenditure for general maintenance following storm events e.g., fixing roofs or clearing flood waters. There may be reduced revenue if clubs need to shut following damages from a serious storm event."
"1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 Likelihood Financial effect R1 R2 O1 Key Risk 2030 2040 2050 Opportunity low to medium medium to high high to very high Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 44 Transitional risks and opportunities Description Category Outlook Justification R1 Volatile energy prices Several factors could drive energy prices up in the short to medium term, including stricter carbon pricing regulations (such as the EU ETS and taxes) and investment slowdown in new fossil projects, leading to supply-demand impairment. Additionally, increased reliance on renewable sources like solar and wind can contribute to price volatility due to their variable nature and dependency on weather conditions. Transition Risk Material by 2030 As a value-for-money business focused on efficiency, volatile energy prices pose a significant risk directly affecting the company's cost structure and profitability. Although scenarios suggest a long-term decrease in electricity prices, fluctuations due to geopolitical factors, technology readiness, and weather variability could result in increased operational expenditure. R2 Internal global supply chain decarbonisation efforts Basic-Fit primarily relies on suppliers which manufacture in Asia for its fitness equipment. The construction and transportation of this equipment present environmental impacts. Although Basic-Fit does not operate in a high- emitting sector, substantial efforts and changes may be required if the company engages in decarbonizing its upstream indirect emissions. Material by 2030 The risk associated with Basic-Fit’s supply chain decarbonisation effort is expected to peak by 2030, potentially significantly impacting expenditure. Increased scrutiny from regulators and investors is pressuring companies to reduce value chain emissions, which may raise costs, particularly for greener transport services and club furnishing material. In the medium to long term, initial supplier investments in decarbonisation are expected to eventually reduce cost pressures. O1 Proactive management of energy consumption Basic-Fit can achieve operational savings through improved energy management and efficiency measures. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, upgrading its heating and cooling systems, and further electrifying its vehicle fleet, Basic- Fit can reduce energy costs and minimise its environmental impact. Transition Opportunity Material by 2030 Managing energy consumption presents significant cost-saving opportunities for Basic-Fit. As energy is a major expense, cost-efficient reductions directly increase the company’s profitability. Since launching its heating and cooling system retrofitting program, Basic-Fit has seen a return on investment through improved energy efficiency and reduced expenditure with each upgrade"
"Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 45 Energy powering our operations Controlling our use of energy and ensuring that it comes from renewable sources is key to the reduction of our direct emissions. It also helps us also to improve the cost efficiency of our club operations. As such, Basic-Fit sees energy use as a strategically important topic. In broad terms, energy consumed in Basic-Fit operations consists primarily of purchased electricity and gas for running clubs and offices, self-generated renewable energy from solar panels and fuel for company vehicles. Sources of energy consumed Country Energy from fossil sources (MWh) Energy from nuclear sources (MWh) Energy from renewable sources Total (MWh) Purchased (MWh) Self- generated (MWh) Belgium 12,892 114 33,747 106 46,859 Germany 3,316 106 77 - 3,499 Spain 17,011 10,098 966 - 28,075 France 16,105 103,385 5,560 - 125,050 Luxembourg - - 1,929 - 1,929 Netherlands 15,310 2 37,202 1,478 53,991 Total 64,634 113,706 79,480 1,584 259,404 Basic-Fit has taken some actions in 2024 to address our negative impacts on the environment. This includes the installation of solar panels, heat pumps, efficient water boilers and HVAC control systems. These actions were taken with the expected outcome of reducing our energy consumption and related emissions. You can find more information on these actions in Note 2.3 of the Financial Statements. Renewable energy production Country Own use (MWh) Reselling to grid (MWh) Total (MWh) Belgium 106 5 112 Netherlands 1,478 357 1,835 Total 1,584 363 1,947 Methodology Notes The data regarding sources of energy used1 covers Basic-Fit’s club operation and energy use in offices. It is disaggregated by country. Company leased cars and self-generated renewable energy are also taken into account in these results. Actual electricity data was available for 73% of clubs and gas data for 68% of relevant clubs. In cases where actual energy consumption data for 2024 was unavailable, we calculated the median energy usage per club per square metre for each country, using actual data sourced directly from energy suppliers and smart meters. This information was then used to estimate energy consumption for clubs without data, based on their size (in square metres). Regarding the disaggregation of energy by sources, we applied the following: 1 The electricity purchased in France, Spain, and Germany was disaggregated based on information from national suppliers or energy authorities regarding country-level electricity generation sources. Basic-Fit intends to purchase GOs for total electricity consumption in 2024, with the purchase planned for 2025 once electricity consumption data has been settled, and the actual consumption is known. As a result, the energy mix indicated in this report may be updated accordingly. 2 In the Netherlands and Belgium, all electricity purchased was classified as renewable based on purchased guarantees of origin (GOs) certifying that electricity comes from renewable sources. 3 In Luxembourg, the energy contract certifies that all electricity comes from renewable sources. 1 This means the 'Sources of energy consumed' table presents totals for the following disclosures: E1-5 37a, 37b, 37cii and 37ciii. 37ci is not applicable to Basic-Fit."
"Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 46 4 Gas consumption is accounted as ‘energy from fossil sources’. 5 Fuel consumption by company leased cars is accounted for as ‘energy from fossil sources’ and is based on data from fleet reports. An assumption of 5.5 L/100km was applied for fuel consumption. Energy consumption from electric company- leased cars is considered under purchased electricity. Regarding the disclosure requirement applicable to high climate impact sectors (disaggregation of sources as per paragraph 38), we consider this does not apply to Basic-Fit, as we deem our operations to be classified under NACE 2 section R code 93.13 ‘Activities of fitness facilities’, whilst the ESRS defines high climate impact sectors as those listed in NACE Sections A to H and L. Regarding renewable energy production data from our solar panels (E1-5 39), we had access to actual solar generation data for all relevant clubs. In cases where a club produced more renewable energy than it could consume, the excess energy was returned to the grid. The amount of renewable energy sold is based on actual data from the energy supplier and is reported in the table ""renewable energy production"". The difference between the self-generated renewable energy produced and sold is reported in the table 'Sources of energy consumed', under self-generated renewable energy (E1-5 37ciii). Basic-Fit did not engage in the production of non-renewable energy (E1-5 39). GHG Emissions Last year, we undertook a full calculation of our emissions inventory, updating our calculations of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and for the first time measuring our Scope 3 emissions. In summary, the emissions comprise the following: Scope 1 emissions relate to gas consumption in clubs and offices, travel using vehicles leased by Basic-Fit, and refrigerant fluids used in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration machines. Scope 2 emissions are related to the indirect emissions based on the electricity purchased by Basic-Fit. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption as reported under E1-5. The Scope 2 emissions reported here include the gross location-based and market-based emissions. Scope 3 emissions are calculated after assessing the applicability of the corresponding 15 categories in the GHG protocol. Applicable categories are included in the GHG emissions table below. The following Scope 3 categories were excluded from the calculation: • Upstream and Downstream Leased Assets: Leased assets, including vehicles and buildings, were accounted for under other categories, as they are integral to Basic-Fit’s operations. • Processing of Sold Products: Basic-Fit does not engage in the sale of intermediate products. • Franchises: Basic-Fit did not operate franchises in 2024. 2 Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE 2.1) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902521/KS-RA-07-015-EN.PDF]"

CTP presents GHG emission data using the financial control approach as required by the ESRS and the operational control approach commonly used in the real estate industry. The GHG emissions disclosed in this Annual Re- port relate to the Group and its value chain in relation to purchased goods and services, which are focused on the materials CTP uses for construction activities; and to downstream leased assets, which focus on emissions as a result of client operations. See Section 4.4 for more information on CTP’s structure. Using publicly available emission factors, CTP converted all energy consumption to tCO2e. Emission factors were obtained from carbonfootprint.com (for electricity) and the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (“DEFRA”) (for fuels). For district heat- ing, CTP uses data from relevant ministries of the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland. For refrigerant losses, the Company uses the GHG Protocol list. These sources were applied across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 and were chosen as they are reputable and publicly available. Data for Q4 2024 was estimated by extrapolating actual data for the first three quarters of the year. Q4 was calculated as the mathematical average of Q1–Q3 and added to Q1–Q3 to calculate full-year data. CTP obtained energy consumption data from 80% of its portfolio. Therefore, estimates have been made to ensure 100% portfolio representation. Data was extrapolated by calculating the energy intensity for each country using obtained data and multiplying this with the floor area for which no data was obtained. The extrapola- tion together with an increase in emission factors are the main drivers of the increase in reported emissions.

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 125 4.7.1.2.4 Targets related to resource use and circular economy E5-3-21, E5-3-23, E5-ESRS-2-72 CTP generates a significant amount of waste during its construction activities. The Company has set a voluntary target related to waste management: increase the im- plementation of selective waste collection to 95% of all its construction activities by 2030, compared to 45% in 2023. This target applies to its own projects, independ- ent of location, size, or building type. The progress on this target is measured on an annual basis, through external reporting. This target promotes the reduction of the amount of waste going to landfill and has been formu- lated this way taking into account the maturity of waste handling systems in different countries and locations where CTP operates (stakeholders, such as suppliers and local teams, have been taken into account). For this reason, bearing in mind the limitations stem- ming from it, CTP decided to first focus on the promo- tion of waste-handling practices that allow for the re- use and recycling of materials. It is expected to support progress in waste management, allowing CTP to set up further targets in the future. CTP indirectly addresses the increase of circular materi- al use rate and the minimisation of primary raw materi- als. This is done through the embodied emissions reduc- tion target. CTP has not yet developed targets related to re- source inflows and circular economy. CTP is considering the development of targets, but has set no timeline. CTP tracks the effectiveness of its policies through internal processes, in which management and senior manage- ment are involved. 4.7.1.2.3 Actions and recourses E5-2-17, E5-2-19, E5-ESRS-2-62 Selective waste collection, which includes recycling, is an integral part of the BREEAM New Construction certi- fication process for CTP’s buildings. These actions are ongoing. Through their implementation, CTP expects to increase waste diverted from landfills, i.e., increasing re- cycling and reuse rates. This action is planned to assist CTP in achieving its 2030 target, as explained in Section 4.7.1.2.4. Actions will be further developed in the future. Additionally, CTP implements requirements for its con- struction and refurbishment activities to obtain EU tax- onomy alignment that include waste management. CTP considers CapEx and OpEx related to these ac- tions as part of business as usual. The resources allocated to managing material im- pacts are considered part of normal business operations. CTP is currently collecting data on the inflow of ma- terials, which will enable the creation of informed actions.

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 33 3.1 Overview of Business Environment & Trends CTP operates in ten European countries, from the North Sea to the Black Sea. The Group’s core business, the CTPark Network, services companies active in the industrial & logistics (“I&L”) sector. CTP is also focused on developing and operating advanced high-tech parks in conjunction with local universities and municipalities. The majority of CTP’s standing portfolio is in Central and Eastern Europe (“CEE”), with the remainder in Germany, the Netherlands, and Austria. In general, CEE markets remain undersupplied and are growing faster than Western European markets. The major trends driving the development and growth of the I&L sector across Europe relate to recent and ongo- ing changes to the international geopolitical landscape, with companies focusing on supply chain resiliency and energy security, among others. This has led the emer- gence of nearshoring strategies, particularly in the high- tech manufacturing and ICT sectors, with a “made in Europe, for Europe” focus. The push toward ESG compli- ance and the need to decarbonise supply chains are also driving change. Western Europe remains a highly attractive destina- tion for foreign investors due to its mature and estab- lished markets, which offer stability and reliability. While the region boasts a long history of excellence in manu- facturing and technology, and world-renowned academ- ic institutions, Western European economies are in the midst of re-invention. They are are being transformed by emerging new industries, and previous more energy- and labour-intensive industries are being displaced or disap- pearing. CEE remains the business-smart choice for a wide range of activities, from high-tech manufacturing and R&D to logistics and e-commerce. With its mix of strate- gic location, developed infrastructure, skilled workforce, and overall lower operational costs, CEE is emerging as a “hotspot” for the deployment of European nearshoring strategies. Market maturity varies from country to coun- try, but CEE overall offers more opportunity for green- field investments than Western European markets. The European Union (“EU”) continues to make largescale investments to further develop transport infrastructure, with a focus on CEE. Investment incentives from the Member States are available for qualifying projects, par- ticularly in high-tech. 3.1.1 Economic situation and outlook in CEE Since 2008, CEE economies have consistently outper- formed other European regions and are expected to maintain this trend in the near term (Fig. 3.1). The mac- roeconomic outlook for CEE economies remains strong. After hitting a low point in 2023, economic growth has rebounded, driven by domestic demand fuelled by disin- flation, wage increases, and relaxed fiscal policies. On average, the GDP of CEE economies are expected to have a compounded annual growth (“CAGR”) of 2.2% between 2024–2029 (Fig. 3.1). S&P Global Ratings an- ticipates that CEE GDP growth will also benefit from robust foreign direct investment and substantial EU fund inflows. These factors are expected to more than cover any modest current account deficits, following the region’s significant external adjustment after the 2022 energy price shock. Germany, the largest economy in Europe with a real GDP of €3.617 billion in 2023, is projected to maintain its leading position in the next few decades, although its share of the EU’s total real GDP is expected to decrease slightly, from 21% to 20%. In terms of private consump- tion and total real household disposable income, Germany significantly outpaces the rest of Europe."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 123 4.7.1.1.8 Financial effects of climate IROs E1-9-66, E1-9-67, E1-9-68, E1-9-69, SBM-3-48, E1-IRO-1-20 In 2022, as a part of overall risk management, CTP con- ducted its first physical climate risk assessment to evalu- ate the exposure of its properties to acute and chronic cli- mate-related risks using a third-party climate modelling tool. The assessment was expanded in 2023 and 2024 to cover properties acquired and developed since 2022. In this assessment, the Company used different RCP models made available by the IPCC, considering items such as, but not limited to, coastal flooding, extreme heat, and water stress. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. The climate-related risks identified as potentially the most impactful to CTP are coastal flooding and rising sea levels. These have been categorised into short-, mid-, and long-term risks. Even in the least severe scenarios (SSP2, medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation), projections indicate that sea levels will rise significantly enough that, in the long term, the Company’s portfolio in the Netherlands could be affected, with some assets po- tentially falling below sea level. This is similarly true for a limited number of properties along the German Wadden Sea coast. However, CTP regards these risks as policy risks, given that both Dutch and German governments are implementing measures to mitigate them. Based on its analysis, CTP concludes that five of its properties1 are at risk, representing, at most, 1.2% of the portfolio’s value. As part of the climate risk assessment mentioned above, transition climate risks were also examined. CTP utilised the CRREM tool developed by the Carbon Risk Real Es- tate Monitor to evaluate which buildings might need ad- ditional investment to increase energy efficiency in order to meet anticipated regulatory requirements. However, given that CTP buildings support a variety of uses, even within a CRREM category, the Company ac- knowledges limitations to the applicability of the CRREM tool on its portfolio. Client energy consumption is includ- ed in the analysis and can vary significantly depending on the client’s industry. For instance, the size of the cold storage area within a warehouse is not considered as an input, although it significantly influences the building’s energy consumption and thus affects the outcome of the assessment. With the expected impacts of the EU’s En- ergy Performance Buildings Directive (“EPBD”), which was revised in 2024, CTP considers other aspects such as the Energy Performance Certificate (“EPC”) to be more accurate indicators of the energy efficiency of its buildings. CRREM was used as a testing and indication tool, while EPCs were used for a more precise assessment of transition climate risks. CTP continuously upgrades its portfolio to ensure that it retains its high energy clas- sifications. Construction of new buildings follows up-to- date requirements and CTP’s internal ESG requirements, which in many cases go beyond local building code re- quirements. Expected costs related to material and tran- sition climate risks have been calculated for a sample of properties, the outcome of which is presented in Section 4.7.1.1.1. The impact of the both physical and transition related cli- mate risks is expressed in the property values, as these go through a bi-annual evaluation process. CTP uses re- nowned valuators to ensure all climate-related aspects are taking into account. Additionally, properties are in- sured. Therefore, CTP considers expected costs as part of business as usual. CTP has not identified transition risks that are financially material to the portfolio over the short and medium term. Additionally, the long-term impact of physical cli- mate risks is presented in the paragraphs above, while the long-term impact of transition risks is considered as too volatile to be reliable. The volatility of energy prices in Europe in recent years have made CTP’s clients more aware of the short- and long-term costs of energy. There was a visible increase in client demand for energy from renewable sources during 2024. CTP expects its abili- ty to provide clients with renewable energy generated onsite at its parks, as well as other energy-efficiency measures that the Company takes, to attract more com- panies that consider total cost of occupancy as a main driver. See Section 4.7.1.1.2 for more information related to CTP’s climate risk modelling. CTP is a dynamic company with continuous growth through construction and acquisitions. The consistent arrival of new clients and ongoing changes to their oper- ations affect the consumption of utilities within the port- folio. This makes the creation of metrics difficult and re- quires more detailed analysis. Despite these limitations, CTP carried out an analysis of its clients, which confirms that none of its clients operate in the coal, oil, or gas- related sectors. 1 Properties located in NUTS Code areas NL3, DE8, and DE9."

CTP’s four Core markets—the Czech Republic, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia—represent almost 73% of the Group’s total owned GLA. CTP’s average market share in those markets stood at 28.8% as at 31 Decem- ber 2024, and the Group remains the largest owner and developer of industrial and logistics real estate assets in each Core market. The Group is also the market leader in Serbia and Bulgaria. With over 1,000 clients, CTP has a wide and diversified international client base, consisting of blue-chip compa- nies with strong credit ratings. CTP’s clients represent a broad range of industries, including manufacturing, high- tech/IT, automotive, and e-commerce, retail, wholesale, and third-party logistics. This client base is highly di- versified, with no single client accounting for more than 2.5% of its annual rent roll, which leads to a stable income stream. CTP’s top 50 clients only account for 35.2% of its rent roll and most are in multiple CTPark locations."

"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Business Environment & 2024 Performance 41 3.2.2 Standing portfolio CTP develops, owns and manages a high-quality portfo- lio of assets in over 250 locations. The Group increased its investment portfolio from 11.8 million sqm of owned GLA in 2023 to 13.3 million sqm at end-2024. Growth was mainly organic, with deliveries of 1.3 million sqm and the acquisition of 0.3 million sqm of value-add and in- come-producing assets. With its market-leading portfo- lio throughout continental Europe, the Group’s business generates strong cash flows. CTP can realise the highest incremental return with the development of new properties in our CTPark Network, as these are developed in-house, on land that it has already paid for and mostly for existing clients, which is why such deliveries are the main driver of the Company’s growth. The Group’s annualised income increased to €743 million (31 December 2023: €644 million), an increase year-on-year of 15%. An increasing proportion of the rental income gener- ated by CTP’s investment portfolio benefits from infla- tion protection. Since end-2019, all the Group’s new lease agreements include a double indexation clause, which cal- culates annual rental increases as the higher of: • a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year; or • the Consumer Price Index. As at 31 December 2024, 71% (31 December 2023: 66%) of income generated by the Group’s portfolio includes this double indexation clause, and the Group aims to in- crease this further. The remaining 29% of the portfolio has only a fixed increase of 1.5%–2.5% a year, and there- fore more reversionary potential built-in. The indexation takes place on 1 January of each year in the majority of the lease agreements. Therefore, the growth in rental in- come relating to 2024 inflation will only be recorded in the 2025. The Company’s occupancy stood at 93% at year-end (31 December 2023: 94%). CTP targets an occupancy rate around 95% with a few percentage points of va- cancy, as this flexibility is key to optimise client relation- ships and drive rental growth. CTP’s business model and strategy are focused on being a long-term business part- ner, to support existing clients to grow in their existing location or at another park within the CTPark Network. Some of CTP’s clients have already extended more than five times in their existing location. CTP therefore starts some developments before having secured pre-letting; however, this is concentrated in existing parks, where the Company has good visibility on future demand and deep market knowledge. This allows CTP to maintain a mar- ket-leading client retention rate of 87% (31 December 2023: 90%), which demonstrates CTP’s ability to lever- age long-standing client relationships. The rent collection level stabilised at 99.8% (31 De- cember 2023: 99.9%), with no deterioration in the pay- ment profile. In 2024, CTP realised a like-for-like growth of 4.0%, mainly driven by reversion and indexation. Countries with the highest like-for-like rental growth were Slovakia and Poland. The weighted average unexpired lease term (“WAULT”) of CTP’s investment portfolio stood at 6.4 years at the period end (31 December 2023: 6.6 years), in line with the Company’s target of >6 years. The reversionary potential stands at 14.5% as at 31 December 2024 (31 December 2023: 14.5%), illustrat- ing the future rental growth potential. The Group has the highest reversionary potential in the Germany with 25.9%. Based on the expiry schedule, the Group is expected to be able to capture more than 28% of the reversionary potential in the coming five years. During 2024, leases, on average, were signed above their estimated rental val- ue (“ERV”), supporting both the Group’s reversionary po- tential and valuations."

Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 124 4.7.1.2 ESRS E5 – Material Resource Use and Circular Economy 4.7.1.2.1 Material IROs relating to material resource use and circular economy E5-IRO-1-11 As part of the 2024 DMA, material resource use and cir- cular economy (ESRS E5) was identified as a material top- ic, applicable to all business units and assets considering the development, construction, and operational phases of these assets. The IROs mentioned in this section of the report are based on a business-as-usual scenario. If CTP does not act on these IROs, there is a potential increase in construction cost. CTP’s 2024 DMA process identified the following cir- cular economy ESRS sub-topics as material: E5 – Resource use and circular economy Waste Resource inflows, including resource use Summary • Only actual negative impacts, and no risks or oppor- tunities, have been identified. Resource inflows and outflows are resources related to CTP’s construction activities. • No related risks and opportunities were identified. • The following materials are used by CTP as part of its business activities and prioritised in this order: 1) steel/iron; 2) concrete and related products; and 3) asphalt. • Affected communities were not identified for this topic. • CTP has not identified any operations or geographies at significant risk of incidents of forced, child, or compulsory labour. • No types of employees who could be negatively af- fected by the Group’s strategy or business model have been identified. See Section 7.3.1 for a complete overview of material top- ics, including impacts of doing business as usual. 4.7.1.2.2 Policies related to resource use and circular economy E5-1-12, E5-1-14, E5-ESRS-2-62 Waste management is part of CTP’s Environmental Pol- icy. The policy’s objective is to create a systemised ap- proach towards environmental matters and propose rel- evant actions. The policy applies to CTP’s own operations and activities, including incorporating waste manage- ment practices into its construction activities, and cli- ents are not required to comply. The waste hierarchy is not addressed in the current version of the policy, nor are other material matters such as transitioning away from use of virgin resources or sustainable sourcing. CTP plans to revise Environmental Policy in 2025 to develop section concerning waste and materials inflow. The Board of Di- rectors is responsible and accountable for implementing the policy. The ISO 14001 and 50001 management systems are part of the policy, and key stakeholders are considered in the policy. CTP’s Environmental Policy can be found on the Com- pany’s website. CTP also has internal waste management require- ments, which include requirements for new construction and refurbishments. CTP has yet to develop policies related to resource inflows."
"CTP N.V. Annual Report 2024 Sustainability 128 4.7.2 Pillar 2: Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being CTP’s ESG strategy pillar “Stimulating Social Impact & Well-being” contains all social-related material disclo- sures as identified in the Group’s 2024 DMA process, which indicate the following ESRS categories as material for the Company: S1 Own workforce S2 Workers in the value chain As confirmed by the 2024 DMA, CTP’s impact goes be- yond the parks and buildings that it develops, owns and operates. For more information on the results of the DMA, please refer to Section 4.7.4. CTP employs close to 900 of its own employees, with nearly 1,500 clients. Both within the Company and in the communities where it operates, CTP, in collaboration with its clients, local municipalities and NGOs, introduces and/ or supports activities that promote well-being, includ- ing charity donations targeting disadvantaged youth and other vulnerable members of society, support for educa- tion, and job retraining programs. See Section 4.7.2.1.13 for more details. 4.7.2.1 ESRS S1 – Own workforce 4.7.2.1.1 Interests and views of own employees S1 SBM-2-12 Employees were included as a main stakeholder group in CTP’s 2024 DMA, and their views and feedback were taken into consideration in the process of identifying ma- terial topics. CTP’s Employee Engagement Survey, which was launched in 2024 as a yearly process, is another mechanism for Group leadership to gain insight into the interests and views of its employees. Through these two processes, information that informs CTP’s strategy and business model is collected. CTP’s strategy and goal are to increase the GLA and thereby the business. This increases opportunities for and expansion of the workforce, strengthening the identi- fied positive impacts. See Section 7.3.1 for the complete overview of mate- rial ESRS S1 topics. 4.7.2.1.2 Impact of material IROs on strategy and business model S1 SBM-3-13, S1 SBM-3-14, S1 SBM-3-15, S1 SBM-3-16 The Company’s IROs relating to its workforce are con- sidered in strategic decisions and ideas related to CTP’s business model. The identified positive impacts are based on the current strategy of growth within the existing business model. The employee-related IROs described in Section 7.3.1 include all types of employees at CTP. The DMA did not identify negative impacts, risks, or opportunities. The majority of CTP employees are white collar em- ployees, working in project management, business devel- opment, permitting, and different support functions such as finance, HR, legal, and others. While analysing IROs for employees and non-employees are taken into account, these employees are considered to be impacted similarly. Employee recruitment and development risks and opportunities, secure employment, adequate wag- es, social dialogue, work-life balance, training and de- velopment, gender equality and equal pay for work of equal value, diversity, and measures against violence and harassment apply to all CTP employees, includ- ing non-employees, independent of position, age, or gender. More details about employee demographics can be found in Section 4.7.2.1.8. Health and safety aspects apply mainly to employees working on construction sites. At CTP, non-employees are self-employed people. Self-employed is defined as someone pursuing a gainful activity for their own account, under the conditions laid down by national law. This excludes those employees of other companies providing services to CTP."

"105 8.2. Environmental Information Climate Change This chapter includes details on the identified impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) related to climate change, as well as the corresponding policies, actions and targets. Furthermore, BRD Group’s overview on the policies, measures and targets is also presented. Strategy E1-1-17 Transition Plan BRD Group acknowledges the importance of having a transition plan to align with climate goals and support the sustainability transition. While BRD Group does not currently have a formal transition plan in place, it is committed to developing and adopting one within its report for 2027. This timeline reflects the complexity and scope of the transition process, ensuring that the plan will be comprehensive, actionable and aligned with both regulatory requirements and the broader strategic objectives of SG. BRD Group is closely aligning its sustainability initiatives with the overarching strategy of SG. SG has established sustainability goals/targets aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and BRD Group is working to ensure compliance with SG’s commitments, including the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) targets and sector-specific decarbonization pathways. Developing a transition plan that is fully integrated into the Group’s sustainability objectives requires time and coordination. Moreover, the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly under CSRD, requires BRD Group to carefully assess its reporting obligations and integrate sustainability considerations across all business areas. The development of a transition plan is being approached with diligence to meet these evolving requirements effectively. BRD Group is not excluded from the Paris Agreement Benchmarks. Although a formal transition plan is not yet available, BRD Group is actively engaged in sustainability initiatives that contribute to the transition process. These include: - Supporting corporate clients in their sustainability transition through financing solutions such as Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs) and Project Investment Financing (SPIF), focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. - Expanding green financing for retail clients by offering green loans under EU Invest sustainability support schemes and collaborating with energy efficiency solution providers. - Increasing the share of green financing in BRD Sogelease to support industries such as transport decarbonization and circular economy transitions. - Partnering with institutions such as IFC, EIB (through EIF), and EU funds programs to implement sustainability-linked projects.

"123 prioritize financing in sustainable sectors while avoiding environmentally harmful industries. Furthermore, the target contributes to SG’s Climate Policy, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy by financing green projects and reducing exposure to carbon- intensive sectors. It is also in line with the SG Positive Impact Financing Bond Framework, which promotes investments in projects that generate positive environmental and social impacts, such as renewable energy and social inclusion, while ensuring transparent reporting and accountability. The target is also used to track the effectiveness of the “Business plan for sustainable and positive impact financing” disclosed under “Actions Related to Climate Change Adaptation, Climate Change Mitigation and Energy”. This target addresses all climate change mitigation adaptation and energy material impacts, risks and opportunities, apart from the negative impacts related to carbon emissions and the use of non-renewable energy, addressed by Target 2, described below. The target applies to all BRD activities related to sustainable finance, including corporate lending, retail banking. It covers financing activities across downstream value chains, addressing direct clients and potential clients. The geographical scope includes BRD’s operational regions, primarily Romania, with potential contributions from SG Group initiatives across the broader European market. Upstream value chain does not fall under the scope of this target. The target applies to the period 2023-2027, with regular interim milestones to monitor progress. Annual reviews are conducted to ensure alignment with BRD Group's sustainability goals and regulatory expectations, with interim targets set for each year to ensure a steady trajectory towards the 2027 goal. The target is defined using methodologies aligned with international sustainability frameworks and SG/BRD Group’s sustainability strategies. Significant assumptions include the continued availability, stable economic conditions, and increasing client demand for sustainable financial products. Data sources include internal financial reporting systems, regulatory disclosures, and third-party verification mechanisms to ensure accuracy for certain categories (SLL financing). Key stakeholders, including clients, investors, regulatory bodies, and internal sustainability committees, have been actively involved in defining the target. Stakeholder engagement includes consultations with industry experts, partnerships with environmental organizations, and dialogue with policymakers to ensure the target aligns with market needs and regulatory frameworks. Progress towards the sustainable finance target is monitored and reviewed regularly through internal governance structures, in the quarterly monitoring of business strategy and financial reporting systems. Metrics used to track progress include the total volume of sustainable financing, progress towards the established targets, trends of evolution compared to the target. In addition, on an annual basis, we assess the trend of the sustainable finance market. Performance is assessed through quarterly and annual reviews, ensuring that progress remains in line with initial projections and allowing for corrective actions if necessary. This is a quantitative indicator, and no explicit qualitative data is used to monitor progress. Target 2"
"124 Achieve a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline. The target was established in alignment with BRD Group’s strategic vision outlined in the Horizons 2027 strategy, ensuring a cohesive approach to our objectives. It does not however address the policies disclosed in this report. We note that the methodology used to calculate the baseline value for the reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations was internally developed and refers to categories of emissions associated with Scope 1, 2 and selected categories in scope 3, as described above. The target set by us of reduction with 55% of the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027 is set in accordance with the above mentioned methodology. Our goal is to achieve this current target by 2027 and set a new GHG reduction target as part of our future Transition Plan. However, the methodology disclosed in section ""Metrics related to climate change"" as well as the actual values for GHG emissions under Scope 1, 2 and selected categories from scope 3 is different from the methodology used to determine the baseline value for carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations. The defined target is to achieve a 55% absolute reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline of 20,071 tons of CO2 (tCO2). The target is expressed in absolute terms, measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). The target covers BRD Group’s direct operations, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions across all office buildings, branches, data centres, and operational facilities within Romania. It does not currently extend to upstream or down-stream value chains but focuses on emissions under the Group’s direct control, ensuring a significant impact within BRD Group’s geographical operations. BRD Group ensures the consistency of its GHG reduction targets with its GHG inventory boundaries by aligning its emissions accounting and reduction initiatives with internationally recognized standards and frameworks, including the GHG Protocol. The defined target of a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline, covers the same organizational and operational boundaries used in the annual GHG inventory assessment. The GHG inventory encompasses Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, covering direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., company vehicles, heating systems) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, and cooling. Additionally, relevant Scope 3 emissions, namely employee commuting and business travel, are monitored to assess their impact and identify potential reduction opportunities. This approach ensures that BRD Group’s emissions reduction initiatives cover and address all significant sources of operational carbon emissions. BRD Group's integrated environmental management system enables accurate data collection, validation, and reporting across all relevant operational sites. Yearly external audits and reviews are conducted to validate the consistency between the defined GHG targets and the inventory boundaries, ensuring that any adjustments or operational changes (such as new office locations, fleet modifications, or energy procurement strategies) are reflected in both the target and the inventory."
"125 BRD Group has established 2019 as the base year for its GHG emissions reduction target, with a baseline value of 20,071 tCO2 from its own operations. This baseline was determined through a comprehensive assessment of emissions data collected across all operational sites, covering both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and selected Scope 3 categories. The 2019 baseline serves as a reference point for measuring progress and tracking the effectiveness of BRD's emissions reduction initiatives. BRD Group has selected 2019 as the baseline year for its GHG emissions reduction target due to its operational stability and typical consumption levels. While 2020 was a potential candidate for the baseline, it was excluded due to the significant disruption caused by the COVID- 19 pan-demic, which led to abnormal consumption patterns and a reduction in overall operational activity. This drastic reduction in emissions and energy use in 2020 could have negatively influenced the data, making it an unreliable reference for normal operations. To ensure that the baseline is representative of typical activity levels, 2019 was chosen as it reflects a year of normal operational performance without the external disruptions that occurred in 2020. This baseline value was reviewed to ensure that it reflects BRD Group's operational emissions prior to any significant external factors or anomalies. An intensity value GHG reduction target is not yet established. The target period spans from 2019 to 2027. In 2024 it was achieved a reduction of 45% compared to the 2019 baseline. Further reviews and adjustments are planned annually to ensure the Group remains on track to achieve its final 2027 goal. No specific milestones or interim targets were established. The target was defined using methodologies aligned with international best practices, namely the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data sources include internal energy consumption reports, contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy and regulatory environmental disclosures. In developing the target EU Green Deal, Paris Agreement, and Romania’s national climate goals were considered. Assumptions include a stable regulatory environment, continued adoption of energy-efficient technologies, and employee engagement in sustainability initiatives. Stakeholders, namely internal specialized teams and operational managers were actively involved in the target-setting process. Employee engagement initiatives, such as awareness campaigns and training sessions, also played a crucial role in shaping the target, ensuring alignment with both business operations and employee expectations. Performance is monitored through the integrated environmental management system, with annual reviews conducted to track emissions, assess trends, and identify areas for further improvement. Key metrics include total CO2 emissions, energy efficiency indicators, and cost savings from energy reduction initiatives. Progress remains on track, with ongoing measures such as remote work policies, energy-efficient infrastructure upgrades, and fleet greening programs supporting continued reductions. Decarbonization levers related to target 2 BRD Group has identified several key decarbonisation levers, described under E1-3 which will contribute to the achievement of its GHG emissions reduction targets for own operations. These levers include: - Energy Efficiency Improvements: The Group is implementing measures to reduce energy consumption across its operations, including the optimization of energy use in office spaces and reducing the energy intensity of production processes. This lever"
"126 will primarily contribute to the reduction of Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased energy). - Fuel Switching: BRD will transition to low-carbon or renew-able fuels in its operations, particularly for any remaining fossil fuel use. The move to electric vehicles (EVs) and the greening of the car fleet by adopting Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) will lower emissions in Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) by replacing traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. - Renewable Energy Adoption: One of the key actions will be to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or green electricity, in its operations, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions. This includes potential on-site renewable energy generation and the purchase of renewable energy. - Operational Optimization: BRD is enhancing operational efficiencies through technology upgrades, such as automation systems, which improve energy management and reduce overall emissions. For GHG emissions Scope 1, the greening of the car fleet (with BEVs/PHEVs) and a reduction in fossil fuel usage across BRD Group’s operations are expected to be the primary decarbonisation measures. Also, switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon or renewable fuels and enhancing energy efficiency in BRD’s building operations will also help reduce direct emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, and green energy) for BRD’s office buildings and operational facilities will reduce Scope 2 emissions. Additionally, energy-efficient equipment and technologies implemented across operations will reduce energy demand, further de-creasing Scope 2 emissions. Use of new technology in achieving target 2 To achieve the GHG emission reduction targets, BRD Group is investing in new technologies that will accelerate decarbonisation, particularly for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Some examples include: - Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure: By adopting BEVs and PHEVs for the company’s car fleet, BRD Group will reduce its Scope 1 emissions. In addition, the Group is investing in charging infrastructure to support these vehicles. - Energy-efficient Technologies: BRD will continue to implement advanced energy- efficient technologies in buildings, such as smart building management systems that optimize energy consumption in real-time. - Data Analytics for Energy Optimization: The use of data analytics tools and IT devices will enhance operational efficiencies and energy management, improving energy use efficiency and reducing carbon intensity. Targets alignment with Paris Agreement objectives BRD Group has established two key targets to address its environmental impact: (1) achieving EUR 2.4 billion in sustainable finance production by 2027, and (2) achieving a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of its own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline. However, it is important to note that these targets are not science-based and have not been explicitly aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The methodology used to determine these targets is primarily based on internal assessments, industry benchmarks and alignment with SG Group ambitions, rather than a sectoral decarbonization pathway. BRD Group’s carbon reduction target for operational emissions is derived from an analysis of its historical emissions, operational energy efficiency initiatives, and anticipated improvements in energy procurement and building infrastructure. The sustainable finance target is based on the SG Group’s strategic"

"Environment E1 Climate Change1 ESRS E1 As an energy-intensive company, we take responsibility for the efficient use of energy and global climate protection, and are committed to the Paris Agreement. We are determined to follow the path toward climate neutrality and to enable our customers’ green transformation by providing low-emission chemistry. ESRS 2 IRO-1 ESRS 2 SBM-3 Our business activities result in the production of greenhouse gas emissions,2 which have a negative impact on the climate. These are emissions from our production, our energy procurement and our upstream and downstream value chain. We are working to achieve a considerable reduction in these emissions along the entire value chain. This also creates opportunities for our business activities: Thanks to our transformation toward climate neutrality, we can increasingly offer our customers products with a reduced Product Carbon Footprint (PCF). Resilience and scenario analyses At the same time, we have to position our business in line with the consequences of climate change and to create resilience. As a company that is active in a very wide variety of different regions and business areas, we take a diversified approach to climate change adaptation. We use our TripleS method (Sustainable Solution Steering, see page 161) to continuously review the resilience of our product portfolio with respect to environmental and social matters. We do this by categorizing our products into different segments. This enables us to quantify and steadily increase the proportion of products that contribute to sustainability. At the same time, products facing substantial regulatory, customer-specific or sustainability challenges are identified and removed from our portfolio within five years. As part of our business strategy development, we also examine the medium- to long-term resilience of our business models from an ecological, economic and social perspective, and with a view to their impacts, risks and opportunities. As regards climate change, this process only looks at transition risks and opportunities – we analyze physical climate risks and existing resilience centrally for our sites (see page 180). In 2024, we started embedding resilience analysis in our processes to a greater extent. The primary focus here is on our own business. The strategies of our business units are updated on a regular basis. This is done either individually at business unit level or as part of the overarching divisional strategy, and involves specialists from the business unit or operating division concerned and from our central strategy unit. In 2024, we piloted a method to address material topics in the strategies of the At a Glance Combined Management’s Report Consolidated Financial Statements Further Information BASF Report 2024 Sustainability Statement 178 1 Unless otherwise stated, all metrics in the text comply with the consolidation by financial control approach (see also the disclosures on consolidation for the nonfinancial reporting on page 151). The metrics listed in this section on the target-relevant Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are part of the statutory audit and have been audited with reasonable assurance. 2 The terms “greenhouse gas emissions” and “CO2 emissions” are used synonymously. They include all greenhouse gases in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol."
"Scope 1 and 2 Based on the 2018 base year, we want to achieve a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from our production processes (Scope 1) and our energy purchases (Scope 2) by 2030.23 Our target focuses on emissions caused by our production and includes 96% of our gross Scope 1 emissions and 99% of our gross Scope 2 emissions. This means that we aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 21.9 million metric tons to 16.4 million metric tons – despite our growth plans and the construction of a new Verbund site in southern China. This corresponds to a decrease of around 60% compared with 1990. Our long-term target is to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.23 We consider future developments in our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in line with the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. When recalculating the emissions from the base year, we have set ourselves a limit of 5% cumulative deviations from the base year. Greenhouse gas emissions of the BASF Group (Scope 1 and 2)a Million metric tons of CO2 equivalents a Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties). The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e). b The figure for 2023 has been adjusted to reflect updated data. In 2024, the BASF Group’s emissions from production and energy purchases23 amounted to 17.0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2023: 17.0 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents24). The slight rise in demand year on year lifted production volumes and thus resulted in higher CO2 emissions. At the same time, we increased the share of electricity from renewable sources compared with the previous year to 26% and, together with measures to increase energy and process efficiency, made a relevant contribution to reducing emissions. All in all, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions in BASF’s operations by 58% since 1990. Scope 3.1 We set ourselves an ambitious Scope 3.1 target25 for our specific raw materials-related emissions in 2023. This includes around 92% of our Scope 3.1 emissions based on the base year. By 2030, we want to reduce these in relation to the purchasing volume specifically by 15% from the 2022 base year. Consequently, we are planning to reduce our specific Scope 3.1 emissions from 1.64 kilograms of CO2 per kilogram of raw materials purchased in the base year 2022 to 1.39 kilograms in the target year 2030.25 Through our commitment, we aim to keep our target-relevant Scope 3.1 emissions roughly At a Glance Combined Management’s Report Consolidated Financial Statements Further Information BASF Report 2024 Sustainability Statement 195 23 Scope 1 and Scope 2 (excluding the sale of energy to third parties). The emissions account for 96% of total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in relation to the base year. The target includes greenhouse gases according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which are converted into CO2 equivalents (CO2e). Scope 2 emissions are calculated using the market-based approach in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Based on the aforementioned emission reduction levers, we assume a reduction in Scope 1 emissions of around 14% between 2018 and 2030. We aim to reduce Scope 2 emissions by around 75% in the same period. The target is aligned with limiting global warming to a global average of 1.5°C, and is thus science-based. It has not been externally audited. 24 The figure for 2023 has been adjusted to reflect updated data. 25 Scope 3.1, gross emissions from raw materials excluding battery materials, excluding services, technical goods and greenhouse gas emissions from BASF trading business. The emissions account for 52% of total Scope 3 emissions based on the 2024 business year. The target is not science-based and has not been externally audited. We adjusted the baseline in line with the TfS Guideline in the reporting year due to the availability of further primary data."
"E2 Pollution Prevention ESRS E2 We work continuously to reduce environmental impacts caused by our business activities. This includes preventing or reducing emissions to air and water, which we achieve first and foremost by operating our plants safely and efficiently. We are also committed to our responsibility for environmental protection throughout the entire value chain in order to reduce the impacts on air and water. In addition, we develop product solutions for our customers that enable them to reduce emissions. ESRS 2 IRO-1 As part of our double materiality assessment conducted in 2024 (see page 167), the topic Environment was identified as material. In particular, the assessment identified emissions to air and water as relevant subtopics for the business activities of BASF. Emissions to air in the form of air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and ammonia, are produced in connection with energy generation and in our production processes. We use water as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent as well as to make our products. We utilize waterways for the purpose of transporting goods. Most of the water used at our production sites is purified and largely reused multiple times, before being discharged as wastewater. Organic substances and heavy metals, for instance, are thus emitted. Our double materiality assessment reveals nine material impacts on the environment and two material risks for BASF (see the table “Results of the double materiality assessment”). Regular emissions to air (excluding greenhouse gases; GHG) in connection with the manufacture of extracted raw materials Negative Upstream value chain (mining/mineral extraction industry) Emissions to air (excluding GHG) contributing to air pollution are generated in connection with the mining and extraction of raw materials in our upstream value chain in the mining and mineral extraction industries.

"E3 Water ESRS E3 Water is of fundamental importance in chemical production along the entire value chain. It is used as a coolant, solvent and cleaning agent, and to make our products. Waterways are used to transport goods. At the same time, water is a scarce commodity in an increasing number of regions. That is why we promote the responsible use of this resource with sustainable water management. Our main business – the development, production and processing of chemicals – as well as the transportation of chemicals requires the responsible use of water as a resource. Firstly, we aim to use water as sparingly and efficiently as possible. Secondly, we want to minimize emissions of potentially harmful substances to water in our production processes and treat wastewater adequately. We address environmental, health and safety risks with a comprehensive Responsible Care Management System (see page 207). ESRS 2 IRO-1 As part of our double materiality assessment conducted in 2024 (see page 167), the topic Water was identified as material. The assessment identified six material impacts on water as a resource and one material risk for BASF (see the table “Results of the double materiality assessment”).

"E4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems ESRS E4 Biodiversity is under threat. It is the foundation for functioning ecosystems. As a chemical company, we use valuable natural resources such as water, air and soil. At the same time, our business activities have an impact on these resources, for example through emissions to the environment or the sourcing of renewable raw materials. ESRS 2 IRO-1 As part of the double materiality assessment that we conducted for 2024 (see page 167), the topic Biodiversity and Ecosystems was defined as material. When performing the assessment, we drew on three sources of information, in particular: – Assessments of various stakeholders and assessments taken from specialist literature – Assessments by BASF experts – Digital sources The digital sources were evaluated using big data and AI analysis tools. We also used platforms such as the Biodiversity Risk Filter (BRF) of the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) and the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 2024, we also discussed our approach to biodiversity in our Nature Advisory Council, a body dedicated to topics related to protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. The Nature Advisory Council supports BASF in obtaining an independent societal perspective on our activities in relation to nature and biodiversity topics. At the end of 2024, the Nature Advisory Council comprised five members from the field of science, relevant value chains and multilateral organizations. Affected communities were not involved in the identification of material topics for the Biodiversity and Ecosystems cluster. ESRS 2 SBM-3 As a chemical company, our business activities interface with nature, and therefore with biodiversity and ecosystems, in three key areas. These are: – Sourcing of raw materials – Operation of production plants – Attributes of our products In order to better categorize and understand the impact of BASF on nature at our production facilities, in their immediate surroundings and throughout the value chain, we use the five drivers of biodiversity loss as defined by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES): Land-use change, pollution, climate change, overexploitation of resources, and invasive species. We also followed this logic in our double materiality assessment (see page 167). As the topic categories Climate Change and Pollution are examined at length in the chapters E1 Climate Change (from page 178 onward) and E2 Pollution Prevention (see page 205 onward), they are not discussed in detail in this chapter. The use of water as a resource is also explored in detail separately (from page 221 onward). We did not examine the driver “invasive species” more closely, as we do not consider it relevant for BASF. Thus, this chapter focuses on the topics surrounding land use and the impacts of our business activities on the land.

"E5 Resource Use and Circular Economy ESRS E5 As the world’s population grows, so does demand for limited natural resources. At the same time, many valuable materials end up in landfill or in waste incineration. Using resources responsibly and closing loops are material for our business and achieving our sustainability targets. In our double materiality assessment, the topic Resource Use and Circular Economy was classified as material. For information on how the assessment was performed – including the tools used to do this – see the chapter General Disclosures, page 167 onward. We have identified five material impacts for BASF as a result of the assessment (see table below). The procurement and use of fossil raw materials negatively impact the environment through emissions, land use and environmental pollution. Waste arising at the end of the functional life of materials that are manufactured using our products may negatively impact the environment on disposal. At the same time, however, this waste also offers a potential opportunity for recycling raw materials and for closing material loops. We systematically record opportunities and risks as part of our general opportunity and risk management (for additional information, see page 87 onward). ESRS 2 IRO-1 To discuss critical issues and, if needed, develop solutions together, we seek dialog with our stakeholders. We are also involved in numerous sustainability initiatives to drive forward sustainability both in general and specifically in relation to our value chain. We are involved in networks, lobbying groups and associations in order to jointly promote sustainability topics. We cooperate with partners along the value chain, for example in the chemical industry’s Together for Sustainability initiative, and are involved in numerous networks such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF), the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), the Global Battery Alliance (GBA) and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW). In doing so, we want to better understand requirements, trends and growth opportunities, and contribute to the development of standards. We use a Group-wide program to assess and develop new projects designed to promote the circular economy. We also address impacts, risks and opportunities by regularly assessing external, independent reports such as the Circularity Gap Report, which is published annually by the Circle Economy Foundation initiative. We have worked together with the WBCSD and other chemical companies to develop a Chemical Transformation Roadmap, which was published on the WBCSD website on October 1, 2024.

"Environmental information (ESRS E1–E5) The following sections cover Zalando’s management practices and performances related to climate change, pollution, water and resource use and circular economy matters. Highsnobiety, due to its distinct business model as a media and curated retail platform, is not covered under the actions and targets further described in the sections below. However, it remains aligned with Zalando’s overall SDI ambition and policies. For more information on Highsnobiety, please refer to our group segments in the section 2.1.2 Group structure of the combined management report. Logistics and non-logistics sites that are under construction throughout the financial year are also omitted from our environmental considerations and calculations.

Material IROs and their interaction with strategy and business model — resilience analysis and climate scenario planning The resilience analysis conducted in June 2022 and updated in 2024 is based on our climate scenario planning, covering both direct and indirect emissions from our own operations (scope 1 and 2) and indirect emissions along the upstream and downstream value chain (scope 3). Risks that met the financial materiality thresholds as a result of the resilience analysis were further embedded into our risk management process. Our full value chain has been included in this analysis: upstream, including design, raw material production, manufacturing processes; own operations, including procurement and buying plus fulfilment; downstream, including transport, product use and end-of-life. The analysis considers material physical risks, including hazards related to temperature, water, wind and soil. Additionally, potential policy and legal developments, technology shifts, market changes and reputational events were assessed to evaluate our exposure to transition risks. For more information, please refer to Impacts, risks and opportunities in section 2.8.1 General information. We assessed the climate resilience of our business by looking at climate-related transition and physical risks and opportunities in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The analysis took into account factors such as the availability of new technologies, regulatory developments, macroeconomic trends, customer expectations and the broader business environment, including competitor actions. We used two different global GHG emissions pathways for the scenario analysis. In particular, we considered the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) AR5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 scenario, which assumes an increase in global temperatures to 1.5°C, and the AR5 IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario, with an increase of 4°C. The scenarios consider temperature, precipitation and the number of hot days. These scenarios were adapted to local conditions, and potential impacts on retail companies were assessed across three time frames: by 2025 (short-term), by 2030 (medium-term) and by 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 201 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"ESRS E2 Pollution Identification and assessment of material pollution-related IROs We have identified five significant environmental impacts and associated human health concerns related to pollution. These impacts are as follows: — Water pollution: arising from the material processing phase, particularly during dyeing, and involving the use of water and chemicals. — Microplastic release: synthetic fibres contribute to the release of microplastics during washing cycles, posing risks to aquatic ecosystems and human health. — Air pollution: caused by fragmented value chains that depend on long-distance transportation, leading to increased emissions. — Soil pollution: resulting from the use of pesticides and fertilisers in the conventional farming of natural fibres, which contaminate both soil and water sources. — Chemical pollution: processes such as bleaching, printing and finishing often involve harmful chemicals that, if not properly managed, can be released into the environment. The material environmental impacts resulting from the DMA occur during the production and distribution stages, including raw material extraction, textile production and transportation. These stages are outside our direct operations. Within our own operations, emissions are comparatively non-significant. For example, non-carbon emissions to air of our fulfilment centres are significantly lower than the emissions generated by the manufacturing processes. Similarly, microplastics potentially generated from our operations, if present, are minimal compared to the microplastics generated during the use phase of a fashion product over its life span. We did not screen site locations for pollution-related IROs, as none of the sites under our operation and control have emission sources that require reporting according to Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register, E-PRTR Regulation). Affected communities along the value chain were not directly consulted during the DMA. For further information on stakeholder engagement in our DMA, please refer to Impacts, risks and opportunities in section 2.8.1 General information. For these reasons, our disclosures on pollution focus on our policies and actions related to chemical management. Accordingly, we have not yet established any group-wide policies, actions or targets in relation to pollution of air, water, soil and microplastics in line with the ESRS. Reporting on pollution metrics (disclosure requirements ESRS E2-4 and E2-5) for our own operations is not included as it is considered not material to Zalando according to our DMA. Policies related to pollution To manage upstream and downstream impacts and comply with regulations, we have developed a chemical management system. This includes the Restricted Substances List (RSL) to determine chemical requirements and limits for harmful substances in products. For private labels, the Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) restricts chemicals in production, aligned with Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals standards. For more information on our chemical management system and the processes for remediating negative impacts, please refer to ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users: personal safety in section 2.8.3.

"Actions and resources related to pollution At Zalando, we monitor the effectiveness of our MRSL and RSL through a risk-based due diligence programme. Our Quality Assurance team conducts regular testing of products and materials throughout the production cycle, from raw materials to finished goods, utilising accredited third-party laboratories. For more information on our quality checks on products and materials, please refer to ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users - Actions related to personal safety in section 2.8.3. Social information. Targets related to pollution We aim to ensure alignment with the existing regulatory framework. Our pollution-related commitments focus on preventing harmful substances in products by adhering to regulatory thresholds. For more information, please refer to ESRS S4 Consumers and end-users - Targets related to personal safety in section 2.8.3. Social information. ESRS E3 Water resources Identification and assessment of material water-related IROs Our business depends on continued access to water, and we are already witnessing the effects of water scarcity and water quality risks in our activities. Previously assessed climate- related risks and opportunities described in the Resilience analysis and climate scenario planning in section ESRS E1 Climate change have informed our DMA. Our climate resilience analysis contributes to identifying water-related risks linked to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, such as flooding or droughts, along our value chain and in our own operations. Key risks carried into our DMA include reputational risks from water consumption in our value chain, business continuity risks from water scarcity affecting raw material availability and human health impacts from reduced water security. Opportunities centre on the potential to enable collective action on water stewardship. No IROs related to marine resources were identified as our business does not rely on marine resources. We have not screened our assets and activities to identify the IROs. However, in 2024 we undertook an assessment of water risk areas related to our own operations. This assessment specifically focuses on our direct impact on water consumption in these water risk regions, with further details provided in the following section. In 2024, we conducted a water risk assessment for our private labels for major Tier 2 (wet processing) facilities, and going forward we aim to pay particular attention to our private labels’ water impact, particularly in high water stress areas. Direct consultations with affected communities have not been conducted. Policies related to water We established our water management policy in 2024, reflecting our ambition to addressing the critical water challenges associated with our own operations and value chain. This policy sets the foundation for managing water consumption and pollution and for managing water- related risks. We are dedicated to continuously expanding and refining our water management approach in the future in alignment with industry best practices and stakeholder expectations. Water management is critical for the resilience of our business operations and value chain. The aim of our water management policy is to minimise our water consumption and water pollution, comply with regulatory requirements and ensure the responsible use of water resources across our own operations and value chain. 1 Company 2 Combined management report 3 Consolidated financial statements 4 Other information and service 218 Zalando SE ANNUAL REPORT 2024"
"Change in water stored: This represents the year-on-year difference in the volume of water stored at our logistics and non-logistics facilities. Since 2024 is the first year of measurement, the first available value will be reported in the 2025 financial year. Water intensity: The water intensity ratio is calculated by dividing the total water consumption for our own operations by the net revenue of Zalando. Our water intensity is 2.2 m 3/m EUR. This relatively low value for the water intensity metric reflects the limited water consumption in our direct operations. Within our own operations, we do not engage in water-intensive activities as our core processes, e.g. warehousing, office and showrooms, have a relatively low water usage. We acknowledge that our more significant water impacts lie within our upstream value chain, particularly in raw material extraction, product manufacturing, and downstream activities related to product use. ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Identification and assessment of material resource use and circular economy-related IROs To identify the environmental impact potential related to the circular economy, we conducted life cycle assessments (LCAs) in 2022 and updated them in 2024 during the DMA. They encompassed different circular business models such as pre-owned, take-back, care and repair, and reusable packaging. The LCA results highlighted that raw material extraction and processing were the most significant environmental impact areas of a product’s life cycle. These outcomes informed our DMA, completed in 2024, and our new circularity policy. Regarding the use of materials, we depend heavily on cotton, polyester and leather as key materials for the majority of products offered by our private label business and brand partners. By embedding more sustainable practices across our value chain — from product sourcing and design to logistics and recommerce — we ensure that we remain resilient in the face of emerging environmental challenges, while contributing to the creation of long-term value for our stakeholders. We have outlined the specific business units responsible for managing IROs related to our resource use and circular economy initiatives below. The SDI team includes resources dedicated to the oversight of the comprehensive assessment of IROs related to resource use and the circular economy. This team sets our strategic direction for transitioning to a circular economy by developing strategic initiatives and partnerships that accelerate circular innovation. Policies related to resource use and circular economy Our circularity policy provides an overarching strategic framework for driving progress in the circular economy to manage our material IROs. The policy focuses on three foundational pillars: i) Circular products, ii) Circular business models and iii) End-of-life, broadly covering our business activities. We are committed to fostering innovation by continuing our efforts to support and scale up initiatives, building on strategic investments in textile-to-textile recyclers to date.

"4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place. (1) European standard 12056-1 defines grey water as wastewater with a low level of pollution, such as that produced by showers, baths, washbasins and washing machines, which can be recycled as non-potable cold water.

A dedicated water policy is expected to be defined before the end of 2026. It will be built in line with the biodiversity strategy that the Group undertakes to adopt in 2025. The Group has already implemented practices intended to reduce the potential negative impact of its financing on water resources, in particular via support mechanisms for its customers that take into account these challenges. These practices are also addressed in ESRS E4, as the pressure exerted by human activities on water resources is one of the five pressures responsible for biodiversity loss (IPBES report). Although this is not a material issue for the Group, it has also implemented sustainable practices concerning the oceans and seas, as detailed in ESRS E4, in relation to the pressures exerted on marine ecosystems. There are many water management issues that economic players will have to face in the coming years. As part of its future reflections on this issue, the Group will ensure that it supports its customers in their transition, in particular by offering dedicated support services. The opportunities offered by the development of new practices to preserve water resources are particularly relevant to the issue of adapting to climate change, which is a priority area of work for the Group in relation to ESRS E1. In view of its activities, the Crédit Mutuel Arkéa Group is not subject to any regulatory requirement to set water resource targets. Nevertheless, it will examine this possibility when defining its future policy. As part of this, the Group will draw on existing work such as the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge. The Group has not yet assessed the expected financial impact of its significant impacts, risks and opportunities related to water resources. Environmental risk management policy and water-related initiatives The environmental risk management policy (presented in ESRS E1, section 4.2.2.3 Focus on taking climate risks into account) includes a system for identifying and assessing the materiality of risks relating to water resources. The latter is based on the analysis of water-related impacts and dependencies (ENCORE database) (water quality, water consumption, etc.) to assess the risks associated with water and marine resources. As mentioned in ESRS E4, Crédit Mutuel Arkéa deploys an internal ESG risk rating system. The questionnaire includes questions on water resource management, including the implementation of policies, actions and targets in this area and the level of water consumption, in order to assess the level of risk. The practices deployed by the Group to reduce pressure on water abstraction and consumption and to improve the distribution of water by institutions In view of the potentially negative impact of the players it finances on water resources, the Group has introduced loan schemes at rates that encourage customers to change their practices. The Group offers a range of loans at subsidised interest rates to finance projects linked to water resources: ■the local banks that are members of the Crédit Mutuel de Bretagne federation offer solutions dedicated to corporate customers: - the Pronovéo loan can be used to finance practices aimed at reducing water consumption, such as installing rainwater collection tanks and recycling grey water(1); - the Agrinovéo loan, used to finance projects to recover rainwater and recycle grey water. ■the Arkéa Impulse loan from Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels incorporates objectives and criteria for awarding the loan subsidy aimed at: - reducing customers' water consumption in their production processes; - developing wastewater treatment and treatment capacity; - improving the resilience and efficiency of public water services. In addition, Arkéa Banque Entreprises et Institutionnels includes an analysis of extra-financial criteria related to water consumption in the study of financing requests from players in the food and pharmaceutical industries in order to gain a better understanding of their practices. 4.2.4.3 Water consumption at Group sites The Group monitors water consumption at its operating sites. In a tertiary activity, water consumption is essentially linked to individual use by employees. This monitoring shows that the consumption resulting from its sites is marginal, particularly in view of its indirect impacts linked to the financing of certain sectors (such as construction), real estate, agriculture and hospitality). As result, the Group's own sites have no material impact on or dependence on water resources. The Group has sites located in high water stress zones(2) and extremely high water stress zones. However, given the low impact of these sites on water resources, no dedicated policy has been put in place. (1) European standard 12056-1 defines grey water as wastewater with a low level of pollution, such as that produced by showers, baths, washbasins and washing machines, which can be recycled as non-potable cold water.
