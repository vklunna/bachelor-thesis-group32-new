"Policies, actions and performance With our sector transition plan we focus on the most carbon-intensive sectors and steering them towards net zero, as described in the previous section. As a bank, we have more measures in place to manage our impacts, risks and opportunities. These actions are not part of our sector transition plan, but do present our strategic direction and are an integral part of how we do and manage our business. This next section includes the relevant policies and guidelines to address the material impacts, risks and opportunities and the related actions to execute those policies and guidelines. Where the Environmental, Social and Governance Risk Policy addresses our negative impacts and risks, our sustainable finance guidelines and green bond framework address our opportunities. The Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Risk Policy The ESG Risk Framework, as further described in the 'ESG risk’ section, outlines ING’s approach to managing ESG risk as a risk driver of existing risk types. The framework is supported by the double materiality assessment (DMA1) and the ESG Risk Policy, ensuring the implementation of obligations, processes and control requirements from the policy. The ESG Risk Policy outlines ING’s approach to effectively identify, assess, mitigate, monitor and report ESG related risks as per ING’s ESG risk appetite, by considering applicable and material risks and negative impacts across the value chain as per ING’s DMA. The policy is applicable to ING Groep N.V. and all majority-owned and/or controlled ING entities, unless deviation is allowed by pursuant to local laws, regulations and/or supervisory acts. Relevant legislation and supervisory guidance on risk management practices, as well as ESG-related disclosures including the EBA Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Pillar 3 disclosures on ESG risk, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities, and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) are taken into account when drafting the policy. The ESG Risk Policy outlines its objectives and purpose, referencing relevant laws, regulations and global documentation. It also details the high-level obligations for entities, including control objectives to manage and mitigate ESG risks. The obligations are provided for applicable value-chain components. The ESG Risk Department, as the policy owner, performs oversight and monitoring of the policy implementation to obtain sufficient comfort of compliance with policy obligations across ING. ESG risks are an overarching set of risk drivers affecting financial, non-financial, and other overarching risks. Consequently, ESG risk management is embedded within existing risk processes and procedures related to credit granting criteria, risk appetite steering, and credit risk management. ING local entities integrate global requirements into local policy annexes, taking into account specifics of local regulations and market practices. Mostly such adjustments are done through lending criteria, local systems of loan management, systems of records and sales force procedures. Actions to implement the ESG Risk Policy As part of the risk management cycle (see the ‘ESG risk section’), ING takes a proactive approach to mitigating identified risks in line with its risk appetite. This is achieved through various risk mitigation strategies, such as reducing, avoiding, accepting, or transferring the risk. These measures are embedded in updates to existing policies and procedures across different risk categories. In the following paragraphs we elaborate on the key initiatives for each of the business lines where climate change has been identified as a material risk. Retail Banking: Residential mortgages ING regularly analyses different transmission channels and takes actions to manage associated risks. Transition and physical risks for the mortgage portfolio have been incorporated into ING’s business strategy, data controls, risk appetite, lending criteria and collateral valuation processes for local retail entities. Each local entity implements the ESG Risk Policy via the global guidance on material identified topics. Local adaptations are made in line with local regulations and market practices (reference: Organisational bodies, ‘ESG risk’ section). • Some local entities have already implemented policies to increase financing amounts and reduce pricing for properties with high-quality EPCs. Additionally, customer-engagement procedures, supported by advisory services and duty of care, aim at shifting customer interest towards low-emitting buildings. • One of the most crucial actions ING took to achieve more accurate emissions-based target setting and to better understand the effectiveness of its business strategy was implementing a set of mandatory data controls. For new originations, ING local entities implemented controls to ensure the mandatory collection of EPC data. Additionally, for the existing portfolio, controls on the development of energy performance proxy models facilitated high-quality data remediation. • Risk appetite is aligned with the business strategy and includes specific metrics for managing low-quality EPCs at new origination. Breaches in risk appetite are managed within the Risk Appetite Framework, with timely escalation to the ESG Risk Committee and top management. • The incorporation of climate-related risks into lending criteria is aligned with our risk appetite and business strategy. • Transition and physical risks are incorporated into collateral valuation through external valuers or by internally managing collateral haircuts and loan-to-value limitations for high-emitting properties.

Important ESG factors are determined on a case by case basis and considers international standards such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on responsible business conduct and the UNGPs on Business and Human Rights"
"Biodiversity and ecosystems Biodiversity is the variety of and interaction between all living things (red. species) which work together in ecosystems to maintain, balance and support life. It supports in nature all we need to survive, but since we put increasing pressure on the earth by using and consuming more natural resources, we are upsetting the balance of ecosystems, leading to the loss of biodiversity. Identified impacts, risks and opportunities Our double materiality assessment concluded the below negative impact and risk for ‘state of species’ within biodiversity and ecosystems as material for our Wholesale Banking portfolio: • Negative impact on the state of species occurs due to lending to clients whose operations cause irreversible damage, such as some species disappearing entirely and others undergoing significant changes in behaviour, genetic variability, distribution, and population dynamics. • Risks can materialise following the severity of a negative impact and varies across sectors. This can result in a demise in natural resources, and can disrupt clients’ operations, leading to financial losses. Financial losses can also occur due to reputational damage and litigation risks. This section only focuses on the ‘state of species’ as per our DMA outcome. The identified negative impact for state of species is driven by our portfolio composition in the downstream value chain and the irremediable nature of the negative effects. By financing these downstream activities, we contribute to a cumulative impact on species that goes beyond the initial stages of resource extraction, land use changes, overexploitation of natural resources, increased emissions, and waste (i.e. the drivers of biodiversity loss). The cumulative impact refers to the ongoing and interconnected effects that unfold over time, leading to a significant and often irreversible decline in biodiversity and ecosystem health. Some impacts, such as species extinction, are permanent. Once a species is lost, it cannot be brought back, leading to a permanent reduction in biodiversity. In addition, a significant loss in genetic variability or niche habitat also makes it immensely difficult to bring back a species to a safe state without the risk of extinction. The impact on the state of species by different activities has very different time horizons from short- to long-term. A sudden decline in species can, for example, be caused by a spill of dangerous substances, immediately killing surrounding life. Habitat fragmentation leads to a medium-term decline of the number of species and genetic variability within a species. Climate change can lead to the extinction of species and disrupt ecosystems over decades. See the ‘Technical notes to the double materiality assessment’ for more details on the approach. There is currently still a lack of well-established and scenario-based quantification methods when it comes to the topic of biodiversity and ecosystems, and nature more broadly. However, this field is rapidly developing and is looking at both transition risks, such as nature-related policy and technology changes, as well as physical risks caused by ecosystem losses and climate–nature interactions in order to integrate them into stress testing and modelling. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of global GDP depends on biodiversity, which includes the state of species. As our portfolio reflects the real economy, we expect it to have a similar dependency.1 Assessment of current financial effects is based on ING’s internal risk database. We rely on the existing approach based on the recognition and measurement criteria of provisions in the Financial Statements, for more information see Note 15 'Provisions' and Note 41 'Legal proceedings'. For 2024, there were no significant current financial effects. At this stage, we are not able to provide a more quantitative or qualitative resilience analysis or more specific time horizons. As our business is diverse and distributed across the globe, we do not consider the opinion of location-based stakeholders into our general resilience analysis; these are considered on a transaction level. Before financing specific large-scale projects, we do consider the resilience of our clients’ businesses to local biodiversity-related transition and physical risks, including those with impacts on the local population. In environmental and social management assessments, local stakeholders give key inputs into the outcome of the analysis according to the Equator Principles. For the mid- and long-term horizons, we depend on customer engagement and the ability of our borrowers to understand possible implications of biodiversity loss on their business. ING is currently developing such expertise and so are our borrowers. We are also expecting increasing regulatory pressure from the implementation of the Global Biodiversity Framework, as well as EU-led initiatives to reduce pollution, production and use of plastics and water, and increased concern about species and protected habitats. Our nature strategy The overarching ambition of our nature strategy2 is to empower our clients to contribute to halting and reversing nature loss and support the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF). Our nature approach, available on ing.com, addresses all the main drivers of nature loss that are inextricably linked to the state of species3. While these drivers are not material for our portfolio, they are relevant for the assessment of all transactions. We are currently developing a transition plan that should become operational in the coming years, building on the structure and experience of our Terra approach for climate, enabling us to engage our clients on relevant environmental topics.

"whole, this is relevant for our material sub-topic, state of species. The below visual illustrates our current strategic approach towards nature. Policies, actions and performance As a financial institution, we can make the largest impact through our financing activities. Therefore, we have policies and guidelines in place to manage nature-related risks and impacts. ESG Risk Policy ING’s strategic objectives of managing nature-related risks and impacts are being implemented by the ESG Risk Policy. The ESG Risk Policy is a comprehensive environmental and social risk policy that evaluates material environmental risk factors in relation to our financing. This entails the evaluation of the direct drivers of biodiversity loss, climate change, land-use, sea-use or freshwater use change, pollution and the exploitation of natural resources, as well as the extent to which the company’s operations and products/ services likely impact the state of species and habitats, and the extent and condition of ecosystems, given its sector. It further assesses the extent to which the company is likely dependent on ecosystem services for its operations, products and services, given its sector. The ESG Risk Policy addresses our negative impact on the state of species, our dependencies on species and ecosystems, and our risk related to that. Our risk is lower if we finance fewer transactions that are harmful to the state of species, or support our clients in reducing their impact by implementing minimum requirements and encouraging them to improve. The ESG Risk Policy contains several biodiversity and ecosystem-specific requirements for our financing activities with the aim of avoiding further habitat destruction and species loss. These include, but are not limited to: • We will not finance any operations located in, or that significantly impact, based on experts’ assessments, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, wetlands registered by the Ramsar Convention, or critical natural habitats registered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Category I and II. • We will not finance operations or any newly developed asset that involves illegal logging, deforestation or burning down of tropical forests, or removal of primary or High Conservation (HCV) forests. • We conduct enhanced due diligence before financing projects requiring significant land-use change, and for operations impacting IUCN Category III and IV sites or potentially vulnerable ecosystems including ‘Key Biodiversity Areas’. These are home to critical populations of the world’s threatened species. Furthermore, we have sector-specific minimum standards that aim at minimising impacts within the industry. They especially target the industry sectors chemicals, bioenergy, forestry & agricultural commodities, manufacturing, metals & mining, and shipping. Examples of restrictions to the most harmful practices within sectors with a high risk of impacting the state of species are: • ING has no intention of expanding its palm oil client base. For existing clients, ING performs strict assessment criteria that are closely monitored; • ING will not directly finance artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) companies or activities; • Use of endangered species or non-human primates for all testing/experimental purposes; and • Arctic offshore oil & gas exploration and production. Specific requirements under the ESG Risk Policy support the traceability of products, components and raw materials. For example, ING requires all relevant clients to adopt the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) schemes or the programme for the endorsement of forest certification schemes. This includes wood plantations, traders, pulp producers, and secondary processors. ING also requires production, sourcing and consumption from ecosystems to limit the impact on species. For example, we expect that our clients producing biofuels or involved in the value chain to understand and assess the climate-related, environmental and social risks related to their biofuels business, and manage and mitigate these risks Contents ING at a glance Strategy, business model and value creation Our financial performance Our leadership and corporate governance Sustainability Statement Capital management Risk management Consolidated financial statements Parent company financial statements Other information and appendices > Environment ING Group Annual Report 2024 131"
