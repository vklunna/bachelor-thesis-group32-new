"105 8.2. Environmental Information Climate Change This chapter includes details on the identified impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) related to climate change, as well as the corresponding policies, actions and targets. Furthermore, BRD Group’s overview on the policies, measures and targets is also presented. Strategy E1-1-17 Transition Plan BRD Group acknowledges the importance of having a transition plan to align with climate goals and support the sustainability transition. While BRD Group does not currently have a formal transition plan in place, it is committed to developing and adopting one within its report for 2027. This timeline reflects the complexity and scope of the transition process, ensuring that the plan will be comprehensive, actionable and aligned with both regulatory requirements and the broader strategic objectives of SG. BRD Group is closely aligning its sustainability initiatives with the overarching strategy of SG. SG has established sustainability goals/targets aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and BRD Group is working to ensure compliance with SG’s commitments, including the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) targets and sector-specific decarbonization pathways. Developing a transition plan that is fully integrated into the Group’s sustainability objectives requires time and coordination. Moreover, the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly under CSRD, requires BRD Group to carefully assess its reporting obligations and integrate sustainability considerations across all business areas. The development of a transition plan is being approached with diligence to meet these evolving requirements effectively. BRD Group is not excluded from the Paris Agreement Benchmarks. Although a formal transition plan is not yet available, BRD Group is actively engaged in sustainability initiatives that contribute to the transition process. These include: - Supporting corporate clients in their sustainability transition through financing solutions such as Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs) and Project Investment Financing (SPIF), focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. - Expanding green financing for retail clients by offering green loans under EU Invest sustainability support schemes and collaborating with energy efficiency solution providers. - Increasing the share of green financing in BRD Sogelease to support industries such as transport decarbonization and circular economy transitions. - Partnering with institutions such as IFC, EIB (through EIF), and EU funds programs to implement sustainability-linked projects. BRD Group is conducting internal assessments and stakeholder engagements to evaluate the readiness of its portfolios for transition. This includes:"

"123 prioritize financing in sustainable sectors while avoiding environmentally harmful industries. Furthermore, the target contributes to SG’s Climate Policy, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy by financing green projects and reducing exposure to carbon- intensive sectors. It is also in line with the SG Positive Impact Financing Bond Framework, which promotes investments in projects that generate positive environmental and social impacts, such as renewable energy and social inclusion, while ensuring transparent reporting and accountability. The target is also used to track the effectiveness of the “Business plan for sustainable and positive impact financing” disclosed under “Actions Related to Climate Change Adaptation, Climate Change Mitigation and Energy”. This target addresses all climate change mitigation adaptation and energy material impacts, risks and opportunities, apart from the negative impacts related to carbon emissions and the use of non-renewable energy, addressed by Target 2, described below. The target applies to all BRD activities related to sustainable finance, including corporate lending, retail banking. It covers financing activities across downstream value chains, addressing direct clients and potential clients. The geographical scope includes BRD’s operational regions, primarily Romania, with potential contributions from SG Group initiatives across the broader European market. Upstream value chain does not fall under the scope of this target. The target applies to the period 2023-2027, with regular interim milestones to monitor progress. Annual reviews are conducted to ensure alignment with BRD Group's sustainability goals and regulatory expectations, with interim targets set for each year to ensure a steady trajectory towards the 2027 goal. The target is defined using methodologies aligned with international sustainability frameworks and SG/BRD Group’s sustainability strategies. Significant assumptions include the continued availability, stable economic conditions, and increasing client demand for sustainable financial products. Data sources include internal financial reporting systems, regulatory disclosures, and third-party verification mechanisms to ensure accuracy for certain categories (SLL financing). Key stakeholders, including clients, investors, regulatory bodies, and internal sustainability committees, have been actively involved in defining the target. Stakeholder engagement includes consultations with industry experts, partnerships with environmental organizations, and dialogue with policymakers to ensure the target aligns with market needs and regulatory frameworks. Progress towards the sustainable finance target is monitored and reviewed regularly through internal governance structures, in the quarterly monitoring of business strategy and financial reporting systems. Metrics used to track progress include the total volume of sustainable financing, progress towards the established targets, trends of evolution compared to the target. In addition, on an annual basis, we assess the trend of the sustainable finance market. Performance is assessed through quarterly and annual reviews, ensuring that progress remains in line with initial projections and allowing for corrective actions if necessary. This is a quantitative indicator, and no explicit qualitative data is used to monitor progress. Target 2"
"124 Achieve a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline. The target was established in alignment with BRD Group’s strategic vision outlined in the Horizons 2027 strategy, ensuring a cohesive approach to our objectives. It does not however address the policies disclosed in this report. We note that the methodology used to calculate the baseline value for the reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations was internally developed and refers to categories of emissions associated with Scope 1, 2 and selected categories in scope 3, as described above. The target set by us of reduction with 55% of the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027 is set in accordance with the above mentioned methodology. Our goal is to achieve this current target by 2027 and set a new GHG reduction target as part of our future Transition Plan. However, the methodology disclosed in section ""Metrics related to climate change"" as well as the actual values for GHG emissions under Scope 1, 2 and selected categories from scope 3 is different from the methodology used to determine the baseline value for carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations. The defined target is to achieve a 55% absolute reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline of 20,071 tons of CO2 (tCO2). The target is expressed in absolute terms, measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). The target covers BRD Group’s direct operations, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions across all office buildings, branches, data centres, and operational facilities within Romania. It does not currently extend to upstream or down-stream value chains but focuses on emissions under the Group’s direct control, ensuring a significant impact within BRD Group’s geographical operations. BRD Group ensures the consistency of its GHG reduction targets with its GHG inventory boundaries by aligning its emissions accounting and reduction initiatives with internationally recognized standards and frameworks, including the GHG Protocol. The defined target of a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline, covers the same organizational and operational boundaries used in the annual GHG inventory assessment. The GHG inventory encompasses Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, covering direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., company vehicles, heating systems) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, and cooling. Additionally, relevant Scope 3 emissions, namely employee commuting and business travel, are monitored to assess their impact and identify potential reduction opportunities. This approach ensures that BRD Group’s emissions reduction initiatives cover and address all significant sources of operational carbon emissions. BRD Group's integrated environmental management system enables accurate data collection, validation, and reporting across all relevant operational sites. Yearly external audits and reviews are conducted to validate the consistency between the defined GHG targets and the inventory boundaries, ensuring that any adjustments or operational changes (such as new office locations, fleet modifications, or energy procurement strategies) are reflected in both the target and the inventory."
"125 BRD Group has established 2019 as the base year for its GHG emissions reduction target, with a baseline value of 20,071 tCO2 from its own operations. This baseline was determined through a comprehensive assessment of emissions data collected across all operational sites, covering both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and selected Scope 3 categories. The 2019 baseline serves as a reference point for measuring progress and tracking the effectiveness of BRD's emissions reduction initiatives. BRD Group has selected 2019 as the baseline year for its GHG emissions reduction target due to its operational stability and typical consumption levels. While 2020 was a potential candidate for the baseline, it was excluded due to the significant disruption caused by the COVID- 19 pan-demic, which led to abnormal consumption patterns and a reduction in overall operational activity. This drastic reduction in emissions and energy use in 2020 could have negatively influenced the data, making it an unreliable reference for normal operations. To ensure that the baseline is representative of typical activity levels, 2019 was chosen as it reflects a year of normal operational performance without the external disruptions that occurred in 2020. This baseline value was reviewed to ensure that it reflects BRD Group's operational emissions prior to any significant external factors or anomalies. An intensity value GHG reduction target is not yet established. The target period spans from 2019 to 2027. In 2024 it was achieved a reduction of 45% compared to the 2019 baseline. Further reviews and adjustments are planned annually to ensure the Group remains on track to achieve its final 2027 goal. No specific milestones or interim targets were established. The target was defined using methodologies aligned with international best practices, namely the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data sources include internal energy consumption reports, contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy and regulatory environmental disclosures. In developing the target EU Green Deal, Paris Agreement, and Romania’s national climate goals were considered. Assumptions include a stable regulatory environment, continued adoption of energy-efficient technologies, and employee engagement in sustainability initiatives. Stakeholders, namely internal specialized teams and operational managers were actively involved in the target-setting process. Employee engagement initiatives, such as awareness campaigns and training sessions, also played a crucial role in shaping the target, ensuring alignment with both business operations and employee expectations. Performance is monitored through the integrated environmental management system, with annual reviews conducted to track emissions, assess trends, and identify areas for further improvement. Key metrics include total CO2 emissions, energy efficiency indicators, and cost savings from energy reduction initiatives. Progress remains on track, with ongoing measures such as remote work policies, energy-efficient infrastructure upgrades, and fleet greening programs supporting continued reductions. Decarbonization levers related to target 2 BRD Group has identified several key decarbonisation levers, described under E1-3 which will contribute to the achievement of its GHG emissions reduction targets for own operations. These levers include: - Energy Efficiency Improvements: The Group is implementing measures to reduce energy consumption across its operations, including the optimization of energy use in office spaces and reducing the energy intensity of production processes. This lever"
"126 will primarily contribute to the reduction of Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased energy). - Fuel Switching: BRD will transition to low-carbon or renew-able fuels in its operations, particularly for any remaining fossil fuel use. The move to electric vehicles (EVs) and the greening of the car fleet by adopting Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) will lower emissions in Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) by replacing traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. - Renewable Energy Adoption: One of the key actions will be to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or green electricity, in its operations, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions. This includes potential on-site renewable energy generation and the purchase of renewable energy. - Operational Optimization: BRD is enhancing operational efficiencies through technology upgrades, such as automation systems, which improve energy management and reduce overall emissions. For GHG emissions Scope 1, the greening of the car fleet (with BEVs/PHEVs) and a reduction in fossil fuel usage across BRD Group’s operations are expected to be the primary decarbonisation measures. Also, switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon or renewable fuels and enhancing energy efficiency in BRD’s building operations will also help reduce direct emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, and green energy) for BRD’s office buildings and operational facilities will reduce Scope 2 emissions. Additionally, energy-efficient equipment and technologies implemented across operations will reduce energy demand, further de-creasing Scope 2 emissions. Use of new technology in achieving target 2 To achieve the GHG emission reduction targets, BRD Group is investing in new technologies that will accelerate decarbonisation, particularly for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Some examples include: - Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure: By adopting BEVs and PHEVs for the company’s car fleet, BRD Group will reduce its Scope 1 emissions. In addition, the Group is investing in charging infrastructure to support these vehicles. - Energy-efficient Technologies: BRD will continue to implement advanced energy- efficient technologies in buildings, such as smart building management systems that optimize energy consumption in real-time. - Data Analytics for Energy Optimization: The use of data analytics tools and IT devices will enhance operational efficiencies and energy management, improving energy use efficiency and reducing carbon intensity. Targets alignment with Paris Agreement objectives BRD Group has established two key targets to address its environmental impact: (1) achieving EUR 2.4 billion in sustainable finance production by 2027, and (2) achieving a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of its own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline. However, it is important to note that these targets are not science-based and have not been explicitly aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The methodology used to determine these targets is primarily based on internal assessments, industry benchmarks and alignment with SG Group ambitions, rather than a sectoral decarbonization pathway. BRD Group’s carbon reduction target for operational emissions is derived from an analysis of its historical emissions, operational energy efficiency initiatives, and anticipated improvements in energy procurement and building infrastructure. The sustainable finance target is based on the SG Group’s strategic"
