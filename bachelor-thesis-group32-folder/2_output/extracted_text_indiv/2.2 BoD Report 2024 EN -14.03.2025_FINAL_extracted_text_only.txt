Long-term Financial Effects: In the long term, BRD Group anticipates a good financial performance driven by the successful integration of sustainability principles into its core business model. BRD Group expects to benefit from regulatory stability, reduced risk exposure and long-term relationships with clients adopting green business models. Capital expenditures in digitalization and sustainable finance solutions will support revenue growth and operational efficiency. Furthermore, BRD Group's strategic focus on financial inclusion and access to essential services, such as healthcare and housing, will expand its market reach and drive long-term profitability. The transition to a greener economy is expected to provide resilience against economic downturns and climate-related financial risks. To support its sustainability strategy, BRD Group plans to allocate capital towards: ● Expanding its portfolio of sustainable finance, including green loans and ESG- compliant financial products26. ● Upgrading its physical infrastructure to meet energy efficiency targets. ● Investing in digitalization to enhance transparency and accessibility of financial services. To implement its strategic initiatives, BRD Group plans to secure funding through: ● Continuous focus on stable retail deposits. ● Retained earnings reinvestment to support sustainable growth initiatives. ● Strategic partnerships with development banks and international financial institutions. ● Accessing Government programs and incentives related to climate action and energy efficiency. Resilience of the Strategy BRD Group, in collaboration with SG, monitors the resilience of its strategy and business model to material impacts and risks and how to capitalize on material opportunities. Central to the monitoring process is undertaking a ""Business Environment Scan"" (BES), which has been conducted on an annual basis since 2022. The annual BES is undertaken to enable Management to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the material Climate and Environmental (C&E) risks that may impact the organization over a range of time horizons from the short- to long-term. The BES process helps BRD Group identify: • Threats to the business model that arise from Climate Change and Environmental risks. • Business opportunities from the economic transformation, client transitions, and adaptive measures to mitigate climate - related physical risks. BRD Group undertakes the BES to obtain a high-level understanding of vulnerabilities, potential threats, and opportunities that may impact its business over the short- to long- term time horizons. Using these insights, BRD Group then undertakes further analysis 26 ESG financial product, namely a product designed in accordance with ESG Regulatory requirements and BRD Group’s commitments"
"104 as needed, such as with the risk materiality assessment in order to obtain more granular data and in-depth understanding of its material impacts risks and opportunities. As part of BES, BRD Group analyses a wide range of sources of evidence including global geo-political and macro-trends, existent and upcoming regulatory requirements, stakeholder feedback and peer analysis. BRD Group also considers the impacts to its business from physical events, driven by climate and other environmental change. By monitoring and assessing a range of evidence in these areas, BRD Group can take informed decisions and strategic action to support it moving towards becoming a net- zero organization. The outcomes of BES provide BRD Group with detailed information that help it decide where further analysis is required or should be prioritized. For example: • Identified threats (if deemed relevant) are further evaluated in the risk materiality assessment. • Identified opportunities (if deemed relevant) are considered in business strategy and business planning. These outcomes help inform the BRD Group’s strategy and its decarbonization process. The BES is conducted across all BRD Group’s operations which help provide insights across geographies, sectors and products that the Group should prioritize for action. For example, following its most recent BES in 2024, BRD Group created an action plan that it has already started to implement, such as taking actions to start exiting from highly polluting businesses and shifting financing towards green and sustainable activities for Corporates. Future initiatives are under discussion at BRD Group level, to prioritize other actions on short, medium and long term, based on the elements revealed by the Climate and Environmental analysis."
"105 8.2. Environmental Information Climate Change This chapter includes details on the identified impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) related to climate change, as well as the corresponding policies, actions and targets. Furthermore, BRD Group’s overview on the policies, measures and targets is also presented. Strategy E1-1-17 Transition Plan BRD Group acknowledges the importance of having a transition plan to align with climate goals and support the sustainability transition. While BRD Group does not currently have a formal transition plan in place, it is committed to developing and adopting one within its report for 2027. This timeline reflects the complexity and scope of the transition process, ensuring that the plan will be comprehensive, actionable and aligned with both regulatory requirements and the broader strategic objectives of SG. BRD Group is closely aligning its sustainability initiatives with the overarching strategy of SG. SG has established sustainability goals/targets aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement and BRD Group is working to ensure compliance with SG’s commitments, including the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) targets and sector-specific decarbonization pathways. Developing a transition plan that is fully integrated into the Group’s sustainability objectives requires time and coordination. Moreover, the evolving regulatory landscape, particularly under CSRD, requires BRD Group to carefully assess its reporting obligations and integrate sustainability considerations across all business areas. The development of a transition plan is being approached with diligence to meet these evolving requirements effectively. BRD Group is not excluded from the Paris Agreement Benchmarks. Although a formal transition plan is not yet available, BRD Group is actively engaged in sustainability initiatives that contribute to the transition process. These include: - Supporting corporate clients in their sustainability transition through financing solutions such as Sustainability-Linked Loans (SLLs) and Project Investment Financing (SPIF), focusing on renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. - Expanding green financing for retail clients by offering green loans under EU Invest sustainability support schemes and collaborating with energy efficiency solution providers. - Increasing the share of green financing in BRD Sogelease to support industries such as transport decarbonization and circular economy transitions. - Partnering with institutions such as IFC, EIB (through EIF), and EU funds programs to implement sustainability-linked projects. BRD Group is conducting internal assessments and stakeholder engagements to evaluate the readiness of its portfolios for transition. This includes:"
"106 SBM 3- 18 SBM 3- 19 - Assessing the carbon intensity of its financed sectors and developing strategies to align them with NZBA commitments. - Collaborating with SG on sector-specific origination guidelines for high-emission industries. - Conducting internal capacity-building initiatives and investing in digital tools to enhance ESG data management and reporting capabilities. To conclude, BRD Group remains committed to adopting a robust transition plan by 2027 report publication. The focus in the next two years will be on: - Continuing engagement with SG to ensure alignment with its transition strategy. - Strengthening partnerships with clients and stakeholders to support their transition journeys and gradually increasing the share of sustainable finance in the overall portfolio. - Designing and implementing internal governance frameworks to oversee the development and implementation of the transition plan. Climate-related Risks BRD Group has identified different material climate-related risks that encompass both physical risks and transition risks, reflecting the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change. For climate change adaptation, the risks are primarily climate-related physical risks, as detailed in the previous Chapter General Disclosures, Section Double Materiality Assessment Process. For climate change mitigation, the risks are primarily climate-related transition risks. These arise from the challenges of aligning with stricter environmental commitments, market evolution towards sustainability and regulatory developments, as detailed in the previous Chapter General Disclosures, Section Double Materiality Assessment Process. BRD Group’s Strategy Resilience to Climate Change BRD Group recognizes the importance of assessing the resilience of its strategy and business model in relation to climate change. While BRD Group does not currently perform a formal climate scenario analysis or stress test to evaluate the impact of climate change on its strategy, it conducts multiple recurring assessments to identify material climate-related risks and their potential effects. The DMA, conducted annually, provides insights into both physical and transition risks. Additionally, the BES exercise, performed annually, examines climate-related impacts on BRD’s key business segments, including Corporate, Retail, Sovereign Bonds, BRD Asset Management and BRD Sogelease. BRD Group also conducts an annual portfolio assessment of small enterprises with a turnover below 7.5 million EUR to evaluate their exposure to climate-related risks. Furthermore, the Industry Climate Vulnerability Indicators (ICVI) and Corporate Climate Vulnerability Indicators (CCVI) offer insights into transition risks by assessing sectoral vulnerabilities and corporate adaptation strategies. These analyses highlight key physical risks, such as disruptions caused by extreme weather events in industries like agriculture and construction, and transition risks, including regulatory changes, increased operational costs, and shifting market demands for sustainable products.

BRD Group’s Value Chain The information included in the Sustainability Statement covers the value chain of BRD Group, including upstream, own operations and downstream, and joint ventures & associates. The DMA has taken into account material Impacts, Risks and Opportunities (IROs) to the extent that BRD Group has ready access to the information. In future we consider expanding this analysis, as the CSRD develops. BRD Group’s value chain consists of the following components: - Upstream & Own Operations, which include the ownership of buildings, IT equipment, direct consumption, supplier relationships, human resources and compliance. - Downstream, which encompasses BRD Group’s core financial services’ clients, including retail, non-retail, leasing and asset management. BRD Group serves a diverse client base, including private individuals, small businesses, SMEs, and large corporations, reflecting the broad impact of its financial activities across the economy. - Joint Ventures & Associates, such as BRD Asigurări de Viață S.A. and CIT ONE S.A, which operate as business partners within BRD Group’s ecosystem. While these entities are not fully consolidated within BRD Group’s operations, they are considered in the value chain analysis, particularly in areas where their activities intersect with BRD Group’s financial services. Additionally, the Sustainability Statement provides detailed information on policies, actions, targets, and metrics that extend across the entire value chain, including BRD Group’s own operations and its relationships with upstream suppliers, downstream clients, and joint ventures & associates. Disclosures in Relation to Specific Circumstances For the preparation of the Sustainability Statement, BRD Group has adopted the same definition for short (1 year), medium (up to 5 year) and long-term (more than 5 years) as indicated by ESRS 1 section 6.4 paragraph 77. When data was not available, averages or proxies were used. Details on the estimates, data sources and any potential measurement uncertainties or assumptions are provided within the relevant Topical Chapters.

"66 BP-2-12 The List of disclosure requirements and the List of datapoints in cross-cutting and Topical Standards that derive from other EU legislation are reported in the Annex Chapter. In developing its consolidated Sustainability Statement, the Group has not relied upon other European standards nor on data and processes verified by an external assurance provider other than the provider of limited assurance for this report. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the frameworks, guidelines, policies, effectiveness of the actions, targets and metrics presented in this Sustainability Statement are not validated, audited, certified or assessed by or based on the opinion of an external body other than the assurance provider for this statement. Disclaimer Estimates and uncertainties Information related to sustainability is often subject to uncertainties stemming from the state of scientific and economic knowledge, as well as the quality of both internal and external data, such as those used for for the value chain. Moreover, prospective information, unavailable data, and the quantification of certain sustainability metrics - particularly environment data - rely on estimates and judgements based on BRD Group’s experience and internationally recognized sustainability standards. These estimates depend heavily on the hypotheses and methodological choices made. Use of estimates and associated limitations Sustainability metrics, especially those related to the BRD Group’s value chain like CO2 emissions, are based on estimates, averages, or assumptions, leading to data volatility and quality uncertainties. When direct measurement isn't possible, data from customers or external providers introduce potential inaccuracies. In the absence of specific information, sector and geographical averages are used, which may not accurately reflect the BRD Group’s customer portfolio. Greenhouse gas emissions related to financing activities often require combining multiple data sources. Emission factors, which convert consumption data into greenhouse gas emissions (GHG, in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent - tCO2eq), vary by source and context. CO2 emissions span various categories, each with inherent uncertainties. Additionally, differing methodological practices and changing regulations complicate CO2 emissions estimation across the value chain. Details on data or estimate limitations are provided in the metric descriptions. The BRD Group is committed to improving practices and methodologies as standardized, high- quality data become more available from external partners. Uncertainties inherent in forward-looking information The sustainability statement includes objectives and forward-looking statements reflecting the BRD Group’s ambitions. This information should be used cautiously, as it's based on current beliefs and economic forecasts and is subject to significant uncertainties beyond the BRD Group's control. These statements do not guarantee the realization of all ambitions. The sustainability statement outlines the BRD Group’s trajectory in line with CSRD and ESRS obligations, not a definitive outcome."
"67 BRD Group Governance Practices GOV 1- 22- a,d Sustainability Governance At BRD Group level, the Board of Directors (BoD) holds ultimate responsibility for overseeing the Group’s Sustainability Strategy, ensuring the effective management of material impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs). This includes defining long-term objectives and targets that align with the BRD Group’s commitments to stakeholders, regulatory compliance and broader ESG priorities. The BoD ensures that sustainability considerations are integrated into the BRD Group’s strategic direction, reinforcing alignment with regulatory frameworks, stakeholder expectations and the overarching sustainability commitments of Société Générale Group (SG). Through its governance role, the BoD drives responsible decision-making, monitors progress on sustainability initiatives and ensures that BRD Group remains resilient in addressing ESG challenges and opportunities. The Executive Committee (EC) is responsible for implementing the Sustainability Strategy across all relevant business lines and functions, ensuring that the defined targets are translated into actionable plans across business units. To support these efforts, the Sustainability Committee - ESG, established in 2021 and chaired by the CEO of the Bank, functions as a permanent decisional body focused on strategic CSR and ESG analysis. The members of this committee consist of permanent members, CEO together with the rest of the EC, General Secretary, ESPIF Director, Acquisitions (ACH) Director, Executive Director Financial Risk Poling, and guests from other departments (i.e. compliance, legal, logistics, human resources, business lines). This committee’s mission is to establish the actions required to implement sustainability, climate, and environmental strategies and policies in line with Bank’s objectives, The Committee’s meetings in 2024 addressed CSRD obligations, including Sustainability Strategy. A key responsibility of the committee is to monitor progress toward established sustainability targets, ensuring accountability and alignment with BRD Group’s broader ESG strategy. To this end, it evaluates key performance indicators (KPIs) and monitors sustainability initiatives, meeting periodically (twice a year or as often as necessary) to review material issues, regulatory developments and strategic objectives. The EC periodically informs the BoD regarding the progress of the Sustainability Strategy implementation, including specific aspects related to material impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs). The responsibilities related to sustainability for the BoD and EC are formalised collectively according to legal provisions (Company’s Law and Civil Code). The General Secretariat, under the CEO’s direct authority, coordinates sustainability efforts, acting as the main liaison with stakeholders on ESG matters. It also plays a central role in coordinating and monitoring progress, establishing sustainability indicators in collaboration with relevant departments and ensuring regular reporting to internal and external stakeholders. The Finance Department, reporting to the Deputy CEO Finance and Treasury, is responsible for the publication of the Annual Report which from financial year ended December 31, 2024 onwards integrates the Sustainability Statement.

Future plans include further expansion of the VRV/VRF system rollout across additional branches and continuous upgrades to heating solutions to meet evolving efficiency standards. Further evaluations will be conducted to identify additional replacement needs and future expansion opportunities in line with BRD’s long-term sustainability strategy Green IT Program (Own Operations)_ (Decarbonization lever: energy or material efficiency and consumption reduction) Energy The Green IT program, launched at SG level and implemented within BRD Group as well, directly contributes to BRD Group’s sustainability and policy objectives by significantly reducing the environmental impact of IT operations while maintaining high service quality. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated by IT activities with 50% by 2025, thus contributing to the GHG reduction target disclosed in this report. This action does not address the policies disclosed in this report and is not meant to provide for the provision of remedy for those harmed by actual material impact but rather contribute BRD Group’s commitment to a transition to a low-carbon economy. Implementing energy-efficient technologies, such as server virtualization and HVAC optimization, is expected to reduce energy consumption by approximately 1,000 MWh, equating to an estimated 400 tCO2 reduction by the end of 2025. The adoption of remote working policies, with employees working from home up to four days per week, helps minimize emissions related to daily commuting and energy use in office buildings. Additionally, workplace asset optimization, including reducing the number of printers, monitors and workstations, contributes to lower energy consumption and cost savings. The scope of BRD Group's Green IT initiatives spans across its entire value chain, including upstream activities related to procurement and sourcing of IT equipment, and downstream activities related to IT service delivery and operations. Internally, the program covers data centres, branch offices, corporate headquarters and remote working environments, affecting a broad range of stakeholders such as IT employees, operational teams and management. The program impacts external stakeholders through partnerships with waste management organizations, such as Ateliere Fără Frontiere, which facilitates the responsible recycling and refurbishment of IT equipment. Geographically, the actions cover all BRD operations across Romania, including urban and rural branch locations. The program also involves cross-functional collaboration with SG Group's global sustainability initiatives, ensuring alignment with international standards and best practices for IT-related environmental performance. BRD Group’s Green IT Program is structured within a clear timeline to ensure measurable progress toward sustainability goals. The program's initial phase started in 2019, focusing on early actions such as IT infrastructure optimization and employee awareness programs. Ongoing initiatives, such as server virtualization, printer fleet reductions, and HVAC optimizations, are expected to reach completion by the end of 2025. The CSR Guide and CO2 Simulator tools were introduced in 2024, with implementation expected to be fully integrated into IT project lifecycles in the coming years. Remote work policies, introduced in 2021, continue to be in place. Future"
"122 initiatives, such as further data centre energy efficiency improvements and the rollout of solar panel installations, are targeted for completion by H2 2025, ensuring continuous progress toward BRD’s emissions reduction targets. In the reporting year, BRD Group has implemented several initiatives under the Green IT Program, achieving good progress toward the targets. Actions taken include extensive employee training programs such as Sustainable IT Awareness and CSR in IT Projects, with 87% of IT staff trained to date. Additionally, the first Sustainability Talks session was organized in August 2024, focusing on responsible IT practices. BRD Group has also introduced strategic tools such as the CSR Guide, which helps project managers embed sustainability into IT project lifecycles, and the CO2 Simulator, which estimates the carbon footprint of IT projects from inception to production. Infrastructure optimization efforts continue, including the virtualization of servers, reducing physical hardware by 37% from 2019 to 2024 (decreasing from 650 in 2019 to 470 by end-2024), and the installation of solar panels in data centers to further cut emissions. Workplace asset optimization initiatives, such as printer fleet and workstation reductions, are ongoing, with notable reductions already achieved: 39% reduction in the printer fleet, with a total decrease of 1,836 units, and workstation decommissioning by 58%, removing 1,300 thin clients and workstations from operations. Air conditioning replacement efforts across 100 agencies have further contributed to energy savings. These achievements reflect BRD’s commitment to continuous improvement and transparency in reducing its IT-related carbon footprint. Future plans include extending these initiatives by further optimizing data center operations, increasing energy efficiency, and expanding sustainable sourcing practices across IT operations. No significant monetary amounts were required to implement this action. Metrics and Targets MDR-T E-1-4 Established Targets Related to Climate Change Target 1 Achieve EUR 2.4 billion in sustainable finance28 cumulated production by 2027 BRD Group's target to achieve EUR 2.4 billion in sustainable finance production by 2027 aligns with the SG Group’s sustainability policies and objectives. This target supports the SG Environmental and Social (E&S) General Principles by integrating environmental and social considerations into financial decision-making, mitigating risks, and ensuring compliance with regulations. It also aligns with Sector-wide E&S Policies, helping BRD 28 Sustainable financing refers to financial transactions that generate environmental and/or social benefits, aligning with either the Green & Sustainability Linked Loans Framework or the Green Financing Framework, and may include positive impact financing (PIF), sustainability-linked loans (SLL), and other specialized loans like blue or gender loans. Sustainable financing encompasses green or social loans used to finance or refinance eligible Green/Social Projects, with methodologies and criteria that are internally defined and distinct from the EU Taxonomy's criteria, being less stringent than those in the EU Taxonomy. Consequently, not all sustainable finance provided by BRD Group will meet the strict criteria for EU Taxonomy alignment and the Sustainable Financing metric and target presented hereinafter in this report is an internal metric and must not be confused with the Green Asset Ratio (GAR) KPI under the EU Taxonomy."
"123 prioritize financing in sustainable sectors while avoiding environmentally harmful industries. Furthermore, the target contributes to SG’s Climate Policy, supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy by financing green projects and reducing exposure to carbon- intensive sectors. It is also in line with the SG Positive Impact Financing Bond Framework, which promotes investments in projects that generate positive environmental and social impacts, such as renewable energy and social inclusion, while ensuring transparent reporting and accountability. The target is also used to track the effectiveness of the “Business plan for sustainable and positive impact financing” disclosed under “Actions Related to Climate Change Adaptation, Climate Change Mitigation and Energy”. This target addresses all climate change mitigation adaptation and energy material impacts, risks and opportunities, apart from the negative impacts related to carbon emissions and the use of non-renewable energy, addressed by Target 2, described below. The target applies to all BRD activities related to sustainable finance, including corporate lending, retail banking. It covers financing activities across downstream value chains, addressing direct clients and potential clients. The geographical scope includes BRD’s operational regions, primarily Romania, with potential contributions from SG Group initiatives across the broader European market. Upstream value chain does not fall under the scope of this target. The target applies to the period 2023-2027, with regular interim milestones to monitor progress. Annual reviews are conducted to ensure alignment with BRD Group's sustainability goals and regulatory expectations, with interim targets set for each year to ensure a steady trajectory towards the 2027 goal. The target is defined using methodologies aligned with international sustainability frameworks and SG/BRD Group’s sustainability strategies. Significant assumptions include the continued availability, stable economic conditions, and increasing client demand for sustainable financial products. Data sources include internal financial reporting systems, regulatory disclosures, and third-party verification mechanisms to ensure accuracy for certain categories (SLL financing). Key stakeholders, including clients, investors, regulatory bodies, and internal sustainability committees, have been actively involved in defining the target. Stakeholder engagement includes consultations with industry experts, partnerships with environmental organizations, and dialogue with policymakers to ensure the target aligns with market needs and regulatory frameworks. Progress towards the sustainable finance target is monitored and reviewed regularly through internal governance structures, in the quarterly monitoring of business strategy and financial reporting systems. Metrics used to track progress include the total volume of sustainable financing, progress towards the established targets, trends of evolution compared to the target. In addition, on an annual basis, we assess the trend of the sustainable finance market. Performance is assessed through quarterly and annual reviews, ensuring that progress remains in line with initial projections and allowing for corrective actions if necessary. This is a quantitative indicator, and no explicit qualitative data is used to monitor progress. Target 2"
"124 Achieve a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline. The target was established in alignment with BRD Group’s strategic vision outlined in the Horizons 2027 strategy, ensuring a cohesive approach to our objectives. It does not however address the policies disclosed in this report. We note that the methodology used to calculate the baseline value for the reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations was internally developed and refers to categories of emissions associated with Scope 1, 2 and selected categories in scope 3, as described above. The target set by us of reduction with 55% of the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027 is set in accordance with the above mentioned methodology. Our goal is to achieve this current target by 2027 and set a new GHG reduction target as part of our future Transition Plan. However, the methodology disclosed in section ""Metrics related to climate change"" as well as the actual values for GHG emissions under Scope 1, 2 and selected categories from scope 3 is different from the methodology used to determine the baseline value for carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations. The defined target is to achieve a 55% absolute reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline of 20,071 tons of CO2 (tCO2). The target is expressed in absolute terms, measured in metric tons of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e). The target covers BRD Group’s direct operations, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions across all office buildings, branches, data centres, and operational facilities within Romania. It does not currently extend to upstream or down-stream value chains but focuses on emissions under the Group’s direct control, ensuring a significant impact within BRD Group’s geographical operations. BRD Group ensures the consistency of its GHG reduction targets with its GHG inventory boundaries by aligning its emissions accounting and reduction initiatives with internationally recognized standards and frameworks, including the GHG Protocol. The defined target of a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of BRD Group’s own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline, covers the same organizational and operational boundaries used in the annual GHG inventory assessment. The GHG inventory encompasses Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, covering direct emissions from owned or controlled sources (e.g., company vehicles, heating systems) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, and cooling. Additionally, relevant Scope 3 emissions, namely employee commuting and business travel, are monitored to assess their impact and identify potential reduction opportunities. This approach ensures that BRD Group’s emissions reduction initiatives cover and address all significant sources of operational carbon emissions. BRD Group's integrated environmental management system enables accurate data collection, validation, and reporting across all relevant operational sites. Yearly external audits and reviews are conducted to validate the consistency between the defined GHG targets and the inventory boundaries, ensuring that any adjustments or operational changes (such as new office locations, fleet modifications, or energy procurement strategies) are reflected in both the target and the inventory."
"125 BRD Group has established 2019 as the base year for its GHG emissions reduction target, with a baseline value of 20,071 tCO2 from its own operations. This baseline was determined through a comprehensive assessment of emissions data collected across all operational sites, covering both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and selected Scope 3 categories. The 2019 baseline serves as a reference point for measuring progress and tracking the effectiveness of BRD's emissions reduction initiatives. BRD Group has selected 2019 as the baseline year for its GHG emissions reduction target due to its operational stability and typical consumption levels. While 2020 was a potential candidate for the baseline, it was excluded due to the significant disruption caused by the COVID- 19 pan-demic, which led to abnormal consumption patterns and a reduction in overall operational activity. This drastic reduction in emissions and energy use in 2020 could have negatively influenced the data, making it an unreliable reference for normal operations. To ensure that the baseline is representative of typical activity levels, 2019 was chosen as it reflects a year of normal operational performance without the external disruptions that occurred in 2020. This baseline value was reviewed to ensure that it reflects BRD Group's operational emissions prior to any significant external factors or anomalies. An intensity value GHG reduction target is not yet established. The target period spans from 2019 to 2027. In 2024 it was achieved a reduction of 45% compared to the 2019 baseline. Further reviews and adjustments are planned annually to ensure the Group remains on track to achieve its final 2027 goal. No specific milestones or interim targets were established. The target was defined using methodologies aligned with international best practices, namely the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Data sources include internal energy consumption reports, contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy and regulatory environmental disclosures. In developing the target EU Green Deal, Paris Agreement, and Romania’s national climate goals were considered. Assumptions include a stable regulatory environment, continued adoption of energy-efficient technologies, and employee engagement in sustainability initiatives. Stakeholders, namely internal specialized teams and operational managers were actively involved in the target-setting process. Employee engagement initiatives, such as awareness campaigns and training sessions, also played a crucial role in shaping the target, ensuring alignment with both business operations and employee expectations. Performance is monitored through the integrated environmental management system, with annual reviews conducted to track emissions, assess trends, and identify areas for further improvement. Key metrics include total CO2 emissions, energy efficiency indicators, and cost savings from energy reduction initiatives. Progress remains on track, with ongoing measures such as remote work policies, energy-efficient infrastructure upgrades, and fleet greening programs supporting continued reductions. Decarbonization levers related to target 2 BRD Group has identified several key decarbonisation levers, described under E1-3 which will contribute to the achievement of its GHG emissions reduction targets for own operations. These levers include: - Energy Efficiency Improvements: The Group is implementing measures to reduce energy consumption across its operations, including the optimization of energy use in office spaces and reducing the energy intensity of production processes. This lever"
"126 will primarily contribute to the reduction of Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased energy). - Fuel Switching: BRD will transition to low-carbon or renew-able fuels in its operations, particularly for any remaining fossil fuel use. The move to electric vehicles (EVs) and the greening of the car fleet by adopting Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) will lower emissions in Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) by replacing traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. - Renewable Energy Adoption: One of the key actions will be to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or green electricity, in its operations, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions. This includes potential on-site renewable energy generation and the purchase of renewable energy. - Operational Optimization: BRD is enhancing operational efficiencies through technology upgrades, such as automation systems, which improve energy management and reduce overall emissions. For GHG emissions Scope 1, the greening of the car fleet (with BEVs/PHEVs) and a reduction in fossil fuel usage across BRD Group’s operations are expected to be the primary decarbonisation measures. Also, switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon or renewable fuels and enhancing energy efficiency in BRD’s building operations will also help reduce direct emissions. Transitioning to renewable energy (solar, wind, and green energy) for BRD’s office buildings and operational facilities will reduce Scope 2 emissions. Additionally, energy-efficient equipment and technologies implemented across operations will reduce energy demand, further de-creasing Scope 2 emissions. Use of new technology in achieving target 2 To achieve the GHG emission reduction targets, BRD Group is investing in new technologies that will accelerate decarbonisation, particularly for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Some examples include: - Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure: By adopting BEVs and PHEVs for the company’s car fleet, BRD Group will reduce its Scope 1 emissions. In addition, the Group is investing in charging infrastructure to support these vehicles. - Energy-efficient Technologies: BRD will continue to implement advanced energy- efficient technologies in buildings, such as smart building management systems that optimize energy consumption in real-time. - Data Analytics for Energy Optimization: The use of data analytics tools and IT devices will enhance operational efficiencies and energy management, improving energy use efficiency and reducing carbon intensity. Targets alignment with Paris Agreement objectives BRD Group has established two key targets to address its environmental impact: (1) achieving EUR 2.4 billion in sustainable finance production by 2027, and (2) achieving a 55% reduction in the carbon footprint of its own operations by 2027, compared to the 2019 baseline. However, it is important to note that these targets are not science-based and have not been explicitly aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The methodology used to determine these targets is primarily based on internal assessments, industry benchmarks and alignment with SG Group ambitions, rather than a sectoral decarbonization pathway. BRD Group’s carbon reduction target for operational emissions is derived from an analysis of its historical emissions, operational energy efficiency initiatives, and anticipated improvements in energy procurement and building infrastructure. The sustainable finance target is based on the SG Group’s strategic"
"127 E1-5 commitment to financing projects aligned with environmental and social objectives, with a focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and green infrastructure. Underlying climate and policy scenarios have been considered to a limited extent in the target-setting process. While BRD Group acknowledges the importance of regulatory factors such as the EU Green Deal, and the Taxonomy Regulation, the current targets are primarily based on achievable operational improvements and projected market trends rather than detailed climate scenario modelling. In setting these targets, BRD Group has considered several critical assumptions, including: - Future developments in regulatory factors: anticipated tightening of energy efficiency regulations and environmental reporting requirements. - Technological advancements: the adoption of energy-efficient technologies and digital solutions to reduce emissions across owned operations. - Changes in customer preferences and demand: an expected increase in demand for green financial products and services, supporting the sustainable finance goal. - Potential business growth: expansion of operations and potential changes in energy consumption patterns, which have been factored into reduction estimates. BRD Group confirms that the GHG reduction targets have not been externally assured, though internal reviews and progress monitoring mechanisms are in place to track achievement against the stated objectives. Climate Scenario In setting BRD Group’s GHG reduction target, climate scenarios were not explicitly considered as part of the target-setting process. While climate scenarios were not formally included in the initial tar-get-setting phase, BRD Group has committed to reducing its carbon footprint in alignment with broader environmental regulations and market developments, including the EU Green Deal and EU climate targets. Metrics related to climate change This section presents the key metrics that have been identified as material for tracking BRD Group’s performance in relation to the material IROs. These metrics provide insights into the effectiveness of the BRD Group’s IROs management strategies and its commitment to address climate change. The calculations for the energy consumption for BRD and Sogelease were made based in the invoices received by the suppliers. The data were afterwards inputted by the internal teams based on the different types of energy required by the reporting standard. For the renewable energy, the explanation is provided under the Contractual instruments used for the sale and purchase of energy paragraph below. For BRD AM, the data was provided by the owner of the building in which BRD AM is headquarter.
