"ENVIRONMENT Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 41 Climate change and energy Fit to tackle climate change Following our DMA outcomes, we recognise that extreme weather events and other climate-related risks can have material effects on our business, and we aim to take action to adapt our business. We understand that to adapt effectively it will be necessary to begin by gaining clear insights into the types of risks and opportunities that climate change creates for us. This would help us to assess the resilience of our business in relation to such risks and define adaptation solutions as needed. With this objective in mind, Basic-Fit conducted its first climate-related risks and opportunities assessment (CRRO) in 2024. The outcomes of this, including how climate change-induced extreme weather events can affect our business, are presented in this section. We also work to mitigate our impact on climate change, mainly by reducing our GHG emissions through a more efficient use of energy. Last year, we set out to measure our Scope 3 emissions for the first time, and we now have a process for reporting our full emissions inventory, including improvements in our measurement of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions. Additionally, we will develop a register of climate change mitigation actions, including related decarbonisation levers and expected emissions reductions. All of this information is vital to develop a transition plan for climate change mitigation in a serious and well- informed manner. With these outcomes, we intend to have such a transition plan by the end of 2025. As a leader in the fitness industry, it is Basic-Fit’s aim to implement a strong climate-related policy, yet this is still in the draft stage, including considerations of how we will manage other environmental impacts. We anticipate such a policy will tackle climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as renewable energy deployment, with approval and launch expected in the course of 2025. At the moment, Basic-Fit is thus unable to describe in detail the key climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, targets or resources allocated to the implementation of this policy. That said, we are already engaged in certain climate change mitigation efforts, such as installation of solar panels and HVAC control systems, which are intended to reduce our energy"
"Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 42 consumption and related emissions. These are included in the EU Taxonomy section of this report. As part of our Go for a fitter world programme, we are committed to working to reduce our emissions. However, specific related targets will be defined in 2025, when we have a better understanding of our full emissions inventory and decarbonisation trajectories. Currently, recognising that reducing energy use lowers related emissions, progress in the former serves as an indicator of the effectiveness of our efforts. Climate-related risks and opportunities assessment The core analysis consisted of identifying the material1 physical and transition risks and opportunities to the business through a climate-related scenario analysis 2.The physical and transition risks and opportunities were listed and determined as per Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. The selected scenarios were compatible with the climate- related assumptions and expectations made in our financial statements. Our efforts to reduce energy consumption, which can be considered as supporting climate mitigation, were considered mainly during the identification of transition risks and opportunities, effectively resulting at the basis of one risk and one opportunity identified (as described below). For physical risks, the analysis used climate scenario data from a low emissions pathway (SSP1-2.6)3and a high emissions pathway (SSP5-8.5), with SSP5-8.5 representing a ‘reasonable’ worst-case climate scenario by 2050. Due to limitations in data availability and reach, Basic-Fit could not extend 2024’s physical risks analysis to its value chain. We are planning to include the value chain by the fourth year of our ESRS reporting. We investigated a representative sample of clubs, allowing optimal use of our in- house data while still obtaining results with an acceptable level of granularity. To determine materiality, we analysed the relevant physical hazards under each pathway. The results are visualised and explained in the tables ‘physical risks’ and ‘transitional risks and opportunities’ below. We found water stress to be a material physical risk in all scenarios. A majority of clubs in the sample were at risk of either flooding or drought due to changing precipitation patterns. Heatwaves, heat stress, and storms are also projected to become highly material in a high-emissions pathway scenario. We identified key transition risks and opportunities via an internal relevance assessment, including workshops with internal stakeholders. We used climate scenarios from recognised sources, such as the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). These entail a ‘low-carbon’ net-zero policy scenario and a ‘business-as-usual’ scenario aligned with current climate policies. Each analysis scenario implements a 2030, 2040, and 2050 timeframe. We used the low -carbon scenario to map the transition risks and opportunities. The analysis also extended to Basic- Fit’s value chain as, being qualitative, data insights into the topics were more obtainable. The detailed results are explained in the ‘material transition risks and opportunities’ table below. The changes in materiality over the different timeframes are also visualised in this table. To briefly summarise our assessment, volatile energy prices were found to remain a material transition risk in 2040 and 2050. While material in 2030, the efforts to decarbonise Basic- Fit’s value chain are expected to decrease in materiality in 2040 and 2050. The analysis found one material transition opportunity in Basic-Fit’s proactive management of energy consumption, which may lead to significant savings. It is expected to remain a material opportunity across all three timeframes of the ‘low-carbon’ scenario. As a follow up to this Climate-related risks and opportunities assessment (CRRO) assessment, in 2025 we will organise workshops to identify adaptation solutions, with the aim of monitoring their effectiveness during implementation. Additionally, we plan to carry out an internal review of the CRRO on a yearly basis, to ensure results remain faithful to changing climate developments. 1 The term ‘material’ in this section is different from the use of the term in the DMA section, the CRRO followed a different methodology and the outcomes were not specifically considered during the DMA. As such, the term ‘material’ here, can be considered as pointing to the most significant physical risks and transition events. 2 A detailed account of our impacts on GHG emissions was not included in this analysis. Reporting on such impacts is covered in the 'GHG Emissions' section. 3 SSP stands for 'Shared Socioeconomic Pathways', a set of scenarios developed by the international scientific community to facilitate climate policy and impact analyses"

Material by 2050 Heat stress could lead to significant increases in expenditure associated with additional energy usage for increased cooling requirements, and additional expenditure if additional HVAC systems require installation. B Heat Waves An extended period of hot weather relative to the expected conditions of the area at that time of year, which may be accompanied by high humidity. Material by 2030 The high proportion of sites which could be impacted by heatwaves could lead to significant increases in expenditure associated with additional energy usage for increased cooling requirements, and additional expenditure if additional HVAC systems require installation. C Water Stress Water stress occurs when the demand for water exceeds the available amount during a certain period or when poor quality restricts its use. Material at baseline Stress on water availability could lead to increased expenditures if the cost of water increases. There may also be disruptions to operations if there are caps on water usage. D Storm Events of winds ranging from 75 to 88 km/h, with heavy storms reaching speeds from 89 to 102 km/h. This risk includes blizzards, dust and sandstorms. Material by 2050 There is a general projected increase in severe windstorms in the countries of Basic-Fit’s operations and the severity of the potential impacts related to storms. These impacts could include increase expenditure for general maintenance following storm events e.g., fixing roofs or clearing flood waters. There may be reduced revenue if clubs need to shut following damages from a serious storm event."
"1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 Likelihood Financial effect R1 R2 O1 Key Risk 2030 2040 2050 Opportunity low to medium medium to high high to very high Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 44 Transitional risks and opportunities Description Category Outlook Justification R1 Volatile energy prices Several factors could drive energy prices up in the short to medium term, including stricter carbon pricing regulations (such as the EU ETS and taxes) and investment slowdown in new fossil projects, leading to supply-demand impairment. Additionally, increased reliance on renewable sources like solar and wind can contribute to price volatility due to their variable nature and dependency on weather conditions. Transition Risk Material by 2030 As a value-for-money business focused on efficiency, volatile energy prices pose a significant risk directly affecting the company's cost structure and profitability. Although scenarios suggest a long-term decrease in electricity prices, fluctuations due to geopolitical factors, technology readiness, and weather variability could result in increased operational expenditure. R2 Internal global supply chain decarbonisation efforts Basic-Fit primarily relies on suppliers which manufacture in Asia for its fitness equipment. The construction and transportation of this equipment present environmental impacts. Although Basic-Fit does not operate in a high- emitting sector, substantial efforts and changes may be required if the company engages in decarbonizing its upstream indirect emissions. Material by 2030 The risk associated with Basic-Fit’s supply chain decarbonisation effort is expected to peak by 2030, potentially significantly impacting expenditure. Increased scrutiny from regulators and investors is pressuring companies to reduce value chain emissions, which may raise costs, particularly for greener transport services and club furnishing material. In the medium to long term, initial supplier investments in decarbonisation are expected to eventually reduce cost pressures. O1 Proactive management of energy consumption Basic-Fit can achieve operational savings through improved energy management and efficiency measures. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, upgrading its heating and cooling systems, and further electrifying its vehicle fleet, Basic- Fit can reduce energy costs and minimise its environmental impact. Transition Opportunity Material by 2030 Managing energy consumption presents significant cost-saving opportunities for Basic-Fit. As energy is a major expense, cost-efficient reductions directly increase the company’s profitability. Since launching its heating and cooling system retrofitting program, Basic-Fit has seen a return on investment through improved energy efficiency and reduced expenditure with each upgrade"
"Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 45 Energy powering our operations Controlling our use of energy and ensuring that it comes from renewable sources is key to the reduction of our direct emissions. It also helps us also to improve the cost efficiency of our club operations. As such, Basic-Fit sees energy use as a strategically important topic. In broad terms, energy consumed in Basic-Fit operations consists primarily of purchased electricity and gas for running clubs and offices, self-generated renewable energy from solar panels and fuel for company vehicles. Sources of energy consumed Country Energy from fossil sources (MWh) Energy from nuclear sources (MWh) Energy from renewable sources Total (MWh) Purchased (MWh) Self- generated (MWh) Belgium 12,892 114 33,747 106 46,859 Germany 3,316 106 77 - 3,499 Spain 17,011 10,098 966 - 28,075 France 16,105 103,385 5,560 - 125,050 Luxembourg - - 1,929 - 1,929 Netherlands 15,310 2 37,202 1,478 53,991 Total 64,634 113,706 79,480 1,584 259,404 Basic-Fit has taken some actions in 2024 to address our negative impacts on the environment. This includes the installation of solar panels, heat pumps, efficient water boilers and HVAC control systems. These actions were taken with the expected outcome of reducing our energy consumption and related emissions. You can find more information on these actions in Note 2.3 of the Financial Statements.

It is disaggregated by country. Company leased cars and self-generated renewable energy are also taken into account in these results. Actual electricity data was available for 73% of clubs and gas data for 68% of relevant clubs. In cases where actual energy consumption data for 2024 was unavailable, we calculated the median energy usage per club per square metre for each country, using actual data sourced directly from energy suppliers and smart meters. This information was then used to estimate energy consumption for clubs without data, based on their size (in square metres). Regarding the disaggregation of energy by sources, we applied the following: 1 The electricity purchased in France, Spain, and Germany was disaggregated based on information from national suppliers or energy authorities regarding country-level electricity generation sources. Basic-Fit intends to purchase GOs for total electricity consumption in 2024, with the purchase planned for 2025 once electricity consumption data has been settled, and the actual consumption is known. As a result, the energy mix indicated in this report may be updated accordingly. 2 In the Netherlands and Belgium, all electricity purchased was classified as renewable based on purchased guarantees of origin (GOs) certifying that electricity comes from renewable sources. 3 In Luxembourg, the energy contract certifies that all electricity comes from renewable sources. 1 This means the 'Sources of energy consumed' table presents totals for the following disclosures: E1-5 37a, 37b, 37cii and 37ciii. 37ci is not applicable to Basic-Fit."
"Sustainability Statement Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 46 4 Gas consumption is accounted as ‘energy from fossil sources’. 5 Fuel consumption by company leased cars is accounted for as ‘energy from fossil sources’ and is based on data from fleet reports. An assumption of 5.5 L/100km was applied for fuel consumption. Energy consumption from electric company- leased cars is considered under purchased electricity. Regarding the disclosure requirement applicable to high climate impact sectors (disaggregation of sources as per paragraph 38), we consider this does not apply to Basic-Fit, as we deem our operations to be classified under NACE 2 section R code 93.13 ‘Activities of fitness facilities’, whilst the ESRS defines high climate impact sectors as those listed in NACE Sections A to H and L. Regarding renewable energy production data from our solar panels (E1-5 39), we had access to actual solar generation data for all relevant clubs. In cases where a club produced more renewable energy than it could consume, the excess energy was returned to the grid. The amount of renewable energy sold is based on actual data from the energy supplier and is reported in the table ""renewable energy production"". The difference between the self-generated renewable energy produced and sold is reported in the table 'Sources of energy consumed', under self-generated renewable energy (E1-5 37ciii). Basic-Fit did not engage in the production of non-renewable energy (E1-5 39). GHG Emissions Last year, we undertook a full calculation of our emissions inventory, updating our calculations of Scope 1 and 2 emissions and for the first time measuring our Scope 3 emissions. In summary, the emissions comprise the following: Scope 1 emissions relate to gas consumption in clubs and offices, travel using vehicles leased by Basic-Fit, and refrigerant fluids used in heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and refrigeration machines. Scope 2 emissions are related to the indirect emissions based on the electricity purchased by Basic-Fit. This is equivalent to the electricity consumption as reported under E1-5. The Scope 2 emissions reported here include the gross location-based and market-based emissions. Scope 3 emissions are calculated after assessing the applicability of the corresponding 15 categories in the GHG protocol. Applicable categories are included in the GHG emissions table below. The following Scope 3 categories were excluded from the calculation: • Upstream and Downstream Leased Assets: Leased assets, including vehicles and buildings, were accounted for under other categories, as they are integral to Basic-Fit’s operations. • Processing of Sold Products: Basic-Fit does not engage in the sale of intermediate products. • Franchises: Basic-Fit did not operate franchises in 2024. 2 Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE 2.1) https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902521/KS-RA-07-015-EN.PDF]"

Scope 1&2 emissions are disaggregated by country. Scope 2 emissions also include the gross location-based and market-based emissions. 0% of Scope 1 GHG emissions come from regulated emission trading schemes. Basic-Fit did not purchase any carbon credits in 2024 and did not participate in any GHG removal or GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits. Basic-Fit has not applied any internal carbon pricing schemes. All emissions disclosed correspond to the consolidated accounting group. Scope 3 Emissions The highest emitting categories for Scope 3 were purchased goods and services, capital goods and visitors. • Category 1 - Purchased goods and services: The largest share of the purchased goods and services was attributed to the purchased services. Emissions from purchased services were calculated using supplier cost data. For each supplier, industry-specific emission factors from BaseCarbone (v23.4 & 2022), ExioBase (2022) and GES1points5 (2019) were used to determine the associated emissions. • Category 2 - Capital goods: primarily related to the construction or renovation of new leased buildings and gym equipment. The building emissions were calculated based on the square meter data of new clubs opened in 2024, combined with emission factors from EcoInvent (3.10.1). Gym equipment emissions were based on delivery data from the equipment supplier which included the actual number of items delivered and the weight of the products in 2024. This was allocated per country according to the number of new clubs in each country. Due to data availability assumptions were made to estimate the composition of gym equipment. Emission factors from IPCC (2021) were then used to estimate associated emissions. • Category 11 - Visitors: Although not required by the GHG Protocol, the guidance for the calculation of Scope 3 emissions category 11 'use of sold products' provides the option to include indirect use-phase emissions. This subcategory can be connected with the emissions generated by our Visitors’, traveling from their home to our clubs. To obtain a more complete view of our emissions inventory, Basic-Fit conducted a survey to assess visitor travel emissions. The survey collected data on transport modes and travel distances for members commuting to and from clubs. Survey results indicate an average travel distance of 8 km, which is used to estimate emissions for all visitors, including members and their friends. The results are presented as additional lines in the emissions calculation table below. We will refine this measurement in the future to obtain a clearer view of the size and significance of this type of emissions in our inventory. Scope 3 emissions from categories 4, 6, 9, 12 and 15 individually account for less than 1% of total emissions. Categories 3, 5 and 7 have minor impacts accounting for less than 5% individually and data quality efforts are underway for future reporting. Our calculation methods for these categories are in line with the GHG Protocol and include activity-based method, distance-based approach, average- activity method, average spend-based method and other hybrid methods. Scope 3 Emissions calculated using primary data Where available, Scope 3 emissions are calculated using primary data, supported with assumptions where necessary. For the significant categories the use of primary data is stated under the section 'Scope 3 emissions' above. This includes parts of category 5 from waste collection contract data detailing liters collected and collection frequency, parts of category 6 with data from an external travel report with actual costs and kilometres travelled by employees, and parts of category 7 based on HR-reported actual distances and hours worked. Additionally, primary data is used for categories 2, 4, and 9, incorporating supplier-provided details on gym equipment quantity and weight, as well as category 2 solar panel data, including the actual number and type of panels."

"Basic-Fit Annual Report 2024 78 RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL SYSTEMS Achieving our long-term strategic objectives inherently involves taking risks. This makes risk management an essential element of Basic-Fit's culture, corporate governance, strategy, and operational and financial management. Basic-Fit carefully considers the types of risks we take and our risk appetite in achieving our objectives. Basic-Fit’s risk management approach plays an important role in achieving our strong international growth ambitions and creating long-term value. Description and governance The responsibilities for risk management extend across all levels of the organisation, embedding these duties throughout the hierarchy. This comprehensive approach fosters a culture of accountability and vigilance, enabling us to identify and mitigate risks promptly while upholding high standards of governance and compliance. The Management Board, under the supervision of the Supervisory Board, is responsible for identifying and managing the risks associated with the company’s strategy and activities. The Management Board, therefore, bears ultimate responsibility for designing and establishing Basic-Fit's risk management and internal control framework, and for creating and promoting the right business culture and values. The members of the Leadership Team, being the members of the Management Board, as well as the CCO and COO, serve as Risk Sponsors, bearing responsibility for establishing risk appetite levels that are aligned with strategic goals and associated risks’ severity, provide feedback and recommendations on significant emerging risks identified, and oversight of the Basic-Fit actions and controls in response to risks being taken. The Audit and Risk Committee supervises the effectiveness of the internal control systems and reports annually to the Supervisory Board regarding the methods used to access the effectiveness of the design and operation of the internal risk management and control systems. The Supervisory Board approves the overall strategic objectives and regularly discusses the principal risks associated with the strategy."
