"2.4.2 Management of IROs Related to Biodiversity and Ecosystems and their Interaction with the Strategy To date, Edison does not have a Biodiversity Transition Plan, but, aware of its role as a responsible energy operator, it implements operational models to manage and mitigate its impacts by taking a proactive approach. Specifically, in order to orient its “Road to nature” from a methodological perspective, and consolidate the resilience of its strategy and business model concerning nature, Edison bases its actions on the ACT-D framework (the acronym stands for Assess - Commit - Transform and Disclose), promoted by the Capital Coalition2, progressively implementing the LEAP approach as well (which stands for Locate, Evaluate - identify dependencies and impacts linked to nature, Assess - assess risks and opportunities, Prepare - prepare to manage them in an integrated manner in the Company’s strategy) promoted by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This way of acting is also reflected in the methodology illustrated in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) document ""Roadmap to Nature Positive → Foundations for the energy system"". Therefore, the first step (Locate) carried out by Edison was to identify the Company's main sectors and sub-sectors and, with reference to the electricity generation sector, verify the location of sites in terms of their proximity to sensitive areas 2 A global network of companies, organisations and financial institutions committed to the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework; namely, reversing biodiversity loss by 2050 and contributing to ecosystem restoration."
