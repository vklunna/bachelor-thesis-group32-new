This action of regulating and modulating releases also contributes to the regeneration of water bodies. A plan for the development of flexibility systems by means of hydroelectric pumping is being implemented by the Company by adding new pumping plants to already existing reservoirs in Italy (typically reservoirs built by Cassa del Mezzogiorno), enhancing the availability of water resources; two projects in these areas – mentioned in the section C.2.1.5 have reached a high stage of the authorisation progress. Water withdrawal, consumption, reuse and recovery Actions Edison withdraws and consumes water for industrial purposes, mainly for cooling machinery in thermoelectric production, and to a lesser extent for processes such as cleaning/washing, fire-fighting networks, backup heating networks and/or in waste treatment and biomethane production processes. The largest share of the water withdrawn by Edison's production plants comes from marine supplies, and the remainder consists of freshwater withdrawals; where the local context has allowed it, however, Edison has favoured the use of treated wastewater, typically supplied by water management consortia or treated directly on site through ad hoc plants (about 2%). In addition, the Group's thermoelectric power plants, as required by industry BAT, use either air-cooling systems using forced-air condensers or wet-dry cooling towers. With the aim of reducing water use, in 2024 the new Presenzano Thermoelectric Power Plant was designed in such a way as to ensure a limited use of water resources through the adoption of air cooling systems. Edison also pays special attention to internal water recovery and reuse (understood as water/wastewater used at least twice before being discharged from the perimeter of the Company or shared plants, so as to reduce water requirements). A few examples are: in thermoelectric plants, a forced-ventilated air condenser is used for steam condensation and for cooling auxiliary equipment; low conductivity water from the regeneration of the demi plant and mains condensate are fed back into the steam cycle; in others, the water from the cooling circuit of the condenser and part of the plant is used in a closed circuit, with temperature abatement by means of wet-dry type evaporative towers; there are demineralised water recovery systems, regeneration water recovery systems or recirculated water systems used to supply toilet flushing systems. Edison Next also ensures proper and circular water management for its customers by enabling the recovery and regeneration of primary and waste water, leveraging skills and experience acquired over the years in the field of environmental services. Edison also maps water stressed areas (through the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas), superimposing it on the location of its plants for an awareness of efficient water resource use. Of the total water consumed (defined as the amount of water entering the plant's perimeter that is not discharged back into the aquatic environment or to third parties during the reporting period), approximately 30% occurs in areas of high-water stress. In 2024, 58 plants (thermoelectric power plants, cogeneration plants, waste treatment plants and biogas/biomethane plants) distributed between Italy, Poland and Spain were mapped, of which 28 are located in areas with very high or high water stress, i.e., 48% of the total number of mapped plants; in these cases, the incidence of consumption in relation to the quantity withdrawn is <0.006%, thanks to the technological precautions taken/best practices adopted."
"2024 Financial Report Management, Sustainability and Governance Report Consolidated financial statements Separate financial statements 137 Finally, water is also an issue for the Group's upstream value chain, in particular with regard to the extraction of minerals to manufacture components necessary for the production and distribution of electricity as well as for fuel supply. In this regard, please see the actions implemented within ESRS S2 on the topic of responsible procurement. As a responsible operator, Edison joined the CEO Water Mandate in 2024, an initiative promoted by the UN to promote proper water management by companies, with the aim of committing to act responsibly and publicly on the issue of water. In addition, Edison has adopted a specific Water Action Plan with the objective of annually monitoring consumption by correlating it with areas of very high or high water stress, mapping and disseminating the best practices implemented by individual plants, and participating in multi-stakeholder working tables with the aim of raising awareness of the issue and seizing new opportunities. Lastly, with a view to avoiding and reducing the impact of Company activities on water consumption in the construction site phases, Edison has adopted specific internal guidelines (for construction sites in general and wind farms more specifically) with the aim of implementing specific protection and prevention procedures. Raising awareness of responsible water consumption Actions The responsible management of water also in the daily lives of citizens is the subject of awareness-raising and engagement activities carried out throughout the corporate population (as in the case of the Sustainable Officesproject launched in 2021 with the goal of promoting sustainable behaviour in the workplace) but also in the territories and communities where Edison is present with its plants: between 2023 and early 2024, Edison and the Costruiamo il Futuro Foundation launched 'The Energy of Water' contest, addressed to elementary, middle and secondary schools in the Valtellina Valley, to address the link between water sources, renewable energy sources and environmental impact. As envisaged in the Sustainability Plan, Edison's goal is to continue conducting awareness-raising activities by also participating in multi-stakeholder tables throughout the territory in which it operates. C.2.3.5 Metrics and Targets With reference to the commitment related to monitoring and the action plan for responsible management of water resources (see section chapter C.1.4.3), the following table presents the monitoring parameters: Water consumption Total water consumption (m3) 6,584,263 Total water consumption (m3) in areas at water risk, including areas of high-water stress 2,073,598 Total volume of water recycled and reused (m3) 881,883 Total volume of water stored and changes in storage (m3) N.A. Water intensity - total water consumption in own operations (m3 per euros of net revenue) 0.0004"
"2024 Financial Report Management, Sustainability and Governance Report Consolidated financial statements Separate financial statements 138 The revenue taken into account refers to the Sales Revenues presented in the Consolidated Group Financial Statements, which are integrated with the values relating to Edison Stoccaggio SpA classified as Discontinued Operations in the financial reporting pursuant to IFRS5 and included in Scope of reporting of the Sustainability Statement (ref. Note 2 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements) Water consumption was calculated with the following data: • total quantities in m3: 335,510,370 • total discharges in m3: 325,036,840 • n. sites in areas of high/very high water stress: 28 Sites in areas of high/very high water stress have been determined according to the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (WRI). The calculations expressed in terms of withdrawal and discharge are the use of site specific counters Calculations expressed in terms of consumption were calculated from the difference between (collection-discharge) taking into account specific activities such as those related to waste water treatment plants (TAR). Lastly, in addition to carrying out the actions and monitoring expressed in its action plan, Edison monitors its consumption by reporting the following KPIs (on data recorded by flow meters installed at the plant inlet and/or outlet): Litres of water consumed to produce energy compared to kWh of net electricity production (thermal and electrical) - equal to 0.3 l/kWh in 2024. C.2.4 Biodiversity and Ecosystems (E4) C.2.4.1 Introduction Edison recognises the conservation of ecosystems (dynamic complexes of plants, animals and microorganisms and their non-living environment interacting as a functional unit) and biodiversity (variability of life in terms of species and ecosystems), as well as the ecosystem services (life-supporting, regulatory, provisioning, cultural) associated with them as fundamental for the life of the Planet and the well-being of humankind. C.2.4.2 Management of IROs Related to Biodiversity and Ecosystems and their Interaction with the Strategy To date, Edison does not have a Biodiversity Transition Plan, but, aware of its role as a responsible energy operator, it implements operational models to manage and mitigate its impacts by taking a proactive approach. Specifically, in order to orient its “Road to nature” from a methodological perspective, and consolidate the resilience of its strategy and business model concerning nature, Edison bases its actions on the ACT-D framework (the acronym stands for Assess - Commit - Transform and Disclose), promoted by the Capital Coalition2, progressively implementing the LEAP approach as well (which stands for Locate, Evaluate - identify dependencies and impacts linked to nature, Assess - assess risks and opportunities, Prepare - prepare to manage them in an integrated manner in the Company’s strategy) promoted by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This way of acting is also reflected in the methodology illustrated in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) document ""Roadmap to Nature Positive → Foundations for the energy system"". Therefore, the first step (Locate) carried out by Edison was to identify the Company's main sectors and sub-sectors and, with reference to the electricity generation sector, verify the location of sites in terms of their proximity to sensitive areas 2 A global network of companies, organisations and financial institutions committed to the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework; namely, reversing biodiversity loss by 2050 and contributing to ecosystem restoration."
"2024 Financial Report Management, Sustainability and Governance Report Consolidated financial statements Separate financial statements 139 as far as biodiversity is concerned (an activity carried out as part of the ""Analysis of the ecological vulnerability and biodiversity risk"" that Edison has been conducting since 2020 and which it updates periodically, on more than 250 electricity generation plants). Subsequently, in order to initially identify the dependencies associated with ecosystem services (Evaluate - Assess) and specific by technology, also with reference to the key parts of the value chain (ref. C.1.1.3), Edison referred to the WBCS guidelines mentioned above which, in turn, refer to the ENCORE - Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure database. This analysis was enhanced with specific data relating to both the location of its plants and the annual reporting of resources employed by the business, where available, to finalize the assessment of material impacts and dependencies. The main factors that directly bring about changes in biodiversity and ecosystems are listed and commented on below: - Climate change: governed and addressed in the specific ESRS E1. - Pollution: governed and addressed in the specific ESRS E2. - Change in land use (understood as a change in the use of a specific area for a specific purpose - in Edison's case, for example, industrial): assessed as part of the authorisation process for the construction and operation of plants. It should be noted that the Company's assets are constructed based on specific deeds issued by the authority or authorising body that also take into consideration local and energy planning; therefore, the intended use defined at the relevant level depending on the plant (in force at the time or modified and authorised to this end) is respected. Depending on the type and size, more or less limited portions of land can be covered; in the case of wind power plants, on the other hand, complete reconstruction work decreases land use. - Change of use of fresh water and sea water: no reportable impact. - Direct exploitation of organisms and invasive alien species: no reportable impact. Regarding the involvement of the public in the electricity generation plant authorisation processes, in most cases subject to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Integrated Environmental Authorisation (IEA) processes, the law aims at transparency and engagement to ensure that citizens are informed about the impacts of initiatives and have the opportunity to actively participate in decisions that affect their local area through public consultations and/or access to documents. The process ends with the Services Conference where opinions and any further monitoring/control/mitigation activities to be integrated by the companies during the construction and/or operation phase are collected from all public institutions in the area involved in the process. The EIA measure then contains requirements regarding environmental impact not only during plant operation, but also during its construction and decommissioning, specifying the measures of the Monitoring and Control Plan (mentioned in the previous ESRS). Thanks to the activities carried out for the above and the Environmental Management Systems and others that Edison voluntarily adopts, in 2022 - and with periodic updates - it decided to carry out a survey called “BES Best Practices: Best Practices for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services”, which led to the identification of more than 30 internal best practices for managing environmental aspects closely related to nature within the main processes of planning, implementation and"

The entire processes described contributed to the information base which, together with other elements, as described in sub-section C.1.3.2, led to the identification of four material impacts (two positive and two negative) and one financial risk. Financial risk is related to the non-energy site regeneration activities of the newly founded Edison Regea. In fact, as the assignee of the Montedison Group, Edison is involved in various environmental proceedings, the subject of which is the environmental remediation of contaminated or presumed contaminated areas. In collaboration with Greenthesis and ACR Reggiani, already in 2021 Edison and Edison Next Environment created Tre Monti, specialising in the remediation of soil and groundwater from the Tremonti landfill in the SNI (Site of National Interest) of Bussi sul Tirino. From July 2024, the reclamation work has been carried out by the new Edison Group company Regea Srl, like for all 37 sites spread over a total area of 705 hectares. Lastly, it should be noted that the Group has not identified any significant negative impacts on soil degradation or desertification, nor has it identified any effects on endangered species."
