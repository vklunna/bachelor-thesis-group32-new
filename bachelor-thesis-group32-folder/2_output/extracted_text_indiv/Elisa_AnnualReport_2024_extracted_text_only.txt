"Physical climate risks for Elisa’s operations In line with climate hazards, we do not estimate the physical climate risks to be significant for Elisa’s operations in the short term. However, we anticipate potential effects of physical climate risks for our own operations over the longer term. Physical climate risks, description and its management Physical risk type Description Management Acute Acute risks would likely be caused by storms (including blizzards, dust storms and sandstorms) especially effecting Elisa’s data centres and network operations in Finland and Estonia. Reliable power supply is of utmost importance for Elisa’s data centre and network operations, which are located at thousands of sites all across Finland and Estonia. Extreme weather events, such as forest fires, storms and floods, can potentially cause power outages or physical damage. Elisa has a societal obligation to provide reliable connectivity services, and interruptions can lead to loss of income as well as loss reputational damage, so we take measures to handle situations with, for example, base station towers. An increase in extreme weather events could result in higher costs related to personnel and broken equipment. Elisa utilises a comprehensive real-time system for monitoring and rapidly identifying network disturbances. Also, in the planning phase, we already aim to mitigate risks related to physical infrastructure. Additionally, Elisa acts in close collaboration with necessary stakeholders, such as electricity distribution companies in the event of power outages. Joint development, redundant power systems, exercises with stakeholders, as well as insurance or other agreements, are examples of pre-emptively managing risks. Chronic Chronic risks would likely be caused by the effects of rising average temperatures, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, where Elisa’s network and data centre business is located. Correct operating temperatures for equipment are important to avoid any technical failures and related service disruptions, so rising average temperatures might increase operating costs for cooling. The effects on Elisa’s international operations in digital services outside of Northern Europe mainly concern office premises, which might be affected mainly by increased costs for air conditioning. Ensuring sufficient cooling, especially for mobile network base stations and data centres, will, over time, require higher investments in cooling solutions for equipment and increase operating costs. The effects on employee health of rising average temperatures and related heatwaves should also be considered. Frequent heatwaves might increase direct operating costs due to higher energy costs and maintenance requirements, but the magnitude of the impact is estimated to be low. To mitigate these effects, we work continuously to improve energy efficiency and the design of the facilities, and we collaborate with procurement and with suppliers accordingly. 61 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Transitional climate risks for Elisa’s operations We have identified the following transitional risks in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe, over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons: Transitional climate risks, description and its management Risk type Description Management Increasing costs due to markets, regulations, and energy taxes. Elisa has addressed energy risks as part of its strategy since 2009, and it mitigates these risks by continuous improvements in energy efficiency and using carbon-free electricity. EU legislation can also be a key driver for increased energy efficiency through carbon taxation mechanisms. Elisa's main markets are in the EU (Finland and Estonia), which may see further requirements to both cut and compensate for emissions through new taxes or more comprehensive and higher carbon pricing. If these developments are realised, they will have an impact on Elisa’s operational costs through higher energy prices, carbon taxes, and voluntary (or even mandatory) compensation. A carbon tax might also affect the costs of purchased goods and services when suppliers try to cover their own development costs. Elisa has been proactively improving energy efficiency in its mobile networks, data centres, telefacilities and other premises for over a decade. The energy consumption of networks constitutes over 90 percent of Elisa's total energy consumption. At the same time, it is expected that Elisa’s energy consumption will grow, despite energy efficiency measures, due to increased data usage. Elisa has been using carbon-free electricity since 2014. Centralised energy procurement improves effectiveness and value, for instance through our ten-year wind farm power purchasing agreement. Stakeholders expecting concrete actions from the ICT industry Extreme events caused by climate change are increasing environmental awareness among Elisa's stakeholders in general. Both employees and customers expect Elisa to deliver high performance in sustainability and environmental responsibility. We see increasing interest among customers, investors and authorities in the environmental performance of companies, and we aim for a high level of commitment and transparency. Elisa keeps up a transparent climate dialogue with essential stakeholders, as confusion about sustainability issues among consumers might lead to less demand for existing products. Digitalisation requires well-functioning network infrastructure that runs on electricity, as well as devices that are manufactured from raw materials, and Elisa is actively promoting resource efficiency in these areas. Dependency on value chain commitment to climate targets Elisa is dependent on a complex value chain, including in climate transition. An overwhelming part of Elisa’s environmental impact comes through indirect supply chain GHG emissions, where devices and equipment that are needed to use and provide our services are manufactured. Equipment-related emissions are generated in Elisa’s upstream supply chain, more specifically in Scope 3 from the categories Purchased goods and services and Capital goods. Elisa's stakeholder groups expect high performance in environmental sustainability, and they increasingly demand transparent climate reporting; however, many suppliers do not yet have the readiness to support this through life-cycle assessments of the products and services they provided. Furthermore, increased product development needs might create pressure for suppliers to increase prices to recoup their investment. To achieve Elisa's ambitious near- and long-term climate transition targets, we have raised awareness and engaged with key suppliers around climate change mitigation. Naturally, also stakeholders in direct operations and downstream in the value chain must be closely involved in such efforts. 62 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Climate change adaptation and energy-related opportunities Climate change has been part of Elisa’s strategy, since 2009. Our experience enables us to help our customers in creation of a more sustainable future through digitalisation. We see opportunities in tackling climate challenges by developing new business innovations in sustainability. For instance, our International Digital Services is built on our expertise in automation and digitalisation. Elisa offers an IoT platform with advanced machine learning and predictive analysis capabilities. This technology can be used also to better manage energy efficiency and other relevant parameters of buildings. Furthermore, Elisa’s AI-driven software helps ramp up production quickly and sustainably by identifying issues and optimising energy use. Our Distributed Energy Solution (DES) transforms radio access networks into virtual power plants, using AI to efficiently manage energy by controlling the charging and discharging of batteries. DES also has the capability of providing grid-balancing services to transmission system operators (TSOs). This helps in addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy sources. In Finland, Elisa utilises DES to participate in the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve, providing grid-balancing services to Fingrid, the national TSO. Transition plan for climate change mitigation Elisa has committed to the Paris Agreement to keep global warming to 1.5°C. In 2023, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for Elisa’s updated near-term science-based target, and we are the first listed company in Finland to set a long-term net-zero target. On our ambitious journey towards Net-zero in 2040, we are currently focusing on Elisa’s 2030 near-term climate target of a 42 percent absolute reduction in GHG emissions in all our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions compared to the base year of 2021. We publicly share a high-level overview of Elisa’s climate transition planning on our website. Elisa’s climate targets are reviewed by Elisa’s BOD and approved by CEB. These targets have been communicated to internal and external stakeholders. The Elisa Climate Transition Plan (CTP) is a roadmap towards low carbon business in Elisa’s own operations as well as its chain of activities. Through CTP and more concrete Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), we drive our ambitious near-term and long- term climate targets. This takes a long-term commitment of continuous improvement in carbon emission reduction and creates the foundation for climate actions over the three-year strategy period for 2025–2027. The CTP is integrated to Elisa’s environmental management system (EMS) and energy management system (EnMS). Scope 1 and 2 emissions are responsible for about 1percent of Elisa’s total carbon emissions, resulting Scope 3 emission to be 99 percent and thus having the material impact. From Scope 3 emissions, our own operations (waste generated, business travel and employee commuting) result in only 2 percent while the remaining are from Elisa’s value chain. Therefore, supply chain engagement and collaboration are crucial to drive our climate targets and keep within planetary boundaries. In 2024, Elisa launched its responsible supplier financing, which is a working capital financing solution offered by Elisa together with its finance partner. Material efficiency is enabled mainly through circular economy solutions. To reduce the amount of waste in our operations, we repair, refurbish and reuse when feasible, and we responsibly recycle equipment at the end of its lifespan. We also offer device repair and refurbishment services to our customers, as well as specific circular economy business models, like devices-as-a-service. Energy efficiency has been part of our operational development and monitored on a strategic level since 2009. By the end of 2024, we had improved our energy efficiency in mobile data transfers by 71percent since 2016. Similarly, Elisa’s carbon footprint from Scope 1 and 2 emissions had decreased by more than 80 percent compared to 2016. In some cases, we have been able to productise innovations that we have created to address energy efficiency in our own operations, making them part of the sustainable solutions we offer to customers. Energy efficiency initiatives throughout Elisa’s operations receive substantial continuous investments i.e. through modernisation. Also, Elisa’s first circular economy initiatives, in the form of building repair and refurbishment capabilities, have received significant investments. The latter is also reported according to EU Taxonomy regulations. Elisa does not have a high-emissions infrastructure as we use only carbon-free electricity for our telecom networks and data centres. Elisa thus has very few assets with locked-in GHG emissions other than backup power generators, which use fossil fuels but are difficult to phase out due to regulatory resilience requirements. In Elisa’s annual strategy process, the results of the double materiality assessment are utilised to identify the environme­ ntal issues important to the business. The strategic sustaina­ bility targets are part of Elisa’s high-level strategic action plan (Key Means), each owned by a designated member of CEB. These members, along with the appointed strategy leads, are responsible for ensuring that the necessary actions, goals, and resources are in place to achieve the targets within the agreed timelines. This approach ensures ownership, delegation, sufficient resources for implementation, and regular monitoring of the strategic action plan’s execution that support the target. The strategy owners and leads are responsible for reporting on performance to the relevant Elisa stakeholders. In Elisa’s annual strategy process, the environ­ mental issues important to the business are reviewed. CRMB approves EMS as well as monitors and guides the CTAP. Elisa’s relevant businesses are responsible for setting adequate actions according to CTAP. EMS development and CTAP follow up is maintained by domain experts in the Elisa Environment and Energy Working Group (EEWG). The EEWG tracks progress in implementing the CTAP, as part of the regular management of both the EMS and EnMS. The CRMB reviews the performance regularly. 63 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

"ESRS E1 Climate change Policies Elisa has set Group-level policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Elisa Code of Conduct sets the foundation for our ethical business behaviour. Elisa’s Environmental Policy describes our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our business in our own operations and chain of activities. Similarly, Elisa’s Energy Policy describes our goal to sustainably improving energy performance. Additionally, Elisa Code of Ethical Purchasing describes the ethical and legal duties and responsibilities of our suppliers. Elisa complies with all applicable environmental and climate legislation and regulations and requires all the stakeholders in its operations and chain of activities to similarly comply with them. Elisa’s Environmental and Energy Policy adhere to the principles and reporting guidelines of the CSRD, the UN Global Compact, and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These policies are approved by Elisa’s Corporate Responsibility Management Board (CRMB). These policies are publicly available and accessible applying to every employee in Elisa and all third parties acting on behalf of Elisa. We require our suppliers, subcontractors, and external partners to comply with these or similar principles. The policies provide clear guidance on responsible practices and outlines commitments and strategies for achieving envi­ ronmental sustainability and addressing climate change within Elisa’s global operations. It addresses Elisa’s commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy and resource efficiency, and circularity. Through sustainable actions and the development of innovative solutions, Elisa aims to significantly reduce both its own carbon footprint and those of its customers. Our approach As a part of double materiality assessment (DMA), Elisa has evaluated impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. The material negative impacts lie both in our upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Elisa’s previous climate scenarios work was utilised as part of our DMA, and it is addressed while creating financial statements. Through this work, Elisa has identified physical and transitional climate risks, which pose impacts for Elisa’s operations over different time horizons. Climate change resilience analysis has been conducted for the whole Elisa group of companies and key supplier categories. In the analysis, we assess which of Elisa’s locations of operation have physical climate change vulnerabilities. For such identified locations, we further assess the risks and potential impacts, on which we base the development of strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Our climate change resilience analysis was revisited in 2024. When conducting our resilience analysis, we identify factors that apply to Elisa’s operations over the short, medium and long term. Based on our resilience analysis locations of operation in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe will not be signifi­ cantly affected by climate change in the short term. We have identified that Elisa has operations in areas with, for example, water scarcity vulnerabilities. Drought does not have direct impact on Elisa’s operations in short term. We use resilience analysis findings in Elisa’s Climate Transition Plan, to ensure alignment with related strategic and tactical actions across the organisation. It also has implications to financial planning. Elisa’s dependencies on the value chain, and especially the supply chain and its performance in climate transition, impacts on risks and, to some degree, on opportunities, as well as our corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As an organisation, we are continuing our work on mitigating global warming by reducing our carbon footprint, to ensure actions for target of a 1.5°C global average temperature rise, while simultaneously adapting operations for a scenario of up to 3°C. We already see that regulation is a key driver of ambitious environmental targets for European companies, not only for climate, but also in aligning with planetary boundaries overall. We aim for solid, longer-term strategies that integrate sustainability with Elisa’s digital business operations, enabling us to respond to emerging issues in an increasingly complex and unpredictable world. For the same reasons, we are continuing to experiment to drive rapid learning and innovation. Potential climate-related hazards in Elisa’s operations We have identified the following climate-related hazards in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe, over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons: Short term (0–2 years) • Extreme weather events, such as severe winter storms • Flooding of vulnerable locations during heavy rainfall • Wildfires becoming more intense and frequent Medium term (3–5 years) • Longer heatwaves and extreme temperature events • Increased precipitation and seasonally heavy rainfall Long term (over 5 years) • Droughts becoming more frequent and prolonged • Rising sea levels, leading to coastal erosion and flooding 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

"ESRS E1 Climate change Policies Elisa has set Group-level policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Elisa Code of Conduct sets the foundation for our ethical business behaviour. Elisa’s Environmental Policy describes our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our business in our own operations and chain of activities. Similarly, Elisa’s Energy Policy describes our goal to sustainably improving energy performance. Additionally, Elisa Code of Ethical Purchasing describes the ethical and legal duties and responsibilities of our suppliers. Elisa complies with all applicable environmental and climate legislation and regulations and requires all the stakeholders in its operations and chain of activities to similarly comply with them. Elisa’s Environmental and Energy Policy adhere to the principles and reporting guidelines of the CSRD, the UN Global Compact, and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These policies are approved by Elisa’s Corporate Responsibility Management Board (CRMB). These policies are publicly available and accessible applying to every employee in Elisa and all third parties acting on behalf of Elisa. We require our suppliers, subcontractors, and external partners to comply with these or similar principles. The policies provide clear guidance on responsible practices and outlines commitments and strategies for achieving envi­ ronmental sustainability and addressing climate change within Elisa’s global operations. It addresses Elisa’s commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy and resource efficiency, and circularity. Through sustainable actions and the development of innovative solutions, Elisa aims to significantly reduce both its own carbon footprint and those of its customers. Our approach As a part of double materiality assessment (DMA), Elisa has evaluated impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. The material negative impacts lie both in our upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Elisa’s previous climate scenarios work was utilised as part of our DMA, and it is addressed while creating financial statements. Through this work, Elisa has identified physical and transitional climate risks, which pose impacts for Elisa’s operations over different time horizons. Climate change resilience analysis has been conducted for the whole Elisa group of companies and key supplier categories. In the analysis, we assess which of Elisa’s locations of operation have physical climate change vulnerabilities. For such identified locations, we further assess the risks and potential impacts, on which we base the development of strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Our climate change resilience analysis was revisited in 2024. When conducting our resilience analysis, we identify factors that apply to Elisa’s operations over the short, medium and long term. Based on our resilience analysis locations of operation in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe will not be signifi­ cantly affected by climate change in the short term. We have identified that Elisa has operations in areas with, for example, water scarcity vulnerabilities. Drought does not have direct impact on Elisa’s operations in short term. We use resilience analysis findings in Elisa’s Climate Transition Plan, to ensure alignment with related strategic and tactical actions across the organisation. It also has implications to financial planning. Elisa’s dependencies on the value chain, and especially the supply chain and its performance in climate transition, impacts on risks and, to some degree, on opportunities, as well as our corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As an organisation, we are continuing our work on mitigating global warming by reducing our carbon footprint, to ensure actions for target of a 1.5°C global average temperature rise, while simultaneously adapting operations for a scenario of up to 3°C. We already see that regulation is a key driver of ambitious environmental targets for European companies, not only for climate, but also in aligning with planetary boundaries overall. We aim for solid, longer-term strategies that integrate sustainability with Elisa’s digital business operations, enabling us to respond to emerging issues in an increasingly complex and unpredictable world. For the same reasons, we are continuing to experiment to drive rapid learning and innovation. Potential climate-related hazards in Elisa’s operations We have identified the following climate-related hazards in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe, over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons: Short term (0–2 years) • Extreme weather events, such as severe winter storms • Flooding of vulnerable locations during heavy rainfall • Wildfires becoming more intense and frequent Medium term (3–5 years) • Longer heatwaves and extreme temperature events • Increased precipitation and seasonally heavy rainfall Long term (over 5 years) • Droughts becoming more frequent and prolonged • Rising sea levels, leading to coastal erosion and flooding 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Physical climate risks for Elisa’s operations In line with climate hazards, we do not estimate the physical climate risks to be significant for Elisa’s operations in the short term. However, we anticipate potential effects of physical climate risks for our own operations over the longer term. Physical climate risks, description and its management Physical risk type Description Management Acute Acute risks would likely be caused by storms (including blizzards, dust storms and sandstorms) especially effecting Elisa’s data centres and network operations in Finland and Estonia. Reliable power supply is of utmost importance for Elisa’s data centre and network operations, which are located at thousands of sites all across Finland and Estonia. Extreme weather events, such as forest fires, storms and floods, can potentially cause power outages or physical damage. Elisa has a societal obligation to provide reliable connectivity services, and interruptions can lead to loss of income as well as loss reputational damage, so we take measures to handle situations with, for example, base station towers. An increase in extreme weather events could result in higher costs related to personnel and broken equipment. Elisa utilises a comprehensive real-time system for monitoring and rapidly identifying network disturbances. Also, in the planning phase, we already aim to mitigate risks related to physical infrastructure. Additionally, Elisa acts in close collaboration with necessary stakeholders, such as electricity distribution companies in the event of power outages. Joint development, redundant power systems, exercises with stakeholders, as well as insurance or other agreements, are examples of pre-emptively managing risks. Chronic Chronic risks would likely be caused by the effects of rising average temperatures, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, where Elisa’s network and data centre business is located. Correct operating temperatures for equipment are important to avoid any technical failures and related service disruptions, so rising average temperatures might increase operating costs for cooling. The effects on Elisa’s international operations in digital services outside of Northern Europe mainly concern office premises, which might be affected mainly by increased costs for air conditioning. Ensuring sufficient cooling, especially for mobile network base stations and data centres, will, over time, require higher investments in cooling solutions for equipment and increase operating costs. The effects on employee health of rising average temperatures and related heatwaves should also be considered. Frequent heatwaves might increase direct operating costs due to higher energy costs and maintenance requirements, but the magnitude of the impact is estimated to be low. To mitigate these effects, we work continuously to improve energy efficiency and the design of the facilities, and we collaborate with procurement and with suppliers accordingly. 61 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Transitional climate risks for Elisa’s operations We have identified the following transitional risks in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe, over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons: Transitional climate risks, description and its management Risk type Description Management Increasing costs due to markets, regulations, and energy taxes. Elisa has addressed energy risks as part of its strategy since 2009, and it mitigates these risks by continuous improvements in energy efficiency and using carbon-free electricity. EU legislation can also be a key driver for increased energy efficiency through carbon taxation mechanisms. Elisa's main markets are in the EU (Finland and Estonia), which may see further requirements to both cut and compensate for emissions through new taxes or more comprehensive and higher carbon pricing. If these developments are realised, they will have an impact on Elisa’s operational costs through higher energy prices, carbon taxes, and voluntary (or even mandatory) compensation. A carbon tax might also affect the costs of purchased goods and services when suppliers try to cover their own development costs. Elisa has been proactively improving energy efficiency in its mobile networks, data centres, telefacilities and other premises for over a decade. The energy consumption of networks constitutes over 90 percent of Elisa's total energy consumption. At the same time, it is expected that Elisa’s energy consumption will grow, despite energy efficiency measures, due to increased data usage. Elisa has been using carbon-free electricity since 2014. Centralised energy procurement improves effectiveness and value, for instance through our ten-year wind farm power purchasing agreement. Stakeholders expecting concrete actions from the ICT industry Extreme events caused by climate change are increasing environmental awareness among Elisa's stakeholders in general. Both employees and customers expect Elisa to deliver high performance in sustainability and environmental responsibility. We see increasing interest among customers, investors and authorities in the environmental performance of companies, and we aim for a high level of commitment and transparency. Elisa keeps up a transparent climate dialogue with essential stakeholders, as confusion about sustainability issues among consumers might lead to less demand for existing products. Digitalisation requires well-functioning network infrastructure that runs on electricity, as well as devices that are manufactured from raw materials, and Elisa is actively promoting resource efficiency in these areas. Dependency on value chain commitment to climate targets Elisa is dependent on a complex value chain, including in climate transition. An overwhelming part of Elisa’s environmental impact comes through indirect supply chain GHG emissions, where devices and equipment that are needed to use and provide our services are manufactured. Equipment-related emissions are generated in Elisa’s upstream supply chain, more specifically in Scope 3 from the categories Purchased goods and services and Capital goods. Elisa's stakeholder groups expect high performance in environmental sustainability, and they increasingly demand transparent climate reporting; however, many suppliers do not yet have the readiness to support this through life-cycle assessments of the products and services they provided. Furthermore, increased product development needs might create pressure for suppliers to increase prices to recoup their investment. To achieve Elisa's ambitious near- and long-term climate transition targets, we have raised awareness and engaged with key suppliers around climate change mitigation. Naturally, also stakeholders in direct operations and downstream in the value chain must be closely involved in such efforts. 62 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

"Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Description Performance Near-term climate target for 2030 In its near-term climate target for 2030, Elisa is committed to reducing absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent from the base year 2021. We will achieve this without using carbon credits or mitigation beyond the value chain. 1.8 percent decrease in the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions compared to the base year 2021. Net-zero target for 2040 In its long-term climate target for 2040, Elisa is committed to reducing absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent from the base year 2021. We will prioritise decarbonisation through direct emissions reductions, and all residual emissions will be neutralised in line with SBTi criteria before reaching net-zero emissions in 2040. Sustainability-related performance in incentive schemes We have defined how climate-related considerations are factored into incentives and remuneration for members of administrative, management and supervisory bodies. Incorporating carbon emission reduction targets to remune­ ration shows the importance of both executive and employee roles in achieving Elisa’s ambitious climate targets and other environmental commitments. Executives in supervisory bodies and employees in management and administrative bodies have important roles in achieving Elisa’s ambitious climate targets and other environmental commitments. Elisa’s climate targets are aligned with science based (SBTi) carbon emission reduction targets. The 2024 terms of Elisa’s employee fund included carbon dioxide reduction targets. The CEO’s short-term incentive plan for 2024 had an ESG goal focused on reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, we set a climate goal in the long-term incentive program, targeting the CEO, executive team members, and selected key personnel. This practically means reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 7 percent annually towards Elisa’s science-based short-term climate targets, aiming for a 42 percent reduction by 2030 from the 2021 baseline. For further information on the integration of sustainability-re­ lated performance in incentive schemes, see the section Sustainability governance. Elisa has committed to the Paris Agreement to keep global warming to 1.5°C. Elisa has set group-level science-based climate targets that are approved by the SBTi. On our journey towards Net-zero in 2040, we are currently focusing on our 2030 near-term climate target of 42 percent absolute reductions in all Scope 1, 2 and 3. The baseline for the targets is 2021. These two group-level targets are aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative environmental impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. The total Scope 3 emissions were still on a slightly upward trend at the end of 2024 compared to the base year, 2021. The largest emissions contributor are purchased goods and services, and capital goods. This shows the urgency of having focus on upstream value chain. Therefore, in the following years, we will continue to intensify our actions in the value chain to reduce the carbon emissions. 66 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Scope 3 (45.8% of total GHG reductions) Science-based climate targets of suppliers: • Climate targets of suppliers (58% of Scope 3, 26.8% of total GHG reductions) • Reuse of capital infrastructure (0.4% of Scope 3, 0.2% of total GHG reductions) Use of sold products: • Energy policy engagement and renewable infrastructure (20% of Scope 3, 9.1% of total GHG reductions) End-of-life of sold products: • Repair and refurbishment of devices (10% of Scope 3, 4.8% of total GHG reductions) Energy production: • Extra GoOs and switch to wind or solar GoOs (7% of Scope 3, 3.3% of total GHG reductions) Own operations: • Policy-based (4% of Scope 3, 1.7% of total GHG reductions) We have assessed that energy-related levers have low to medium complexity and medium-level continued investments.

"device circularity (marked as repair and refurbishment and disclosed in Taxonomy under CE 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing). The related capital expenditure data is reported in the EU Taxonomy section of this statement, and it is also included in the table below of significant capital and operational expenditures required for implementation of Elisa’s CTAP. For Elisa, the related capital expenditures are typically investments in energy efficiency of telecom infrastructure, and operational expenditures are, for example, carbon-free energy acquisition through Guarantees of Origin or Power Purchasing Agreements. These examples of expenditures are already part of well-established processes of continuous improvement in Elisa’s operations. Other areas are less mature, for example mitigation of risks from dependencies on supplier performance against their own climate targets, which can require additional resources in, for example, supplier engagement with incentives, setting policies that might result in price increases, and scaling up opportunities in the circular economy. We are still forming our understanding and approach in this area, and therefore we are not yet providing financial estimates of capital or operational expenditures for such planned actions. We see three clusters of levers in Elisa’s climate transition planning – energy, supply chain, and circular economy. These are aligned with and contribute to objectives of related policies and guidelines of Elisa, especially in the areas of environmental, energy and procurement. Specific levers, such as energy efficiency improvements in mobile networks or energy attribute certificates, consist of various actions taken during the reporting year, in different parts and geographies of the Elisa group or its value chain or with other stakehol­ ders. The key actions, summarised in the table, are mostly efforts of continuous improvement over several years, but they are all expected to have an outcome that contribute to the achievement of Elisa’s near-term climate targets in 2030. We have for the above list so far not recognised significant harm that is caused to external stakeholders from actions based on our climate transition planning but will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. We ensure consistency between climate transition targets and GHG inventory boundaries, meaning that relevant emission sources are accounted for in our reporting. This is accomp­ lished by clearly establishing organisational boundaries for Elisa’s GHG inventory, including relevant regions, facilities, assets and activities. We apply consistent methodologies and, increasingly, automation in calculating GHG emissions on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, we ensure that the continuous development of methodology is transpa­ rently documented, and that data is retroactively corrected, Financial resources allocated to the Climate Transition Action Plan in 2024 Instruments Climate actions, with scope and time horizons CapEx [mEUR] OpEx [mEUR] Energy efficiency Improvements in mobile and fixed networks, for example through modernisation of 4G and 5G, as well as transforming fixed legacy networks with the latest technology. Improvements in premises and data centres, for example through modernisation in cooling, optimisation, cloudification, automation, as well as in continuous development and operation of properties. New innovations and development of solutions, for example by using machine learning and AI, distributed energy storage, smart meters, as well as implementing and developing green coding. The key actions above, are development efforts that span over several years, mainly in Elisa’s telecom network operations on the home markets of Finland and Estonia. Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions of these actions often show already within the reporting year, but usually have a long-term impact. 136 1 Other climate actions Energy generation in own direct operations, energy attribute certificates and agreements, supplier engagement for material efficiency, as well as research and beyond value chain mitigation. The key actions above, are development efforts that span over several years, and cover operations in different parts and geographies of the Elisa group or its value chain. Scope 3 emission reductions of these actions increasingly show towards Elisa’s near-term climate targets in 2030, while Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions are usually immediate. 0 3 if necessary. We have built a robust ESG data management system for the management and reporting of GHG emissions, and we have developed capabilities for scenario analyses of various emission reduction lever impacts. It is important to engage with suppliers, in particular, to drive a level of transparency that is necessary for an increasingly granular analysis of Elisa’s GHG inventory. Elisa’s first near-term target was approved by the SBTi in 2018 and was updated in 2023, including setting a new base year of 2021. Past progress made in meeting climate targets before this is available from Elisa’s annual reports. The baseline values set are based on Elisa’s assured and publicly available ESG reporting. Elisa’s international expansion poses some degree of challenge regarding this baseline, as new company acquisitions increase the boundaries of our GHG inventory to some degree. Baseline values are adjusted at the latest in updated target-setting every five years, according to SBTi guidelines. The related calculation methodology ensures that such targets remain compatible with global warming of 1.5°C. Through our double-materiality assessment (DMA), we, for example, identify parameters in Elisa’s contextual environment that can highly affect operations. We conduct structured analyses of, for example, technology-related roadmaps, Elisa’s competitors, and various other market factors, provided by our market intelligence experts. We continuously engage with stakeholders that are either impacted by our operations or have an impact on business strategy or operations, such as customers, employees, investors, regulators and suppliers. We also acknowledge the important perspectives of, for instance brought up by local communities and NGOs. Our scenario analysis accounts for both physical and transitional risks, based on various information sources. In addition to climate scenarios for geographical areas of our 68 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"operations, we analyse climate extremes and future changes in climate over the next three decades. We have utilised information sources and tools that consider climate chan­ ge-related factors that are the most relevant for our operations including flooding, severe storms and wildfire hazards. We also cover the susceptibility of society to climate change. According to this analysis, both Finland and Estonia have relatively low climate change exposures and vulnerabilities, but some of our international offices have higher risks in some areas. GHG removal and mitigation projects Elisa’s long-term goals (Net-zero 2040) allow us, in accordance with the recommendation of the SBTi initiative, to use only removal-type carbon credit projects for neutralisation of carbon emissions. This means that, at most, 10 percent of emissions at that point can be covered by carbon removal through carbon credits. We prioritise abatement within our value chain, and we are continuously investigating ways to reduce carbon emissions together with various stakeholders. We are currently focused on our near-term, science-based target for 2030, with a 42 percent reduction in all scopes of emissions. We will not use carbon credits for near-term target. Elisa is nevertheless already investing in additional mitigation actions beyond the near- and long-term science-based targets. Currently, Elisa has not developed any projects in its own operations or value chain for GHG emission removal or storage, but as part of Elisa’s CTP, we are exploring oppor­ tunities in this area. However, Elisa adopted the practice of beyond-value-chain mitigation already in 2020, with the scope of annually acquiring carbon credits in an amount equal to the remaining emissions in our own operations, meaning from fuels (Scope 1) and a small portion of other energy usage (Scope 2), as well as from waste and from business travel and employee commuting, including remote working (Scope 3). Beyond-value-chain mitigation thus comprises a valuable aspect in building the sustainable service offering that Elisa provides to its customers. Our selected carbon credit projects also have co-benefits for people and nature. Over time, Elisa has built a carbon credit portfolio with a variety of high-quality projects of different types and on different continents, according to the following motivations: • Mitigate risks with a well-balanced portfolio • Predictability for high-quality carbon credits • Benefit financially from strategic procurement • Adress Elisa’s geographical value chain impacts • Test and learn about available opportunities to support our transition When reviewing, deciding, and procuring carbon credits, we do due diligence as follows: • Additionality: The project reduces carbon emissions that are not reduced through other initiatives. • Leakage prevention: Emission reductions from the project do not leak to other locations or activities. • Permanence: The project permanently prevents the carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. • Verifiability: An objective third party confirms that emission reductions from the project are credible. • Other risk assessment: The project e.g. avoids very high-risk countries. Elisa purchased carbon credits from projects that are of high quality, verified by standard bodies like Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The methodologies of these standards ensure accurate quantification and verification for various mitigation technologies and processes. To further lessen risks in the quality of carbon credits, we do additional vetting to the extent possible together with selected partners. We follow developments in methodologies and actively engage in dialogue with providers and other experts or stakeholders, to continuously develop Elisa’s carbon credit portfolio. 69 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

This means that, at most, 10 percent of emissions at that point can be covered by carbon removal through carbon credits. We prioritise abatement within our value chain, and we are continuously investigating ways to reduce carbon emissions together with various stakeholders. We are currently focused on our near-term, science-based target for 2030, with a 42 percent reduction in all scopes of emissions. We will not use carbon credits for near-term target. Elisa is nevertheless already investing in additional mitigation actions beyond the near- and long-term science-based targets. Currently, Elisa has not developed any projects in its own operations or value chain for GHG emission removal or storage, but as part of Elisa’s CTP, we are exploring oppor­ tunities in this area. However, Elisa adopted the practice of beyond-value-chain mitigation already in 2020, with the scope of annually acquiring carbon credits in an amount equal to the remaining emissions in our own operations, meaning from fuels (Scope 1) and a small portion of other energy usage (Scope 2), as well as from waste and from business travel and employee commuting, including remote working (Scope 3). Beyond-value-chain mitigation thus comprises a valuable aspect in building the sustainable service offering that Elisa provides to its customers. Our selected carbon credit projects also have co-benefits for people and nature. Over time, Elisa has built a carbon credit portfolio with a variety of high-quality projects of different types and on different continents, according to the following motivations: • Mitigate risks with a well-balanced portfolio • Predictability for high-quality carbon credits • Benefit financially from strategic procurement • Adress Elisa’s geographical value chain impacts • Test and learn about available opportunities to support our transition When reviewing, deciding, and procuring carbon credits, we do due diligence as follows: • Additionality: The project reduces carbon emissions that are not reduced through other initiatives. • Leakage prevention: Emission reductions from the project do not leak to other locations or activities. • Permanence: The project permanently prevents the carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. • Verifiability: An objective third party confirms that emission reductions from the project are credible. • Other risk assessment: The project e.g. avoids very high-risk countries. Elisa purchased carbon credits from projects that are of high quality, verified by standard bodies like Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The methodologies of these standards ensure accurate quantification and verification for various mitigation technologies and processes. To further lessen risks in the quality of carbon credits, we do additional vetting to the extent possible together with selected partners. We follow developments in methodologies and actively engage in dialogue with providers and other experts or stakeholders, to continuously develop Elisa’s carbon credit portfolio. 69 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Carbon credit portfolio in 2024 Project name Project type Short project description Quality standard and project ID American BioCarbon biochar (USA) Removal (Oxford Category 5) Technical carbon sink American BioCarbon produces biochar in Louisiana, USA, making beneficial use of agricultural waste from the sugar cane industry (bagasse). Alongside pure carbon removal benefits, the project also produces clean energy as well as biochar, which can be used as a soil amendment. By taking an abundant, biogenic waste material and converting it to biochar, carbon dioxide is locked out of the atmosphere. Puro.earth Puro-543800 San Jerónimo Coatlán (Mexico) Removal (Oxford Category 4) Biogenic carbon sink San Jerónimo Coatlán is a rural and partly indigenous community located in the south of Oaxaca, Mexico. The land is communally owned, and for the last 20 years the community has forests communally to produce pine and oak wood. The project enables the community to invest in forest restoration and reforestation, as well as maintain a forestry ranger service to control wildfires and plagues and invest in social projects to improve health and water access for the population. Climate Action Reserve CAR1829 Borneo peatlands (Indonesia) Reduction (Oxford Category 2) Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan) encompasses approximately 5.7 million hectares of peatland. The project is protecting and restoring 149,800 hectares of peatland ecosystems, covering one of Indonesia’s largest remaining intact peat swamp forests, and is reforesting 4,433 hectares of non-forest areas within the project area. The project also protects wildlife and improves livelihoods for the community located in the area. Verified Carbon Standard VCS 1477 Keio Seima (Cambodia) Reduction (Oxford Category 2) The Seima Protection Forest covers 292,690 hectares and is located in eastern Cambodia, mainly in Mondulkiri Province, with a small area extending into Kratie Province. The REDD project area covers 166,983 hectares of forest. The project is an Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) project under the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) project category. The project also protects wildlife and improves livelihoods for the community located in the area. Verified Carbon Standard VCS 1650 Rimba Raya (Indonesia) Reduction (Oxford Category 2) The project protects the Rimba Raya area in south-eastern Borneo, Indonesia from deforestation. For decades, Borneo has been suffering from deforestation, and its remaining rainforests are threatened with disappearance due to logging (including illegal logging), mineral mining and palm oil production. The reserve covers 64,000 hectares and provides a habitat for hundreds of species, including the endangered Bornean orangutan. Verified Carbon Standard VCS 674 Elisa’s portfolio for beyond-value-chain mitigation currently consists of both reduction and removal projects. As described below, Elisa’s active carbon credit portfolio, from which cancellations have been done for the reporting year, included removal-type projects from Oxford Category 4 (forest restoration/reforestation) and Category 5 (biochar), together with reduction-type projects: We see additional value also in innovation and dialogue directly with project developers and are for example supporting initiatives such as solar cooker systems for village communities in Zambia and mangrove plantations in Indonesia and the Philippines. We transparently describe all carbon credit projects in our portfolio, their cancellations, and related climate and other benefits, further on Elisa’s sustainability webpages. 70 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

Elisa reports both location-based and market-based figures. Location-based emissions for electricity consumption are calculated by using the three-year average for the total supplier mix from the latest European Residual Mix reports. For companies outside the EU, country-specific data is used, when available. In cases where country-specific data is not available, global averages are used. Market-based electricity calculations are performed using the three-year average for the residual mix from the latest European Residual Mix reports. For companies outside the EU, country-specific data is used, when available. If country-specific data is not available, global averages are used. When available, country-specific factors are used for heating and cooling. When not available, heating and cooling heating factors from the latest UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) report is used. Elisa’s core market retail sale of information and communica­ tion equipment is categorised as high climate impact sector G47.4. We do not separate this activity in Elisa’s financial statements. The total energy consumption of Elisa companies relative to revenue (energy intensity) is derived from Elisa’s total energy consumption reported in table ‘Total energy consumption in 2024’ divided by the total revenue of the Elisa group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Elisa reports all the material categories of Scope 3 emission as listed in table Gross GHG emission under significant Scope 3 emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The materiality of the specific categories and companies are based on euro-based threshold. Where the data exceeds the threshold, it is reported under relevant categories. The data used in Scope 3 are obtained either directly from Elisa’s internal systems or from third-party partner reports. Where it is possible to obtain product- and supplier-specific CO2 coefficients, they are used. For example, emissions from electronic products are calculated using supplier- and product-specific factors (e.g.: Apple products, laptops, etc.), and upstream transportation is calculated using supplier-spe­ cific emission factors. When not available, we use the general average or industry-specific factors (e.g: Defra’s emission factors, emission factors from the LIPASTO transport emission database or the average of different life cycle assessment research). 0.12 percent of emissions are calculated based on primary emission data provided directly by the suppliers. Six GHG emission categories are excluded from the calculation – upstream leased assets, downstream transportation, processing of sold products, downstream leased assets, franchising and investments – as they were assessed to be non-material. Elisa does not have significant leased assets under Scope 3 that are not already included in Scopes 1 and 2. Energy consumption at rented sites as well as energy consumption of other operators with leases is calculated and reported in Scope 2. Elisa does not engage in franchising, and emissions from investment and processing of sold products are not relevant. Emissions from downstream transportation are included in the upstream transportation categories. Due to Elisa’s growing international footprint, the boundaries of our reporting and data include new acquisitions made in 2024. Elisa continuously develops its measurements, which may imply changes in the data beyond business or operational changes. In 2024, we thoroughly developed our data collection and management processes and prioritised primary data over secondary estimated or assumed data, resulting in an overall enhancement in data quality. These improvements are noticeable, for example, indirect energy and scope 3 purchased services. Further, we have kept GHG emission factors in Scopes 1 and 2 up to date according to sources provided by third parties. Additionally, we have also updated our GHG emission factors based on the latest available knowledge for Scope 3 emissions. Elisa’s emission impact relative to revenue (emission intensity) is derived from the total emissions of Elisa companies reported in table ‘Total GHG emissions’ divided by the total revenue of the group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Accounting principles – Greenhouse gas emissions Elisa’s energy consumption and GHG emissions include data from all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. GHG emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Elisa takes general principles of calculations into account in its calculations. The boundaries of the calculation are defined so that they best correspond to Elisa’s operations. Reporting covers direct GHG emissions (Scope 1), indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) and upstream and downstream value chain emissions from relevant categories in Scope 3. Direct energy includes fuels, oils and gas purchased by Elisa for its use in mobile (such as company cars) or stationary sources (such as heating systems or generators). Scope 1 emission calculations are based on Elisa’s direct energy consumption and relevant emission factors for each fuel type. The emission factors are derived from the latest Statistics Finland database. Indirect energy includes the consumption of procured heating, cooling and electricity in various facilities (such as office premises, shops, networks, etc.) that Elisa leases or owns. In general, consumption figures are obtained from the lessor (building management company), rental bills or relevant invoices. When the actual consumption is not available, the energy is calculated based on square meters and using facility-specific consumption intensity (kWh/m2). 74 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Scope Performance Key Actions Zero waste in capital goods deliveries (upstream) by 2030 Elisa group The Zero Waste 2030 target was defined, and the Environmental Policy of Elisa was updated accordingly in 2024, providing a foundation for coming work.

"device circularity (marked as repair and refurbishment and disclosed in Taxonomy under CE 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing). The related capital expenditure data is reported in the EU Taxonomy section of this statement, and it is also included in the table below of significant capital and operational expenditures required for implementation of Elisa’s CTAP. For Elisa, the related capital expenditures are typically investments in energy efficiency of telecom infrastructure, and operational expenditures are, for example, carbon-free energy acquisition through Guarantees of Origin or Power Purchasing Agreements. These examples of expenditures are already part of well-established processes of continuous improvement in Elisa’s operations. Other areas are less mature, for example mitigation of risks from dependencies on supplier performance against their own climate targets, which can require additional resources in, for example, supplier engagement with incentives, setting policies that might result in price increases, and scaling up opportunities in the circular economy. We are still forming our understanding and approach in this area, and therefore we are not yet providing financial estimates of capital or operational expenditures for such planned actions. We see three clusters of levers in Elisa’s climate transition planning – energy, supply chain, and circular economy. These are aligned with and contribute to objectives of related policies and guidelines of Elisa, especially in the areas of environmental, energy and procurement. Specific levers, such as energy efficiency improvements in mobile networks or energy attribute certificates, consist of various actions taken during the reporting year, in different parts and geographies of the Elisa group or its value chain or with other stakehol­ ders. The key actions, summarised in the table, are mostly efforts of continuous improvement over several years, but they are all expected to have an outcome that contribute to the achievement of Elisa’s near-term climate targets in 2030. We have for the above list so far not recognised significant harm that is caused to external stakeholders from actions based on our climate transition planning but will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. We ensure consistency between climate transition targets and GHG inventory boundaries, meaning that relevant emission sources are accounted for in our reporting. This is accomp­ lished by clearly establishing organisational boundaries for Elisa’s GHG inventory, including relevant regions, facilities, assets and activities. We apply consistent methodologies and, increasingly, automation in calculating GHG emissions on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, we ensure that the continuous development of methodology is transpa­ rently documented, and that data is retroactively corrected, Financial resources allocated to the Climate Transition Action Plan in 2024 Instruments Climate actions, with scope and time horizons CapEx [mEUR] OpEx [mEUR] Energy efficiency Improvements in mobile and fixed networks, for example through modernisation of 4G and 5G, as well as transforming fixed legacy networks with the latest technology. Improvements in premises and data centres, for example through modernisation in cooling, optimisation, cloudification, automation, as well as in continuous development and operation of properties. New innovations and development of solutions, for example by using machine learning and AI, distributed energy storage, smart meters, as well as implementing and developing green coding. The key actions above, are development efforts that span over several years, mainly in Elisa’s telecom network operations on the home markets of Finland and Estonia. Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions of these actions often show already within the reporting year, but usually have a long-term impact. 136 1 Other climate actions Energy generation in own direct operations, energy attribute certificates and agreements, supplier engagement for material efficiency, as well as research and beyond value chain mitigation. The key actions above, are development efforts that span over several years, and cover operations in different parts and geographies of the Elisa group or its value chain. Scope 3 emission reductions of these actions increasingly show towards Elisa’s near-term climate targets in 2030, while Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions are usually immediate. 0 3 if necessary. We have built a robust ESG data management system for the management and reporting of GHG emissions, and we have developed capabilities for scenario analyses of various emission reduction lever impacts. It is important to engage with suppliers, in particular, to drive a level of transparency that is necessary for an increasingly granular analysis of Elisa’s GHG inventory. Elisa’s first near-term target was approved by the SBTi in 2018 and was updated in 2023, including setting a new base year of 2021. Past progress made in meeting climate targets before this is available from Elisa’s annual reports. The baseline values set are based on Elisa’s assured and publicly available ESG reporting. Elisa’s international expansion poses some degree of challenge regarding this baseline, as new company acquisitions increase the boundaries of our GHG inventory to some degree. Baseline values are adjusted at the latest in updated target-setting every five years, according to SBTi guidelines. The related calculation methodology ensures that such targets remain compatible with global warming of 1.5°C. Through our double-materiality assessment (DMA), we, for example, identify parameters in Elisa’s contextual environment that can highly affect operations. We conduct structured analyses of, for example, technology-related roadmaps, Elisa’s competitors, and various other market factors, provided by our market intelligence experts. We continuously engage with stakeholders that are either impacted by our operations or have an impact on business strategy or operations, such as customers, employees, investors, regulators and suppliers. We also acknowledge the important perspectives of, for instance brought up by local communities and NGOs. Our scenario analysis accounts for both physical and transitional risks, based on various information sources. In addition to climate scenarios for geographical areas of our 68 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"operations, we analyse climate extremes and future changes in climate over the next three decades. We have utilised information sources and tools that consider climate chan­ ge-related factors that are the most relevant for our operations including flooding, severe storms and wildfire hazards. We also cover the susceptibility of society to climate change. According to this analysis, both Finland and Estonia have relatively low climate change exposures and vulnerabilities, but some of our international offices have higher risks in some areas. GHG removal and mitigation projects Elisa’s long-term goals (Net-zero 2040) allow us, in accordance with the recommendation of the SBTi initiative, to use only removal-type carbon credit projects for neutralisation of carbon emissions. This means that, at most, 10 percent of emissions at that point can be covered by carbon removal through carbon credits. We prioritise abatement within our value chain, and we are continuously investigating ways to reduce carbon emissions together with various stakeholders. We are currently focused on our near-term, science-based target for 2030, with a 42 percent reduction in all scopes of emissions. We will not use carbon credits for near-term target. Elisa is nevertheless already investing in additional mitigation actions beyond the near- and long-term science-based targets. Currently, Elisa has not developed any projects in its own operations or value chain for GHG emission removal or storage, but as part of Elisa’s CTP, we are exploring oppor­ tunities in this area. However, Elisa adopted the practice of beyond-value-chain mitigation already in 2020, with the scope of annually acquiring carbon credits in an amount equal to the remaining emissions in our own operations, meaning from fuels (Scope 1) and a small portion of other energy usage (Scope 2), as well as from waste and from business travel and employee commuting, including remote working (Scope 3). Beyond-value-chain mitigation thus comprises a valuable aspect in building the sustainable service offering that Elisa provides to its customers. Our selected carbon credit projects also have co-benefits for people and nature. Over time, Elisa has built a carbon credit portfolio with a variety of high-quality projects of different types and on different continents, according to the following motivations: • Mitigate risks with a well-balanced portfolio • Predictability for high-quality carbon credits • Benefit financially from strategic procurement • Adress Elisa’s geographical value chain impacts • Test and learn about available opportunities to support our transition When reviewing, deciding, and procuring carbon credits, we do due diligence as follows: • Additionality: The project reduces carbon emissions that are not reduced through other initiatives. • Leakage prevention: Emission reductions from the project do not leak to other locations or activities. • Permanence: The project permanently prevents the carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. • Verifiability: An objective third party confirms that emission reductions from the project are credible. • Other risk assessment: The project e.g. avoids very high-risk countries. Elisa purchased carbon credits from projects that are of high quality, verified by standard bodies like Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The methodologies of these standards ensure accurate quantification and verification for various mitigation technologies and processes. To further lessen risks in the quality of carbon credits, we do additional vetting to the extent possible together with selected partners. We follow developments in methodologies and actively engage in dialogue with providers and other experts or stakeholders, to continuously develop Elisa’s carbon credit portfolio. 69 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

Elisa reports both location-based and market-based figures. Location-based emissions for electricity consumption are calculated by using the three-year average for the total supplier mix from the latest European Residual Mix reports. For companies outside the EU, country-specific data is used, when available. In cases where country-specific data is not available, global averages are used. Market-based electricity calculations are performed using the three-year average for the residual mix from the latest European Residual Mix reports. For companies outside the EU, country-specific data is used, when available. If country-specific data is not available, global averages are used. When available, country-specific factors are used for heating and cooling. When not available, heating and cooling heating factors from the latest UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) report is used. Elisa’s core market retail sale of information and communica­ tion equipment is categorised as high climate impact sector G47.4. We do not separate this activity in Elisa’s financial statements. The total energy consumption of Elisa companies relative to revenue (energy intensity) is derived from Elisa’s total energy consumption reported in table ‘Total energy consumption in 2024’ divided by the total revenue of the Elisa group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Elisa reports all the material categories of Scope 3 emission as listed in table Gross GHG emission under significant Scope 3 emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The materiality of the specific categories and companies are based on euro-based threshold. Where the data exceeds the threshold, it is reported under relevant categories. The data used in Scope 3 are obtained either directly from Elisa’s internal systems or from third-party partner reports. Where it is possible to obtain product- and supplier-specific CO2 coefficients, they are used. For example, emissions from electronic products are calculated using supplier- and product-specific factors (e.g.: Apple products, laptops, etc.), and upstream transportation is calculated using supplier-spe­ cific emission factors. When not available, we use the general average or industry-specific factors (e.g: Defra’s emission factors, emission factors from the LIPASTO transport emission database or the average of different life cycle assessment research). 0.12 percent of emissions are calculated based on primary emission data provided directly by the suppliers. Six GHG emission categories are excluded from the calculation – upstream leased assets, downstream transportation, processing of sold products, downstream leased assets, franchising and investments – as they were assessed to be non-material. Elisa does not have significant leased assets under Scope 3 that are not already included in Scopes 1 and 2. Energy consumption at rented sites as well as energy consumption of other operators with leases is calculated and reported in Scope 2. Elisa does not engage in franchising, and emissions from investment and processing of sold products are not relevant. Emissions from downstream transportation are included in the upstream transportation categories. Due to Elisa’s growing international footprint, the boundaries of our reporting and data include new acquisitions made in 2024. Elisa continuously develops its measurements, which may imply changes in the data beyond business or operational changes. In 2024, we thoroughly developed our data collection and management processes and prioritised primary data over secondary estimated or assumed data, resulting in an overall enhancement in data quality. These improvements are noticeable, for example, indirect energy and scope 3 purchased services. Further, we have kept GHG emission factors in Scopes 1 and 2 up to date according to sources provided by third parties. Additionally, we have also updated our GHG emission factors based on the latest available knowledge for Scope 3 emissions. Elisa’s emission impact relative to revenue (emission intensity) is derived from the total emissions of Elisa companies reported in table ‘Total GHG emissions’ divided by the total revenue of the group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Accounting principles – Greenhouse gas emissions Elisa’s energy consumption and GHG emissions include data from all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. GHG emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Elisa takes general principles of calculations into account in its calculations. The boundaries of the calculation are defined so that they best correspond to Elisa’s operations. Reporting covers direct GHG emissions (Scope 1), indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) and upstream and downstream value chain emissions from relevant categories in Scope 3. Direct energy includes fuels, oils and gas purchased by Elisa for its use in mobile (such as company cars) or stationary sources (such as heating systems or generators). Scope 1 emission calculations are based on Elisa’s direct energy consumption and relevant emission factors for each fuel type. The emission factors are derived from the latest Statistics Finland database. Indirect energy includes the consumption of procured heating, cooling and electricity in various facilities (such as office premises, shops, networks, etc.) that Elisa leases or owns. In general, consumption figures are obtained from the lessor (building management company), rental bills or relevant invoices. When the actual consumption is not available, the energy is calculated based on square meters and using facility-specific consumption intensity (kWh/m2). 74 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Scope Performance Key Actions Zero waste in capital goods deliveries (upstream) by 2030 Elisa group The Zero Waste 2030 target was defined, and the Environmental Policy of Elisa was updated accordingly in 2024, providing a foundation for coming work.

"Elisa is one of Finland’s largest mobile device retailers, which is why the resources used for manufacturing of devices is material for us. In our role as a service provider, we can have a positive impact on electronic waste and the environment by offering solutions that extend the lifespan and data-secure recycling of devices. The company follows statutory regulations and instructions, also when building its networks. In building and maintaining our network, we have a process for reusing equipment; if doing so is not practically feasible for technical reasons nor financially viable due to, for example, poor energy efficiency, the material of hardware is recycled. In our office premises, recycling and waste management is organised by local partner. Waste-related data is collected through Elisa’s sustainability reporting and monitoring system and is based on data from partners or their own estimates. Performance against the target is monitored in CRMB as well as in relevant Elisa operations. Elisa is committed to supporting solutions designed for circularity through eco-design and extending product lifetimes. This includes reusing, repairing and refurbishing products to enhance their durability, reparability and recyclability, all of which are key components of the transition towards a more circular economy. We are reducing our reliance on new raw material inputs, and our aim is to prioritise sourcing circular alternatives and increasing materials recovery within our own operations. Our commitment extends to seeking the sustainable sourcing of materials, prioritising circular alternatives in our supply chain and safeguarding the health and safety of the workforce. These efforts are in line with the cascading principle of renewable resource use, which emphasises responsible and efficient utilisation of resources. Elisa engages consumers in circular thinking, for example by increasing awareness and promoting device recycling through incentives for customers. We also continue to expand our sustainable and circular offerings, for example through device-as-a-service business models. Resource inflows Manufactured electronic devices, network technologies and batteries make up the majority of inflowing materials. We utilise these technologies to operate our networks and to provide services and products to our customers and end users. These devices and technologies utilise metals and minerals, including some critical and rare materials. Many of these materials have few or no available substitutes and cannot be replaced. Additionally, the inflow also includes batteries, which can include some precious metals.

The total weight of products includes all of the manufactured materials, electronic devices and network technologies procured during 2024. The weight data is collected from Elisa’s procurement system, where the supplier provided data is used when available. In case such data is not available, we have used researched estimations. The biological material used or acquired is insignificant, thus we estimate it to be close to zero. Weight and share of secondary reused or recycled materials are estimated to be negligible and thus zero, as we do not have adequate and accurate data to do any justified calculations.

"Resource outflows – Waste Elisa does not manufacture or produce any of the products it offers in the market. Elisa operates as a retailer, supplying products to customers. In this capacity, the resource inflows and outflows – including the products and their packaging volumes – are nearly equivalent. Concerning our network operations, facilities, office premises and businesses, our resource outflows result mainly from electronic waste, which typically includes network equipment, other electronics and batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) and in addition packaging. The amount of office waste is minimal in Elisa’s waste volume, and we adhere to the waste management principles of reducing, reusing and recycling, in collaboration with local waste management partners. Elisa operates under the Extended Producer Responsibility principles by recycling electronic devices, batteries and accu­ mulators, as well as packaging material. Replaced network equipment is either reused in our own operations, sold to the second-hand market or recycled through our third-party partner. The pieces of equipment that are handed over to a third-party partner for further refurbishment and sales are first collected and examined by Elisa to assess whether they are commercially viable, before being packaged for transporta­ tion. Our shops in Finland and Estonia have WEEE collection receptacles for consumer electronic consumables, through which e.g. devices are taken for re-processing to become materials for new electronic products. Our shops in Finland have specific collection boxes for recycling mobile devices and other portable devices. We offer monetary compensation for phones eligible for reuse, for example, when purchasing a new device. Collected devices are repaired, refurbished and reintroduced to the market for consumers, contributing to the circular economy. Additionally, Elisa also complies with local laws as part of producer responsibility, for example in Finland regarding the recycling of packing waste Total waste generated in 2024 Total amount of waste (kg) 838,763 Non-recycled waste (kg) 219,803 Non-recycled waste (%) 26 Total amount of hazardous waste (kg) 356,435 Total waste diverted from disposal (kg) 675,699 Hazardous waste (kg) 356,415 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 356,415 Other recovery operations (kg) N/A Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 319,284 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 262,545 Other recovery operations (kg) 56,739 Total waste directed to disposal (kg) 163,065 Hazardous waste (kg) 20 Incineration (kg) N/A Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) 20 Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 163,045 Incineration (kg) 163,045 Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) N/A Accounting principles – Resource outflows – Waste The data includes all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. Elisa’s waste volumes consist of materials generated directly across various facilities (such as offices, shops and network infrastructure sites) and are predominantly linked to our business operations. Most of the waste is comprised of battery waste and WEEE (encompassing technology equipment and consumer electronic products), as well as metal and packaging waste. In addition, office waste forms a minor portion of our total waste volume and typically includes materials such as paper, cardboard and biowaste. The composition of these waste streams includes several types of materials, notably minerals, metals and critical materials from technology equipment and batteries, plastics from packaging materials and biomass from office biowaste. Waste data is systematically gathered through reports from our waste management partners or building management, ensuring accuracy. In cases where actual data is unavailable, particularly in certain office locations, estimates based on office headcount are used, as this directly correlates with waste generation. However, the estimated data amounts to less than 3 percent of Elisa’s total waste volume. 77 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

Elisa reports both location-based and market-based figures. Location-based emissions for electricity consumption are calculated by using the three-year average for the total supplier mix from the latest European Residual Mix reports. For companies outside the EU, country-specific data is used, when available. In cases where country-specific data is not available, global averages are used. Market-based electricity calculations are performed using the three-year average for the residual mix from the latest European Residual Mix reports. For companies outside the EU, country-specific data is used, when available. If country-specific data is not available, global averages are used. When available, country-specific factors are used for heating and cooling. When not available, heating and cooling heating factors from the latest UK Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) report is used. Elisa’s core market retail sale of information and communica­ tion equipment is categorised as high climate impact sector G47.4. We do not separate this activity in Elisa’s financial statements. The total energy consumption of Elisa companies relative to revenue (energy intensity) is derived from Elisa’s total energy consumption reported in table ‘Total energy consumption in 2024’ divided by the total revenue of the Elisa group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Elisa reports all the material categories of Scope 3 emission as listed in table Gross GHG emission under significant Scope 3 emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The materiality of the specific categories and companies are based on euro-based threshold. Where the data exceeds the threshold, it is reported under relevant categories. The data used in Scope 3 are obtained either directly from Elisa’s internal systems or from third-party partner reports. Where it is possible to obtain product- and supplier-specific CO2 coefficients, they are used. For example, emissions from electronic products are calculated using supplier- and product-specific factors (e.g.: Apple products, laptops, etc.), and upstream transportation is calculated using supplier-spe­ cific emission factors. When not available, we use the general average or industry-specific factors (e.g: Defra’s emission factors, emission factors from the LIPASTO transport emission database or the average of different life cycle assessment research). 0.12 percent of emissions are calculated based on primary emission data provided directly by the suppliers. Six GHG emission categories are excluded from the calculation – upstream leased assets, downstream transportation, processing of sold products, downstream leased assets, franchising and investments – as they were assessed to be non-material. Elisa does not have significant leased assets under Scope 3 that are not already included in Scopes 1 and 2. Energy consumption at rented sites as well as energy consumption of other operators with leases is calculated and reported in Scope 2. Elisa does not engage in franchising, and emissions from investment and processing of sold products are not relevant. Emissions from downstream transportation are included in the upstream transportation categories. Due to Elisa’s growing international footprint, the boundaries of our reporting and data include new acquisitions made in 2024. Elisa continuously develops its measurements, which may imply changes in the data beyond business or operational changes. In 2024, we thoroughly developed our data collection and management processes and prioritised primary data over secondary estimated or assumed data, resulting in an overall enhancement in data quality. These improvements are noticeable, for example, indirect energy and scope 3 purchased services. Further, we have kept GHG emission factors in Scopes 1 and 2 up to date according to sources provided by third parties. Additionally, we have also updated our GHG emission factors based on the latest available knowledge for Scope 3 emissions. Elisa’s emission impact relative to revenue (emission intensity) is derived from the total emissions of Elisa companies reported in table ‘Total GHG emissions’ divided by the total revenue of the group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Accounting principles – Greenhouse gas emissions Elisa’s energy consumption and GHG emissions include data from all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. GHG emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Elisa takes general principles of calculations into account in its calculations. The boundaries of the calculation are defined so that they best correspond to Elisa’s operations. Reporting covers direct GHG emissions (Scope 1), indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) and upstream and downstream value chain emissions from relevant categories in Scope 3. Direct energy includes fuels, oils and gas purchased by Elisa for its use in mobile (such as company cars) or stationary sources (such as heating systems or generators). Scope 1 emission calculations are based on Elisa’s direct energy consumption and relevant emission factors for each fuel type. The emission factors are derived from the latest Statistics Finland database. Indirect energy includes the consumption of procured heating, cooling and electricity in various facilities (such as office premises, shops, networks, etc.) that Elisa leases or owns. In general, consumption figures are obtained from the lessor (building management company), rental bills or relevant invoices. When the actual consumption is not available, the energy is calculated based on square meters and using facility-specific consumption intensity (kWh/m2). 74 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Scope Performance Key Actions Zero waste in capital goods deliveries (upstream) by 2030 Elisa group The Zero Waste 2030 target was defined, and the Environmental Policy of Elisa was updated accordingly in 2024, providing a foundation for coming work.

"Elisa is one of Finland’s largest mobile device retailers, which is why the resources used for manufacturing of devices is material for us. In our role as a service provider, we can have a positive impact on electronic waste and the environment by offering solutions that extend the lifespan and data-secure recycling of devices. The company follows statutory regulations and instructions, also when building its networks. In building and maintaining our network, we have a process for reusing equipment; if doing so is not practically feasible for technical reasons nor financially viable due to, for example, poor energy efficiency, the material of hardware is recycled. In our office premises, recycling and waste management is organised by local partner. Waste-related data is collected through Elisa’s sustainability reporting and monitoring system and is based on data from partners or their own estimates. Performance against the target is monitored in CRMB as well as in relevant Elisa operations. Elisa is committed to supporting solutions designed for circularity through eco-design and extending product lifetimes. This includes reusing, repairing and refurbishing products to enhance their durability, reparability and recyclability, all of which are key components of the transition towards a more circular economy. We are reducing our reliance on new raw material inputs, and our aim is to prioritise sourcing circular alternatives and increasing materials recovery within our own operations.

Elisa’s core market retail sale of information and communica­ tion equipment is categorised as high climate impact sector G47.4. We do not separate this activity in Elisa’s financial statements. The total energy consumption of Elisa companies relative to revenue (energy intensity) is derived from Elisa’s total energy consumption reported in table ‘Total energy consumption in 2024’ divided by the total revenue of the Elisa group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Elisa reports all the material categories of Scope 3 emission as listed in table Gross GHG emission under significant Scope 3 emissions in tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The materiality of the specific categories and companies are based on euro-based threshold. Where the data exceeds the threshold, it is reported under relevant categories. The data used in Scope 3 are obtained either directly from Elisa’s internal systems or from third-party partner reports. Where it is possible to obtain product- and supplier-specific CO2 coefficients, they are used. For example, emissions from electronic products are calculated using supplier- and product-specific factors (e.g.: Apple products, laptops, etc.), and upstream transportation is calculated using supplier-spe­ cific emission factors. When not available, we use the general average or industry-specific factors (e.g: Defra’s emission factors, emission factors from the LIPASTO transport emission database or the average of different life cycle assessment research). 0.12 percent of emissions are calculated based on primary emission data provided directly by the suppliers. Six GHG emission categories are excluded from the calculation – upstream leased assets, downstream transportation, processing of sold products, downstream leased assets, franchising and investments – as they were assessed to be non-material. Elisa does not have significant leased assets under Scope 3 that are not already included in Scopes 1 and 2. Energy consumption at rented sites as well as energy consumption of other operators with leases is calculated and reported in Scope 2. Elisa does not engage in franchising, and emissions from investment and processing of sold products are not relevant. Emissions from downstream transportation are included in the upstream transportation categories. Due to Elisa’s growing international footprint, the boundaries of our reporting and data include new acquisitions made in 2024. Elisa continuously develops its measurements, which may imply changes in the data beyond business or operational changes. In 2024, we thoroughly developed our data collection and management processes and prioritised primary data over secondary estimated or assumed data, resulting in an overall enhancement in data quality. These improvements are noticeable, for example, indirect energy and scope 3 purchased services. Further, we have kept GHG emission factors in Scopes 1 and 2 up to date according to sources provided by third parties. Additionally, we have also updated our GHG emission factors based on the latest available knowledge for Scope 3 emissions. Elisa’s emission impact relative to revenue (emission intensity) is derived from the total emissions of Elisa companies reported in table ‘Total GHG emissions’ divided by the total revenue of the group’s income statement (Note 2.3 of consolidated financial statements). Accounting principles – Greenhouse gas emissions Elisa’s energy consumption and GHG emissions include data from all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. GHG emissions are calculated in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. Elisa takes general principles of calculations into account in its calculations. The boundaries of the calculation are defined so that they best correspond to Elisa’s operations. Reporting covers direct GHG emissions (Scope 1), indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) and upstream and downstream value chain emissions from relevant categories in Scope 3. Direct energy includes fuels, oils and gas purchased by Elisa for its use in mobile (such as company cars) or stationary sources (such as heating systems or generators). Scope 1 emission calculations are based on Elisa’s direct energy consumption and relevant emission factors for each fuel type. The emission factors are derived from the latest Statistics Finland database. Indirect energy includes the consumption of procured heating, cooling and electricity in various facilities (such as office premises, shops, networks, etc.) that Elisa leases or owns. In general, consumption figures are obtained from the lessor (building management company), rental bills or relevant invoices. When the actual consumption is not available, the energy is calculated based on square meters and using facility-specific consumption intensity (kWh/m2). 74 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Scope Performance Key Actions Zero waste in capital goods deliveries (upstream) by 2030 Elisa group The Zero Waste 2030 target was defined, and the Environmental Policy of Elisa was updated accordingly in 2024, providing a foundation for coming work.

"Elisa is one of Finland’s largest mobile device retailers, which is why the resources used for manufacturing of devices is material for us. In our role as a service provider, we can have a positive impact on electronic waste and the environment by offering solutions that extend the lifespan and data-secure recycling of devices. The company follows statutory regulations and instructions, also when building its networks. In building and maintaining our network, we have a process for reusing equipment; if doing so is not practically feasible for technical reasons nor financially viable due to, for example, poor energy efficiency, the material of hardware is recycled. In our office premises, recycling and waste management is organised by local partner. Waste-related data is collected through Elisa’s sustainability reporting and monitoring system and is based on data from partners or their own estimates. Performance against the target is monitored in CRMB as well as in relevant Elisa operations. Elisa is committed to supporting solutions designed for circularity through eco-design and extending product lifetimes. This includes reusing, repairing and refurbishing products to enhance their durability, reparability and recyclability, all of which are key components of the transition towards a more circular economy. We are reducing our reliance on new raw material inputs, and our aim is to prioritise sourcing circular alternatives and increasing materials recovery within our own operations. Our commitment extends to seeking the sustainable sourcing of materials, prioritising circular alternatives in our supply chain and safeguarding the health and safety of the workforce. These efforts are in line with the cascading principle of renewable resource use, which emphasises responsible and efficient utilisation of resources. Elisa engages consumers in circular thinking, for example by increasing awareness and promoting device recycling through incentives for customers. We also continue to expand our sustainable and circular offerings, for example through device-as-a-service business models. Resource inflows Manufactured electronic devices, network technologies and batteries make up the majority of inflowing materials. We utilise these technologies to operate our networks and to provide services and products to our customers and end users. These devices and technologies utilise metals and minerals, including some critical and rare materials. Many of these materials have few or no available substitutes and cannot be replaced. Additionally, the inflow also includes batteries, which can include some precious metals. Resource inflows in 2024 Total weight of resource inflow products including packaging (kg) 79,199,692 Percentage of biological materials including packaging (%) 0.4 The absolute weight of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials including packaging (kg) 0 Percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials (%) 0 Accounting principles – Resource inflows The data includes Elisa Corporation (Finland) and Elisa Eesti As as the resource inflow is most relevant to these businesses. The total weight of products includes all of the manufactured materials, electronic devices and network technologies procured during 2024. The weight data is collected from Elisa’s procurement system, where the supplier provided data is used when available. In case such data is not available, we have used researched estimations. The biological material used or acquired is insignificant, thus we estimate it to be close to zero. Weight and share of secondary reused or recycled materials are estimated to be negligible and thus zero, as we do not have adequate and accurate data to do any justified calculations. To ensure accuracy, we have diligently avoided double counting by using the data from Elisa’s procurement system only once and have used third party assurance of data and calculations. 76 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Resource outflows – Waste Elisa does not manufacture or produce any of the products it offers in the market. Elisa operates as a retailer, supplying products to customers. In this capacity, the resource inflows and outflows – including the products and their packaging volumes – are nearly equivalent. Concerning our network operations, facilities, office premises and businesses, our resource outflows result mainly from electronic waste, which typically includes network equipment, other electronics and batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) and in addition packaging. The amount of office waste is minimal in Elisa’s waste volume, and we adhere to the waste management principles of reducing, reusing and recycling, in collaboration with local waste management partners. Elisa operates under the Extended Producer Responsibility principles by recycling electronic devices, batteries and accu­ mulators, as well as packaging material. Replaced network equipment is either reused in our own operations, sold to the second-hand market or recycled through our third-party partner. The pieces of equipment that are handed over to a third-party partner for further refurbishment and sales are first collected and examined by Elisa to assess whether they are commercially viable, before being packaged for transporta­ tion. Our shops in Finland and Estonia have WEEE collection receptacles for consumer electronic consumables, through which e.g. devices are taken for re-processing to become materials for new electronic products. Our shops in Finland have specific collection boxes for recycling mobile devices and other portable devices. We offer monetary compensation for phones eligible for reuse, for example, when purchasing a new device. Collected devices are repaired, refurbished and reintroduced to the market for consumers, contributing to the circular economy. Additionally, Elisa also complies with local laws as part of producer responsibility, for example in Finland regarding the recycling of packing waste Total waste generated in 2024 Total amount of waste (kg) 838,763 Non-recycled waste (kg) 219,803 Non-recycled waste (%) 26 Total amount of hazardous waste (kg) 356,435 Total waste diverted from disposal (kg) 675,699 Hazardous waste (kg) 356,415 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 356,415 Other recovery operations (kg) N/A Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 319,284 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 262,545 Other recovery operations (kg) 56,739 Total waste directed to disposal (kg) 163,065 Hazardous waste (kg) 20 Incineration (kg) N/A Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) 20 Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 163,045 Incineration (kg) 163,045 Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) N/A Accounting principles – Resource outflows – Waste The data includes all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. Elisa’s waste volumes consist of materials generated directly across various facilities (such as offices, shops and network infrastructure sites) and are predominantly linked to our business operations. Most of the waste is comprised of battery waste and WEEE (encompassing technology equipment and consumer electronic products), as well as metal and packaging waste. In addition, office waste forms a minor portion of our total waste volume and typically includes materials such as paper, cardboard and biowaste. The composition of these waste streams includes several types of materials, notably minerals, metals and critical materials from technology equipment and batteries, plastics from packaging materials and biomass from office biowaste. Waste data is systematically gathered through reports from our waste management partners or building management, ensuring accuracy. In cases where actual data is unavailable, particularly in certain office locations, estimates based on office headcount are used, as this directly correlates with waste generation. However, the estimated data amounts to less than 3 percent of Elisa’s total waste volume. 77 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

The Code of Conduct establishes the framework for our business operations and sets out the ethical standards for Elisa group employees, businesses and partners. More information on the Code of Conduct is described in the section Business Conduct. Elisa’s Human Rights Policy – which was updated in 2024 – sets the foundations for and guides our development of our human rights due diligence process across all our operations and chains of activities as well as the framework for Elisa’s human rights commitment. It was updated according to Elisa’s human rights impact assessment results. Impact assessment was conducted in alignment with the UNGPs, and it takes in consideration internationalisation of Elisa operations and the evolution of human rights due diligence process. The policy applies to Elisa, the entities that it owns or in which it holds a majority interest, and the operations that it manages. Elisa expects its workers, business partners and other parties whose own impacts may be directly linked to Elisa’s operations, products or services to respect and not infringe upon human rights. The Elisa policy on human rights highlights our dedication to ensure a workplace free from harassment, bullying and discrimination, and to treat everyone equally in recruitment, career and learning opportunities, compensation, and in termination of work relation. Elisa does not tolerate any form of human trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour or slavery, or any form of modern slavery, within Elisa or in its chain of activities. In cases where the company identifies potential adverse human rights impacts, it is committed to promptly and effectively providing and enabling remedies. Elisa’s grievance and remediation approach includes addressing any adverse human rights impacts that the company has caused or contributed to that affect individuals, workers or communities. Health and safety Elisa’s occupational health and safety practices are lead through good management and action programmes that are part of our daily work. The development of the working environment is the right and duty of every employee. Employees can participate in and influence the handling of occupational health and safety (OHS) issues in the workplace. Elisa complies the occupational health and safety legislation of each country where it operates. S – Social Occupational healthcare operates in accordance with good occupational healthcare practice. It aims to ensure a healthy and safe working environment and a well-functioning work community, to prevent of work-related illnesses, and to maintain and promote the working ability and functional capacity of Elisa employees. An annual action plan covering all units and localities and has the key objectives of occu­ pational health care. The functionality and effectiveness of occupational healthcare are monitored via e.g. reports on sickness-related absences and occupational healthcare costs, as well as user feedback. Elisa’s human resource functions are responsible for the procurement and development of occupational health care. In addition to that, Elisa has established a working environment committee that addresses OHS issues at the Elisa Corporation level in Finland and coordinates the activities of the OHS organisation and programs. The working environment committee monitors the implementation of occupational health care services and makes development suggestions. Additio­ nally, the committee is responsible for drawing up the OHS action program, determining measures for monitoring the healthiness and safety of workplaces and monitoring accidents and sickness-related absences at the company level. Working environment teams monitor sickness-related absences on a location/region/activity-specific basis. Elisa collects, records, and measures the number of work-related injuries of its subcontractors both in Finland and Estonia. Also, we follow local laws and guidance and cooperate closely with the subcontractors to ensure the safety of performing the job. 95 percent of Elisa’s employees are covered with OHS, and no fatalities have occurred in the last three years. Information about healthcare services is available on Elisa’s intranet pages, and it is also included in employees’ induction. Diversity, equity and inclusion As an employer, Elisa follows principles of non-discrimination and equality in all our operations, and we also require compliance with these principles from all of our partners. We promote equality throughout the entire life cycle of employment. Diverse workforce enriches our perspectives, promotes innovation and supports learning together. At Elisa, equality and equity are steered by several guidelines and principles, the most important of which are Elisa’s values and the Elisa Code of Conduct. Every employee conducts mandatory training in the Elisa Code of Conduct, which introduces Elisa’s non-discrimination principles. The occupational health and safety, human rights and remote working policies strengthen equality and equity, and they are also promoted through our daily management practices. Responsibility for implementing these practices and ensuring adequate resource allocation is assigned to Elisa’s Executive Vice President of human resource function, who oversees the integration of these values into our operations. Elisa develops workplaces and working practices to provide adequate and safe working conditions for all, making reasonable accommodations where necessary. The company also welcomes equal access to family leave. To facilitate employees’, return to work after family leave or other longer absences, we usually agree with employees about sharing information on current issues. Adequate reorientation training is provided for those returning from family leave. 78 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Environment Governance Assurance Annexes Social"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Scope Performance Key Actions Zero waste in capital goods deliveries (upstream) by 2030 Elisa group The Zero Waste 2030 target was defined, and the Environmental Policy of Elisa was updated accordingly in 2024, providing a foundation for coming work.

"Elisa is one of Finland’s largest mobile device retailers, which is why the resources used for manufacturing of devices is material for us. In our role as a service provider, we can have a positive impact on electronic waste and the environment by offering solutions that extend the lifespan and data-secure recycling of devices. The company follows statutory regulations and instructions, also when building its networks. In building and maintaining our network, we have a process for reusing equipment; if doing so is not practically feasible for technical reasons nor financially viable due to, for example, poor energy efficiency, the material of hardware is recycled. In our office premises, recycling and waste management is organised by local partner. Waste-related data is collected through Elisa’s sustainability reporting and monitoring system and is based on data from partners or their own estimates. Performance against the target is monitored in CRMB as well as in relevant Elisa operations. Elisa is committed to supporting solutions designed for circularity through eco-design and extending product lifetimes. This includes reusing, repairing and refurbishing products to enhance their durability, reparability and recyclability, all of which are key components of the transition towards a more circular economy. We are reducing our reliance on new raw material inputs, and our aim is to prioritise sourcing circular alternatives and increasing materials recovery within our own operations. Our commitment extends to seeking the sustainable sourcing of materials, prioritising circular alternatives in our supply chain and safeguarding the health and safety of the workforce. These efforts are in line with the cascading principle of renewable resource use, which emphasises responsible and efficient utilisation of resources. Elisa engages consumers in circular thinking, for example by increasing awareness and promoting device recycling through incentives for customers. We also continue to expand our sustainable and circular offerings, for example through device-as-a-service business models. Resource inflows Manufactured electronic devices, network technologies and batteries make up the majority of inflowing materials. We utilise these technologies to operate our networks and to provide services and products to our customers and end users. These devices and technologies utilise metals and minerals, including some critical and rare materials. Many of these materials have few or no available substitutes and cannot be replaced. Additionally, the inflow also includes batteries, which can include some precious metals. Resource inflows in 2024 Total weight of resource inflow products including packaging (kg) 79,199,692 Percentage of biological materials including packaging (%) 0.4 The absolute weight of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials including packaging (kg) 0 Percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials (%) 0 Accounting principles – Resource inflows The data includes Elisa Corporation (Finland) and Elisa Eesti As as the resource inflow is most relevant to these businesses. The total weight of products includes all of the manufactured materials, electronic devices and network technologies procured during 2024. The weight data is collected from Elisa’s procurement system, where the supplier provided data is used when available. In case such data is not available, we have used researched estimations. The biological material used or acquired is insignificant, thus we estimate it to be close to zero. Weight and share of secondary reused or recycled materials are estimated to be negligible and thus zero, as we do not have adequate and accurate data to do any justified calculations. To ensure accuracy, we have diligently avoided double counting by using the data from Elisa’s procurement system only once and have used third party assurance of data and calculations. 76 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Resource outflows – Waste Elisa does not manufacture or produce any of the products it offers in the market. Elisa operates as a retailer, supplying products to customers. In this capacity, the resource inflows and outflows – including the products and their packaging volumes – are nearly equivalent. Concerning our network operations, facilities, office premises and businesses, our resource outflows result mainly from electronic waste, which typically includes network equipment, other electronics and batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) and in addition packaging. The amount of office waste is minimal in Elisa’s waste volume, and we adhere to the waste management principles of reducing, reusing and recycling, in collaboration with local waste management partners. Elisa operates under the Extended Producer Responsibility principles by recycling electronic devices, batteries and accu­ mulators, as well as packaging material. Replaced network equipment is either reused in our own operations, sold to the second-hand market or recycled through our third-party partner. The pieces of equipment that are handed over to a third-party partner for further refurbishment and sales are first collected and examined by Elisa to assess whether they are commercially viable, before being packaged for transporta­ tion. Our shops in Finland and Estonia have WEEE collection receptacles for consumer electronic consumables, through which e.g. devices are taken for re-processing to become materials for new electronic products. Our shops in Finland have specific collection boxes for recycling mobile devices and other portable devices. We offer monetary compensation for phones eligible for reuse, for example, when purchasing a new device. Collected devices are repaired, refurbished and reintroduced to the market for consumers, contributing to the circular economy. Additionally, Elisa also complies with local laws as part of producer responsibility, for example in Finland regarding the recycling of packing waste Total waste generated in 2024 Total amount of waste (kg) 838,763 Non-recycled waste (kg) 219,803 Non-recycled waste (%) 26 Total amount of hazardous waste (kg) 356,435 Total waste diverted from disposal (kg) 675,699 Hazardous waste (kg) 356,415 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 356,415 Other recovery operations (kg) N/A Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 319,284 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 262,545 Other recovery operations (kg) 56,739 Total waste directed to disposal (kg) 163,065 Hazardous waste (kg) 20 Incineration (kg) N/A Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) 20 Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 163,045 Incineration (kg) 163,045 Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) N/A Accounting principles – Resource outflows – Waste The data includes all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. Elisa’s waste volumes consist of materials generated directly across various facilities (such as offices, shops and network infrastructure sites) and are predominantly linked to our business operations. Most of the waste is comprised of battery waste and WEEE (encompassing technology equipment and consumer electronic products), as well as metal and packaging waste. In addition, office waste forms a minor portion of our total waste volume and typically includes materials such as paper, cardboard and biowaste. The composition of these waste streams includes several types of materials, notably minerals, metals and critical materials from technology equipment and batteries, plastics from packaging materials and biomass from office biowaste. Waste data is systematically gathered through reports from our waste management partners or building management, ensuring accuracy. In cases where actual data is unavailable, particularly in certain office locations, estimates based on office headcount are used, as this directly correlates with waste generation. However, the estimated data amounts to less than 3 percent of Elisa’s total waste volume. 77 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS S1 Own workers Policies Elisa acknowledges the universal and absolute nature of fundamental human rights that protect the freedom, dignity and equality of all people. Elisa is committed to respecting human rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises throughout our value chain. Elisa is committed to respecting the human rights and labour rights of everyone working for Elisa, either directly as an employee or indirectly as non-employees.

"Elisa is committed to providing a working environment that encourages everyone to learn, grow, share ideas and develop their work. It is important that everyone can be themselves and feel heard as they are. Discrimination, bullying and harassment, including racism and sexual harassment, are not tolerated at Elisa. Elisa strives to treat everybody equally, regardless of any need a person has for special support, their ethnic origin, age, sexual orientation, gender or religious beliefs, or other personally distinguishing characteristics. It is important to recognise that implementing equality and equal treatment requires us to make evaluations based on dimensions other than, for example, just gender. Communicating and enabling dialogue about equality and equity is an important part of promoting them. We share information and facilitate internal dialogue with employees through for example internal newsletters and separate, targeted events about equality. Elisa monitors the effectiveness of its internal communication measures through our employee engagement survey. The means for equity communication are reviewed in Equality and Equity Working Group and Sustainability Communication Group. Each Elisa company has appropriate, compliant and updated equality and equity plans, guidelines and policies available on their intranets. Elisa Corporation (Finland) is a member of the Finnish Business & Society (FIBS) diversity network and the Inklusiiv community in Finland. Elisa Eesti As is also a member of Estonian Human Rights Center diversity network and have signed Estonian Diversity Charter. Training and career development Elisa sees continuous learning as one of the major enablers for its business success. The Enabling Learning process describes how we at Elisa enable daily learning for every employee. It covers our roles and main practices for learning. One of Elisa’s values is we grow and develop fearlessly, which guides elisians to be enthusiastic about learning and continuous improvement. At Elisa, we approach competence development through the 70-20-10 learning model (70 percent learning from the work, 20 percent learning from others, 10 percent formal training), and we systematically develop competencies. Employees agree about how to develop their competences with their line manager in their Learning and Objective Discussions, which ensures that the direction of competence development is aligned with our strategy. Overall, the purpose of the 70-20-10 model is to expand our thinking regarding methods of competence development, as well as to help us recognise the best ways to do our daily work. Elisa wants to foster continuous learning for all. The company takes advantage of various Elisa-supported learning methods (such as job rotation and working experiments), which also make our operations more flexible. The company wants to involve employees when developing their work and teamwork. Elisa constantly develops working community based on, for example, the results of regular employee surveys. Working conditions Elisa complies with applicable legislation and laws regarding working conditions and labour laws in all the countries of operation in addition to relevant Elisa-level practices. Our Human Rights Policy reaffirms our commitment to fair terms and conditions of employment. In Finland, Elisa follows industry-specific collective bargaining agreements. More than 95 percent of Elisa employees are located in Europe (e.g. in Finland, Estonia, Italy, Sweden, Germany), which has strict statutory requirements concerning working conditions in areas such as reasonable working hours, annual leave, parental leave and part-time work. Where national law allows, all employees are free to choose whether they want to be part of a trade union. Where the nature of the work permits, employees can have flexible working hours and flexibility in choosing when they work remotely. Elisa has an established European Works Council (EWC). The goal of the EWC is to improve employees’ access to information, which means the exchange of views and dialogue between management and employees. The dialogue takes place directly and openly. Strong interaction is an essential part of information and consultation, intended to clarify and communicate the needs both of Elisa and its employees. Our approach Elisa is an important employer in our domestic markets, Finland and Estonia, where more than 80 percent of our workforce are located. However, as an increasingly international company, we also employ a growing number of professionals in various locations globally to work in our digital service businesses. In addition to our employees, we employ more than 6,000 indirect workers (non-employees) through external employment agencies. Elisa revisits impacts on workforce through regular assessments, employee feedback and engagement. In that process, it takes especially consideration to vulnerable or marginalised groups. These groups could include workers with different disabilities, age, gender, sexual orientation or work in unique contexts and are undertaking specific activities. Elisa’s workforce consists mainly of employees in technology development, sales and customer support roles, requiring specialised knowledge and skills in the ICT sector. These positions are mainly situated in office or store environments. The work is carried out with laptops and other smart devices. The health impacts of the work are typically related to mental and physical strain. Furthermore, employees working in retail environments, such as shops and open stalls in malls, may face safety impacts due to customer behaviour. Additionally, part of non-employee worker is involved in the construction and maintenance of Elisa’s network infrastructure, requiring activities such as climbing high masts/towers, which present health and safety risks. Health and safety concerns are significant for workers engaged in network construction and maintenance due to the nature of their work. Other non-employee workers, including subcontractors, agency workers and consultants, work under Elisa’s supervision but are employed and compensated by third-party companies. Nonetheless, Elisa recognises its direct and indirect impact on these non-employee workers. All these workforces that can be materially impacted by Elisa’s operations and business activities are included in the scope of disclosure Elisa is committed to enhancing the wellbeing of its workforce through initiatives focused on mental health support and safe working conditions. The company actively pursues opportu­ nities to positively impact its employees and non-employee workers by providing continuous training, development programmes, and a supportive work environment. These initiatives benefit all workers, including those in office and customer-facing roles, by improving job satisfaction and performance. Elisa also seeks opportunities to foster a positive work culture that emphasises diversity, equity and inclusion, which can enhance employee engagement and productivity. In the autumn of 2024, Elisa decided to introduce new hybrid work principles from the beginning of the year 2025, requiring employees to work at minimum three days per week in the office location of Elisa. The new hybrid working model was introduced to proactively mitigate the potential negative impacts of too extensive remote work and to emphasise the 79 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Environment Governance Assurance Annexes Social"
