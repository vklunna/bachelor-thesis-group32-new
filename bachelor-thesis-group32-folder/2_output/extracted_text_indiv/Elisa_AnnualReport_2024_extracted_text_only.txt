"Climate change adaptation and energy-related opportunities Climate change has been part of Elisa’s strategy, since 2009. Our experience enables us to help our customers in creation of a more sustainable future through digitalisation. We see opportunities in tackling climate challenges by developing new business innovations in sustainability. For instance, our International Digital Services is built on our expertise in automation and digitalisation. Elisa offers an IoT platform with advanced machine learning and predictive analysis capabilities. This technology can be used also to better manage energy efficiency and other relevant parameters of buildings. Furthermore, Elisa’s AI-driven software helps ramp up production quickly and sustainably by identifying issues and optimising energy use. Our Distributed Energy Solution (DES) transforms radio access networks into virtual power plants, using AI to efficiently manage energy by controlling the charging and discharging of batteries. DES also has the capability of providing grid-balancing services to transmission system operators (TSOs). This helps in addressing the challenges posed by renewable energy sources. In Finland, Elisa utilises DES to participate in the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve, providing grid-balancing services to Fingrid, the national TSO. Transition plan for climate change mitigation Elisa has committed to the Paris Agreement to keep global warming to 1.5°C. In 2023, we received approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for Elisa’s updated near-term science-based target, and we are the first listed company in Finland to set a long-term net-zero target. On our ambitious journey towards Net-zero in 2040, we are currently focusing on Elisa’s 2030 near-term climate target of a 42 percent absolute reduction in GHG emissions in all our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions compared to the base year of 2021. We publicly share a high-level overview of Elisa’s climate transition planning on our website. Elisa’s climate targets are reviewed by Elisa’s BOD and approved by CEB. These targets have been communicated to internal and external stakeholders. The Elisa Climate Transition Plan (CTP) is a roadmap towards low carbon business in Elisa’s own operations as well as its chain of activities. Through CTP and more concrete Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), we drive our ambitious near-term and long- term climate targets. This takes a long-term commitment of continuous improvement in carbon emission reduction and creates the foundation for climate actions over the three-year strategy period for 2025–2027. The CTP is integrated to Elisa’s environmental management system (EMS) and energy management system (EnMS). Scope 1 and 2 emissions are responsible for about 1percent of Elisa’s total carbon emissions, resulting Scope 3 emission to be 99 percent and thus having the material impact. From Scope 3 emissions, our own operations (waste generated, business travel and employee commuting) result in only 2 percent while the remaining are from Elisa’s value chain. Therefore, supply chain engagement and collaboration are crucial to drive our climate targets and keep within planetary boundaries. In 2024, Elisa launched its responsible supplier financing, which is a working capital financing solution offered by Elisa together with its finance partner. Material efficiency is enabled mainly through circular economy solutions. To reduce the amount of waste in our operations, we repair, refurbish and reuse when feasible, and we responsibly recycle equipment at the end of its lifespan. We also offer device repair and refurbishment services to our customers, as well as specific circular economy business models, like devices-as-a-service. Energy efficiency has been part of our operational development and monitored on a strategic level since 2009. By the end of 2024, we had improved our energy efficiency in mobile data transfers by 71percent since 2016. Similarly, Elisa’s carbon footprint from Scope 1 and 2 emissions had decreased by more than 80 percent compared to 2016. In some cases, we have been able to productise innovations that we have created to address energy efficiency in our own operations, making them part of the sustainable solutions we offer to customers. Energy efficiency initiatives throughout Elisa’s operations receive substantial continuous investments i.e. through modernisation. Also, Elisa’s first circular economy initiatives, in the form of building repair and refurbishment capabilities, have received significant investments. The latter is also reported according to EU Taxonomy regulations. Elisa does not have a high-emissions infrastructure as we use only carbon-free electricity for our telecom networks and data centres. Elisa thus has very few assets with locked-in GHG emissions other than backup power generators, which use fossil fuels but are difficult to phase out due to regulatory resilience requirements. In Elisa’s annual strategy process, the results of the double materiality assessment are utilised to identify the environme­ ntal issues important to the business. The strategic sustaina­ bility targets are part of Elisa’s high-level strategic action plan (Key Means), each owned by a designated member of CEB. These members, along with the appointed strategy leads, are responsible for ensuring that the necessary actions, goals, and resources are in place to achieve the targets within the agreed timelines. This approach ensures ownership, delegation, sufficient resources for implementation, and regular monitoring of the strategic action plan’s execution that support the target. The strategy owners and leads are responsible for reporting on performance to the relevant Elisa stakeholders. In Elisa’s annual strategy process, the environ­ mental issues important to the business are reviewed. CRMB approves EMS as well as monitors and guides the CTAP. Elisa’s relevant businesses are responsible for setting adequate actions according to CTAP. EMS development and CTAP follow up is maintained by domain experts in the Elisa Environment and Energy Working Group (EEWG). The EEWG tracks progress in implementing the CTAP, as part of the regular management of both the EMS and EnMS. The CRMB reviews the performance regularly. 63 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E1 Climate change Policies Elisa has set Group-level policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Elisa Code of Conduct sets the foundation for our ethical business behaviour. Elisa’s Environmental Policy describes our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our business in our own operations and chain of activities. Similarly, Elisa’s Energy Policy describes our goal to sustainably improving energy performance. Additionally, Elisa Code of Ethical Purchasing describes the ethical and legal duties and responsibilities of our suppliers. Elisa complies with all applicable environmental and climate legislation and regulations and requires all the stakeholders in its operations and chain of activities to similarly comply with them. Elisa’s Environmental and Energy Policy adhere to the principles and reporting guidelines of the CSRD, the UN Global Compact, and the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. These policies are approved by Elisa’s Corporate Responsibility Management Board (CRMB). These policies are publicly available and accessible applying to every employee in Elisa and all third parties acting on behalf of Elisa. We require our suppliers, subcontractors, and external partners to comply with these or similar principles. The policies provide clear guidance on responsible practices and outlines commitments and strategies for achieving envi­ ronmental sustainability and addressing climate change within Elisa’s global operations. It addresses Elisa’s commitment to climate change mitigation and adaptation, energy and resource efficiency, and circularity. Through sustainable actions and the development of innovative solutions, Elisa aims to significantly reduce both its own carbon footprint and those of its customers. Our approach As a part of double materiality assessment (DMA), Elisa has evaluated impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. The material negative impacts lie both in our upstream supply chain and in our own operations. Elisa’s previous climate scenarios work was utilised as part of our DMA, and it is addressed while creating financial statements. Through this work, Elisa has identified physical and transitional climate risks, which pose impacts for Elisa’s operations over different time horizons. Climate change resilience analysis has been conducted for the whole Elisa group of companies and key supplier categories. In the analysis, we assess which of Elisa’s locations of operation have physical climate change vulnerabilities. For such identified locations, we further assess the risks and potential impacts, on which we base the development of strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Our climate change resilience analysis was revisited in 2024. When conducting our resilience analysis, we identify factors that apply to Elisa’s operations over the short, medium and long term. Based on our resilience analysis locations of operation in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe will not be signifi­ cantly affected by climate change in the short term. We have identified that Elisa has operations in areas with, for example, water scarcity vulnerabilities. Drought does not have direct impact on Elisa’s operations in short term. We use resilience analysis findings in Elisa’s Climate Transition Plan, to ensure alignment with related strategic and tactical actions across the organisation. It also has implications to financial planning. Elisa’s dependencies on the value chain, and especially the supply chain and its performance in climate transition, impacts on risks and, to some degree, on opportunities, as well as our corporate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As an organisation, we are continuing our work on mitigating global warming by reducing our carbon footprint, to ensure actions for target of a 1.5°C global average temperature rise, while simultaneously adapting operations for a scenario of up to 3°C. We already see that regulation is a key driver of ambitious environmental targets for European companies, not only for climate, but also in aligning with planetary boundaries overall. We aim for solid, longer-term strategies that integrate sustainability with Elisa’s digital business operations, enabling us to respond to emerging issues in an increasingly complex and unpredictable world. For the same reasons, we are continuing to experiment to drive rapid learning and innovation. Potential climate-related hazards in Elisa’s operations We have identified the following climate-related hazards in Elisa’s main markets in Northern Europe, over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons: Short term (0–2 years) • Extreme weather events, such as severe winter storms • Flooding of vulnerable locations during heavy rainfall • Wildfires becoming more intense and frequent Medium term (3–5 years) • Longer heatwaves and extreme temperature events • Increased precipitation and seasonally heavy rainfall Long term (over 5 years) • Droughts becoming more frequent and prolonged • Rising sea levels, leading to coastal erosion and flooding 60 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"

"operations, we analyse climate extremes and future changes in climate over the next three decades. We have utilised information sources and tools that consider climate chan­ ge-related factors that are the most relevant for our operations including flooding, severe storms and wildfire hazards. We also cover the susceptibility of society to climate change. According to this analysis, both Finland and Estonia have relatively low climate change exposures and vulnerabilities, but some of our international offices have higher risks in some areas. GHG removal and mitigation projects Elisa’s long-term goals (Net-zero 2040) allow us, in accordance with the recommendation of the SBTi initiative, to use only removal-type carbon credit projects for neutralisation of carbon emissions. This means that, at most, 10 percent of emissions at that point can be covered by carbon removal through carbon credits. We prioritise abatement within our value chain, and we are continuously investigating ways to reduce carbon emissions together with various stakeholders. We are currently focused on our near-term, science-based target for 2030, with a 42 percent reduction in all scopes of emissions. We will not use carbon credits for near-term target. Elisa is nevertheless already investing in additional mitigation actions beyond the near- and long-term science-based targets. Currently, Elisa has not developed any projects in its own operations or value chain for GHG emission removal or storage, but as part of Elisa’s CTP, we are exploring oppor­ tunities in this area. However, Elisa adopted the practice of beyond-value-chain mitigation already in 2020, with the scope of annually acquiring carbon credits in an amount equal to the remaining emissions in our own operations, meaning from fuels (Scope 1) and a small portion of other energy usage (Scope 2), as well as from waste and from business travel and employee commuting, including remote working (Scope 3). Beyond-value-chain mitigation thus comprises a valuable aspect in building the sustainable service offering that Elisa provides to its customers. Our selected carbon credit projects also have co-benefits for people and nature. Over time, Elisa has built a carbon credit portfolio with a variety of high-quality projects of different types and on different continents, according to the following motivations: • Mitigate risks with a well-balanced portfolio • Predictability for high-quality carbon credits • Benefit financially from strategic procurement • Adress Elisa’s geographical value chain impacts • Test and learn about available opportunities to support our transition When reviewing, deciding, and procuring carbon credits, we do due diligence as follows: • Additionality: The project reduces carbon emissions that are not reduced through other initiatives. • Leakage prevention: Emission reductions from the project do not leak to other locations or activities. • Permanence: The project permanently prevents the carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. • Verifiability: An objective third party confirms that emission reductions from the project are credible. • Other risk assessment: The project e.g. avoids very high-risk countries. Elisa purchased carbon credits from projects that are of high quality, verified by standard bodies like Gold Standard and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The methodologies of these standards ensure accurate quantification and verification for various mitigation technologies and processes. To further lessen risks in the quality of carbon credits, we do additional vetting to the extent possible together with selected partners. We follow developments in methodologies and actively engage in dialogue with providers and other experts or stakeholders, to continuously develop Elisa’s carbon credit portfolio. 69 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models. Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets. Targets, actions and performance in 2024 Target Scope Performance Key Actions Zero waste in capital goods deliveries (upstream) by 2030 Elisa group The Zero Waste 2030 target was defined, and the Environmental Policy of Elisa was updated accordingly in 2024, providing a foundation for coming work.

Similarly, we continuously seek ways to improve the resource efficiency of our own operations, through reuse, repair and refurbishment, as well as contributing to second-hand marketplaces. Elisa has not directly engaged with local communities regarding circularity and waste; however, we have regular dialogue and co-operation with our customers and suppliers including waste management partners. Elisa has not identified any communities directly affected or harmed by Elisa’s impacts on resource use and circular economy including waste. We assess our impact to ensure that impacts of our actions do not negatively affect our stakeholders and will evaluate remedy actions if such cases emerge. As the circular economy (including resource inflows and resource outflows-waste) is assessed to be material for Elisa, as part of our climate transition, we have set Elisa group-level Zero Waste 2030 target. Zero waste for us means the conservation of resources in all operations to avoid harmful discharges. Elisa’s Zero Waste 2030 target is voluntary and is not mandated by legislation. It addresses minimising and gradually phasing out waste to landfill. Waste is managed through targeted actions in upstream direct operations and downstream, including proper treatment through circularity processes, such as materials recovery and reuse. The target is divided into three sub-targets. The first sub-target is zero waste in capital goods deliveries, which means minimising and using recyclable packaging materials for network equipment. The second sub-target is zero waste to landfill or non-energy incineration, which means minimising waste from offices and stores as well as reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling network equipment. The third sub-target is zero waste until customer handover, which means reusing, refurbishing and responsibly recycling devices. The progress of performance is reviewed against the target set. The target is aligned with our Environmental policy where we have pledged to manage the material negative impacts and risks of our operations. We have engaged the internal stakeholder in setting the targets.

"ESRS E5 Resource use and circular economy Policies Elisa updated its group-level Environmental Policy in 2024 to advance its goals of resource efficiency, circularity and waste management. The policy focuses on key areas such as reducing waste, enhancing resource efficiency and transi­ tioning toward a circular economy. Elisa promotes reducing reliance on virgin resources and sustainable sourcing by supporting circular design solutions and prioritising circular alternatives whenever feasible. Within its operations, Elisa focuses on extending product lifespans and developing circular business models aimed at phasing out landfill use and minimising non-energy waste incineration. The company also supports its customers and stakeholders in the circular economy by providing circular offerings to customers. At Elisa, we develop our operations with the approach of prioritising prevention, reuse, refurbishing and recycling, and other recovery methods over disposal. We are committed to minimising waste generation through responsible business practices, engaging stakeholders in circularity initiatives and ensuring that the transition to a more circular economy is fair and just for all. More information on the scope and implementation of this policy is described in the section Climate change Our approach As part of double materiality assessment, Elisa has evaluated its impacts, risks and opportunities which is explained in the DMA section of this statement. Elisa does not have manufactu­ ring operations of its own, but we recognise that our business and operations are dependent on using natural resources, which are required to produce devices and equipment that we use and sell. Additionally, we see the resource outflow aspect of the circular economy largely as an opportunity, for example through our device refurbishment and repair business for consumer customers, or by providing device-as- a-service circular economy business models for our corporate customers. Elisa is dependent on upstream value chain climate commitments to reach its climate targets. Through circular economy actions in collaboration with our suppliers, we are continuously improving resource efficiency in our own activities, but also more widely in our value chain. Circularity actions are also important vehicles to positively contribute to our climate and other environmental impacts. We have established business models in our downstream value chain that enable our customers to engage with circular business models.

"Elisa is one of Finland’s largest mobile device retailers, which is why the resources used for manufacturing of devices is material for us. In our role as a service provider, we can have a positive impact on electronic waste and the environment by offering solutions that extend the lifespan and data-secure recycling of devices. The company follows statutory regulations and instructions, also when building its networks. In building and maintaining our network, we have a process for reusing equipment; if doing so is not practically feasible for technical reasons nor financially viable due to, for example, poor energy efficiency, the material of hardware is recycled. In our office premises, recycling and waste management is organised by local partner. Waste-related data is collected through Elisa’s sustainability reporting and monitoring system and is based on data from partners or their own estimates. Performance against the target is monitored in CRMB as well as in relevant Elisa operations. Elisa is committed to supporting solutions designed for circularity through eco-design and extending product lifetimes. This includes reusing, repairing and refurbishing products to enhance their durability, reparability and recyclability, all of which are key components of the transition towards a more circular economy. We are reducing our reliance on new raw material inputs, and our aim is to prioritise sourcing circular alternatives and increasing materials recovery within our own operations. Our commitment extends to seeking the sustainable sourcing of materials, prioritising circular alternatives in our supply chain and safeguarding the health and safety of the workforce. These efforts are in line with the cascading principle of renewable resource use, which emphasises responsible and efficient utilisation of resources. Elisa engages consumers in circular thinking, for example by increasing awareness and promoting device recycling through incentives for customers. We also continue to expand our sustainable and circular offerings, for example through device-as-a-service business models. Resource inflows Manufactured electronic devices, network technologies and batteries make up the majority of inflowing materials. We utilise these technologies to operate our networks and to provide services and products to our customers and end users. These devices and technologies utilise metals and minerals, including some critical and rare materials. Many of these materials have few or no available substitutes and cannot be replaced. Additionally, the inflow also includes batteries, which can include some precious metals. Resource inflows in 2024 Total weight of resource inflow products including packaging (kg) 79,199,692 Percentage of biological materials including packaging (%) 0.4 The absolute weight of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials including packaging (kg) 0 Percentage of secondary reused or recycled components, secondary intermediary products and secondary materials (%) 0 Accounting principles – Resource inflows The data includes Elisa Corporation (Finland) and Elisa Eesti As as the resource inflow is most relevant to these businesses. The total weight of products includes all of the manufactured materials, electronic devices and network technologies procured during 2024. The weight data is collected from Elisa’s procurement system, where the supplier provided data is used when available. In case such data is not available, we have used researched estimations. The biological material used or acquired is insignificant, thus we estimate it to be close to zero. Weight and share of secondary reused or recycled materials are estimated to be negligible and thus zero, as we do not have adequate and accurate data to do any justified calculations. To ensure accuracy, we have diligently avoided double counting by using the data from Elisa’s procurement system only once and have used third party assurance of data and calculations. 76 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
"Resource outflows – Waste Elisa does not manufacture or produce any of the products it offers in the market. Elisa operates as a retailer, supplying products to customers. In this capacity, the resource inflows and outflows – including the products and their packaging volumes – are nearly equivalent. Concerning our network operations, facilities, office premises and businesses, our resource outflows result mainly from electronic waste, which typically includes network equipment, other electronics and batteries (both rechargeable and non-rechargeable) and in addition packaging. The amount of office waste is minimal in Elisa’s waste volume, and we adhere to the waste management principles of reducing, reusing and recycling, in collaboration with local waste management partners. Elisa operates under the Extended Producer Responsibility principles by recycling electronic devices, batteries and accu­ mulators, as well as packaging material. Replaced network equipment is either reused in our own operations, sold to the second-hand market or recycled through our third-party partner. The pieces of equipment that are handed over to a third-party partner for further refurbishment and sales are first collected and examined by Elisa to assess whether they are commercially viable, before being packaged for transporta­ tion. Our shops in Finland and Estonia have WEEE collection receptacles for consumer electronic consumables, through which e.g. devices are taken for re-processing to become materials for new electronic products. Our shops in Finland have specific collection boxes for recycling mobile devices and other portable devices. We offer monetary compensation for phones eligible for reuse, for example, when purchasing a new device. Collected devices are repaired, refurbished and reintroduced to the market for consumers, contributing to the circular economy. Additionally, Elisa also complies with local laws as part of producer responsibility, for example in Finland regarding the recycling of packing waste Total waste generated in 2024 Total amount of waste (kg) 838,763 Non-recycled waste (kg) 219,803 Non-recycled waste (%) 26 Total amount of hazardous waste (kg) 356,435 Total waste diverted from disposal (kg) 675,699 Hazardous waste (kg) 356,415 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 356,415 Other recovery operations (kg) N/A Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 319,284 Preparation for reuse (kg) N/A Recycling (kg) 262,545 Other recovery operations (kg) 56,739 Total waste directed to disposal (kg) 163,065 Hazardous waste (kg) 20 Incineration (kg) N/A Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) 20 Non-hazardous Waste (kg) 163,045 Incineration (kg) 163,045 Landfill (kg) N/A Other disposal operations (kg) N/A Accounting principles – Resource outflows – Waste The data includes all Elisa group companies as reported in Elisa’s financial statements. Elisa’s waste volumes consist of materials generated directly across various facilities (such as offices, shops and network infrastructure sites) and are predominantly linked to our business operations. Most of the waste is comprised of battery waste and WEEE (encompassing technology equipment and consumer electronic products), as well as metal and packaging waste. In addition, office waste forms a minor portion of our total waste volume and typically includes materials such as paper, cardboard and biowaste. The composition of these waste streams includes several types of materials, notably minerals, metals and critical materials from technology equipment and batteries, plastics from packaging materials and biomass from office biowaste. Waste data is systematically gathered through reports from our waste management partners or building management, ensuring accuracy. In cases where actual data is unavailable, particularly in certain office locations, estimates based on office headcount are used, as this directly correlates with waste generation. However, the estimated data amounts to less than 3 percent of Elisa’s total waste volume. 77 ANNUAL REPORT 2024 Sustainability Statement General information Social Governance Assurance Annexes Environment"
