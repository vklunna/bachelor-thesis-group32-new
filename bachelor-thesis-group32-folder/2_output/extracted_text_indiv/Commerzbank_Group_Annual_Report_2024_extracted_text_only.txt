"92 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 amounts of numerator and denominator therefore differ signifi- cantly from one another. The exposure that is relevant for the numerator is generally exposure towards companies that are required to submit a non- financial report (NFR) in accordance with the Accounting Di- rective. In order to identify these companies, we used data from an external data provider on companies required to publish a non-financial report, which we combined with our customer in- formation. Certain exposure towards households and towards lo- cal and regional authorities is also taken into account. In the case of special financing for special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that are not regularly required to submit a non-financial report, we ap- plied a “look-through” approach. Here, we consider the use of proceeds to be most important and are including this accordingly in the reporting. Two procedures are used to screen our assets for Taxonomy eligibility or Taxonomy alignment. A distinction is made based on whether the use of the proceeds by the borrower/issuer is un- known (general-purpose loans and securities) or known (loans with use of proceeds). General-purpose loans and securities are weighted using the turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs of the borrower/issuer and are thus included in the calculation of the GAR in the two calculation variants. The calculation of the GAR and AuM KPIs includes equities with the issuer’s turnover-based or CapEx-based KPIs as well as certain funds (according to Article 8 and Article 9 of the Disclo- sure Regulation) with the product-specific KPI. We do not carry out a “look-through” approach for other funds. For bonds where the proceeds were allocated to a specific sustainable purpose, the issuers have not yet provided product-specific KPIs whose calcu- lation methodology meets the Taxonomy requirements. Until the newly enacted EU Green Bond Standard is applicable and prod- uct-specific Taxonomy KPIs are available, all bonds will be as- sessed using the issuer’s turnover-based and CapEx-based KPIs. The counterparty KPIs are obtained from an external data pro- vider. The information provided refers to the companies’ disclo- sures for the 2023 reporting year. If no information was available, we assessed these positions as Taxonomy-non-eligible or Taxon- omy-non-aligned. Exposure towards subsidiaries required to publish a non-financial report with parent companies also re- quired to publish a non-financial report are assessed based on the parent company’s disclosed KPIs. For the 2024 reporting year, subsidiaries that are not subject to reporting were included for the first time. If there are no sep- arate KPIs for the subsidiaries, the KPIs of the parent company are also used, significantly increasing the volume of assets ana- lysed compared with the previous year. This expanded scope was based on FAQ 13 issued by the EU Commission, which was pub- lished in the Official Journal in November 2024.The expansion to include the customer group of local/regional authorities on the basis of FAQ 47 also increased the assessment population. The total covered assets therefore increased compared to the previ- ous year (see Template 0; % of total assets covered in the 2024 financial year at 41.31%, in the previous year 2023 still at 32.98%). When screening loans where a use of proceeds is know, the review is based on the information provided by the borrower about the activities for which the proceeds are used. If the use of funds (financed economic activity) is described in the Taxonomy Regulation, we assess these loans as Taxonomy-eligible. In order to determine whether an exposure can be classified as Taxonomy-aligned, we examine the comprehensive technical screening criteria, which differ depending on the economic ac- tivity. A check is also carried out to determine that none of the other objectives are significantly impaired and that the criteria for social minimum safeguards are met. We have established appropriate procedures to assess Taxon- omy eligibility and Taxonomy alignment. We rolled out further software solutions in 2024 that allow us to implement (partially) automated processes when screening for Taxonomy alignment, making the process more streamlined and efficient. We generally assess Taxonomy alignment for Taxonomy-eli- gible exposure that is essential to our business activities and, where necessary, introduce new processes to collect relevant in- formation about our customers. In cases where we did not have access to the required infor- mation and evidence (for checking the technical screening crite- ria) and this could not be ascertained with reasonable effort, we classified these items as Taxonomy-non-aligned. The KPIs were calculated using the Bank’s central data ware- house, which also forms the basis for the financial reporting (FINREP). The mBank data was collected locally and then inte- grated into the Group-wide figures. The calculation was based on gross carrying amounts. The green asset ratio in the reporting period is as follows:"

Our Taxonomy-aligned volume and thus the green asset ratio (GAR stock) is characterised by retail mortgage financing and spe- cial financing for SPVs in the field of renewable energies. The Tax- onomy alignment check for the 2024 reporting year was extended to financing outside the European Economic Area. The share of to- tal environmentally sustainable assets (for which the use of pro- ceeds is known) increases to 2.93% (see Template 0; previous year: 2.28 %). The total GAR stock increases by 42% to 3.33% (turno- ver KPI; previous year: 2.34%) and 48% to 3.59% (CapEx KPI; previous year: 2.43%). Although the taxonomy-aligned business increases significantly overall, the effect is mitigated by a similar increase in the size of the denominator (total GAR assets). The current reporting of Taxonomy-aligned assets refers to en- vironmental objectives 1 (climate change mitigation) and 2 (cli- mate change adaptation), as it did for the 2023 reporting year. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2486 of 27 June 2023 supple- mented the EU Taxonomy with technical screening criteria for four additional environmental objectives. With respect to the four addi- tional environmental objectives, financial institutions will initially only have to provide information regarding Taxonomy eligibility for the 2023 and 2024 reporting years. The full reporting requirements for Taxonomy alignment will apply starting from the 2025 report- ing year. Accordingly, the columns in the templates for data on Tax- onomy alignment for the environmental objectives – three to six have been left empty. Taxonomy-eligible activities must be assigned to one – specifi- cally– the most relevant – environmental objective. Double count- ing is not permitted. The Taxonomy eligibility of loans with a 7 FAQ 29 issued by the EU Commission in November 2024 requires banks to add an- other nine nuclear and gas templates to all KPIs. For the 2024 reporting year, this would correspond to 27 nearly empty templates. purpose known use of proceeds was screened for all six environ- mental objectives. The loans are consequently assigned to the first environmental objective. There is no remaining amount that is al- located to other environmental objectives. For general-purpose loans and securities, the company KPIs were used. For the 2024 financial year, the availability of KPIs improved significantly; more- over, KPIs could be used for the first time for Taxonomy alignment of financial institutions. The extension of the EU Taxonomy to include nuclear and gas entered into force on 1 January 2023, so the corresponding data for companies – and, for the first time, also for financial institutions – will be included in this report for the first time (for general-pur- pose loans and securities). The financed economic activities in the nuclear and gas sector are part of the GAR (stock). In addition, we are required to report the shares in the GAR (stock) in separate templates in the Notes. We have not provided any further templates for the additional KPIs for reasons of non-materiality and readabil- ity.7 We have not identified any loans with a purpose in the nuclear and gas sector. Commerzbank’s own understanding of sustainability in these activities is described in greater detail in the ESG framework. We have a principle of not financing any new nuclear power plants. The same is true for uranium mines. We have strict requirements for assets involving fossil fuels and generally take a critical view of such exposure. At the same time, we see the need for gas as a tran- sition technology over the coming years to ensure continued sta- bility of supply. We therefore critically scrutinise financing for the construction of gas-fired power plants on a case-by-case basis."
"94 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-1] Transition plan for climate change mitigation Commerzbank aims to actively shape the transformation towards a sustainable economy. To achieve this, we have established a comprehensive sustainability strategy, with the core objective of becoming a Net-Zero Bank. Further information on key compo- nents of this sustainability strategy can be found in ESRS E1-2 and E1-4. So far, Commerzbank has not published an explicit transition plan for climate change mitigation, as required under ESRS E1-1. We are currently developing such a climate transition plan, in which we will disclose further information about our transfor- mation path. Approval by the Bank’s Board of Managing Direc- tors and subsequent publication of the climate transition plan are earmarked for 2025. [E1-2] Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Banking operations Commerzbank AG has set itself the goal of reducing emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2040. This applies to all locations in Germany and abroad. Unavoidable CO2eq emissions are offset by certificates from CO2eq reduction projects. Renew- able energies play a central role in our energy supply. Further- more, we aim to achieve a climate-neutral supplier portfolio by 2040. Our strategies incorporate climate change mitigation, energy efficiency and other environmental criteria in accordance with the principles of the UN Global Compact. In implementing our goals, we are committed to complying with relevant standards and initiatives enacted by third parties, including in particular the Paris Agreement, the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the UN Global Compact. In addition, we are a member of the Association for Environmental Manage- ment and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (Verein für Um- weltmanagement und Nachhaltigkeit in Finanzinstituten e. V. (VfU)). With these strategies and policies, Commerzbank is respond- ing to the material impacts of its business activities. By publicly communicating our climate change mitigation targets, we can set a benchmark and have a positive influence on competitors. These overarching objectives, strategies and standards apply to all sustainability policies in relation to banking operations and are publicly available on our website. ESG framework Our ambitious sustainability targets are published and described in our ESG framework. The core components of the framework that are central to banking operations include sustainable opera- tions and stakeholder management. Responsibility for the ESG framework lies with Group Sustain- ability Management, while Group Organisation & Security over- sees implementation of sustainable operations. The ESG framework applies to Commerzbank AG as well as to selected subsidiaries. Commerzbank emphasises great importance to communica- tion with all stakeholders, encompassing our customers, inves- tors, rating agencies, analysts, non-governmental organisations, policymakers and the general public. We keep in contact with our major stakeholders through personal dialogue, discussion events, strategic partnerships and various public communication chan- nels. Progress is monitored by means of an annual process for col- lecting, analysing and reporting relevant operational-environ- mental sustainability indicators. Commerzbank environmental guidelines Our comprehensive environmental guidelines outline the princi- ples of environmentally friendly business activities. These guide- lines are based on international standards and take into account all relevant aspects along our entire value chain, including the core elements of corporate responsibility, climate change mitiga- tion and climate change adaptation, resource-conserving energy use, prevention of environmental damage, promotion of biodiver- sity, transition to a circular economy, climate-neutral supplier portfolio, mobility of our employees and ongoing improvements to our environmental performance. The environmental guidelines adopted by the Board of Managing Directors serve as operating procedures for all employees of the Commerzbank Group. The Group Organisation & Security division is responsible for imple- mentation. Our environmental and energy management system"

This underlines our commitment to continuously improve our environmental perfor- mance and energy efficiency. Regular reports to the Board of Di- rectors ensure the effectiveness of our management systems. Standard for sustainable procurement With its standard for sustainable procurement, Commerzbank has laid down binding guidelines governing sustainability mat- ters when purchasing goods and services. The environmental, so- cial and governance criteria specified in the standard reflect Commerzbank’s corporate responsibility demands of its service providers and suppliers. Therefore, Commerzbank also actively influences the sustainable orientation of suppliers and service providers through purchasing decisions. The regulations defined by Corporate Procurement are binding for all units of Commerzbank AG both in Germany and abroad. The target group includes all process participants involved in procurement. The standard serves as a framework for subsidiar- ies in Germany and abroad when making internal decisions based on company-specific requirements. The standard for sustainable procurement promotes sustain- able development in the procurement process. The defined crite- ria and rules of conduct are intended to make the consideration of sustainability aspects practicable for all process partici- pants. In addition, the standard aims to raise awareness among Commerzbank employees on the topic of sustainability. Within the context of the internal control system, controls have been defined for evaluating suppliers prior to entering into new contractual relationships as well as for managing existing suppli- ers. These also include ESG criteria as a part of an overall scoring model. When selecting suppliers, Commerzbank’s Reputational Risk Management analyses the suppliers on a case-by-case basis. The commissioning organisational units and Corporate Procure- ment evaluate service providers to ensure compliance with the requirements outlined in the standard. We notify suppliers of any necessary improvements in terms of sustainability performance and document the results of the assessments. Banking business Commerzbank AG’s climate change mitigation targets in the cus- tomer business and the steps required to achieve these objectives are explicitly governed by the ESG framework and the associated internal “ESG Framework Policy”. In this policy and the underly- ing procedures, Commerzbank AG sets out the building blocks of its sustainability strategy and describes how the three sustaina- bility KPIs are managed:  Net zero carbon emissions in the loan and investment portfo- lio by 2050  Mobilising €300bn in sustainable products by 2025  Net zero carbon emissions in banking operations by 2040 One concrete goal is therefore to create transparency in our sustainability activities, including a clear definition of what ESG means in our customer business. The framework also presents our sustainable product solutions and consolidates the sustaina- bility guidelines and exclusion criteria. Commerzbank published a revised framework in February 2025, which has been updated to include an expanded and optimised set of sustainability targets and has undergone a fundamental redesign in terms of structure. Climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation are addressed in the ESG framework and in the corresponding policy, primarily through the net zero target, SBTi management, binding exclusion criteria and minimum standards, consideration of cli- mate matters in risk management, as well as by financing sus- tainable projects and offering sustainable products. The topic of renewable energies is addressed through financing for projects in this area, for example through the Centre of Competence Green Infrastructure Finance. The main objective of the framework and internal policy is to create a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent management of the relevant products, processes and activities, paving the way for the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank AG. The ESG framework therefore describes both Commerzbank’s impacts on the environment (“Save the World” perspective) and the environ- ment’s impacts on Commerzbank AG (“Save the Bank” perspec- tive), encompassing both the risk and impact perspectives of the associated business activities. Significant opportunities arise in the sustainability context from sustainable product solutions (fi- nancing and investments), which are covered by the €300bn tar- get. Commerzbank AG’s sustainability efforts as described in the framework are operationalised and monitored using the three sustainability KPIs. The Group Sustainability Board, a Bank-wide committee focusing on sustainability issues that is attended by members of the Board of Managing Directors, is responsible for the ESG framework. The head of Group Strategy, Transformation & Sustainability division and the steering committee of the stra- tegic initiative “Sustainability 360°” are responsible for the inter- nal policy."
"96 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 The process of developing the ESG framework actively incor- porated the interests of relevant internal and external stakehold- ers (e.g. political bodies, non-governmental organisations, customers and investors) and directly involved internal stake- holders. With regard to the internal policy, all relevant depart- ments were likewise consulted during the drafting process. The ESG framework is available on our website. The internal policy, as part of the written rules of procedure, is available in- ternally to all Commerzbank employees. Various other guidelines and procedures within the Bank, including those from other de- partments, are linked or sub-assigned to the policy. Managing financed emissions via the SBTi Commerzbank has implemented a wide range of internal guide- lines and procedures to manage the requirements under the SBTi. These steering guidelines, which also clarify the roles and re- sponsibilities for SBTi management, outline the minimum stand- ards adopted by Commerzbank for SBTi management both at the level of the overall portfolio and for the individual business seg- ments. The most important guidelines include the following:  The Net Zero (SBTi) Steering Guideline defines roles and re- sponsibilities for net zero and SBTi management and sets minimum standards for managing portfolios and individual business areas.  The Net Zero (SBTi) Portfolio Calculation & Target Setting Procedure defines the SBTi target curves for the portfolios, the relevant sectors and the underlying parameters.  Various other steering guidelines and procedural instructions specify the segment-specific steering requirements for the corporate client business, the private customer business and Treasury. These include control measures, reporting obliga- tions, and roles and responsibilities. The target group of these guidelines, which were approved by the relevant competent authorities, are the responsible divisions within Commerzbank AG. The overarching Net Zero (SBTi) Steer- ing Guideline was also initially approved by the Group-wide sus- tainability project at Board level, following alignment with the relevant stakeholders. The internal guidelines form part of the written framework and are available internally to all employees of Commerzbank AG. The key principles of portfolio management under the SBTi are also communicated externally as part of the ESG framework. The process of developing the SBTi target pathways is subject to regular monitoring and quarterly updates to senior manage- ment, including the Board of Managing Directors of Com- merzbank, by means an internal report detailing the progress made on achieving the SBTi targets. A traffic light system was developed in 2024 to evaluate deviations in actual development from the target curves and devise appropriate countermeasures where necessary, depending on the extent of deviation from the target pathway. In addition, the SBTi Net Zero Dashboard, de- signed as a controlling instrument, has been continuously ex- panded to improve performance and deliver more meaningful results. Finally, the data basis has been optimised, new real data has been integrated and work has begun on preparing implemen- tation of the new SBTi standard for financial institutions. Our risk management addresses both the physical and transi- tion risks identified in the annual materiality assessment for cli- mate-related risks, while SBTi management addresses the identified impacts. More details on this analysis can be found in ESRS E1 SBM-3. [E1-3] Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies Climate change mitigation measures in banking operations We are conscious of our responsibility as a company and are ac- tively committed to the transformation towards an environmentally sustainable society. Through innovative technologies, energy effi- ciency measures, and the transition to renewable energy sources, we are consistently working on reducing our environmental foot- print. We have established an integrated environmental and energy management system (integriertes Umwelt- und Energiemanage- mentsystem (iUEMS)) in accordance with our environmental guidelines. Since 2009 Commerzbank AG and selected subsidiar- ies have had an environmental management system certified ac- cording to ISO 14001 and since 2015 an energy management system certified according to ISO 50001. This ensures that respon- sibilities, behaviors, processes and guidelines for implementing the corporate environmental and energy policy are systematically defined and documented. The focus is on optimising resource con- sumption, particularly in areas where we can have a direct impact on the environment, such as in building management and business travel."

The topic of renewable energies is addressed through financing for projects in this area, for example through the Centre of Competence Green Infrastructure Finance. The main objective of the framework and internal policy is to create a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent management of the relevant products, processes and activities, paving the way for the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank AG. The ESG framework therefore describes both Commerzbank’s impacts on the environment (“Save the World” perspective) and the environ- ment’s impacts on Commerzbank AG (“Save the Bank” perspec- tive), encompassing both the risk and impact perspectives of the associated business activities. Significant opportunities arise in the sustainability context from sustainable product solutions (fi- nancing and investments), which are covered by the €300bn tar- get. Commerzbank AG’s sustainability efforts as described in the framework are operationalised and monitored using the three sustainability KPIs. The Group Sustainability Board, a Bank-wide committee focusing on sustainability issues that is attended by members of the Board of Managing Directors, is responsible for the ESG framework. The head of Group Strategy, Transformation & Sustainability division and the steering committee of the stra- tegic initiative “Sustainability 360°” are responsible for the inter- nal policy."
"96 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 The process of developing the ESG framework actively incor- porated the interests of relevant internal and external stakehold- ers (e.g. political bodies, non-governmental organisations, customers and investors) and directly involved internal stake- holders. With regard to the internal policy, all relevant depart- ments were likewise consulted during the drafting process. The ESG framework is available on our website. The internal policy, as part of the written rules of procedure, is available in- ternally to all Commerzbank employees. Various other guidelines and procedures within the Bank, including those from other de- partments, are linked or sub-assigned to the policy. Managing financed emissions via the SBTi Commerzbank has implemented a wide range of internal guide- lines and procedures to manage the requirements under the SBTi. These steering guidelines, which also clarify the roles and re- sponsibilities for SBTi management, outline the minimum stand- ards adopted by Commerzbank for SBTi management both at the level of the overall portfolio and for the individual business seg- ments. The most important guidelines include the following:  The Net Zero (SBTi) Steering Guideline defines roles and re- sponsibilities for net zero and SBTi management and sets minimum standards for managing portfolios and individual business areas.  The Net Zero (SBTi) Portfolio Calculation & Target Setting Procedure defines the SBTi target curves for the portfolios, the relevant sectors and the underlying parameters.  Various other steering guidelines and procedural instructions specify the segment-specific steering requirements for the corporate client business, the private customer business and Treasury. These include control measures, reporting obliga- tions, and roles and responsibilities. The target group of these guidelines, which were approved by the relevant competent authorities, are the responsible divisions within Commerzbank AG. The overarching Net Zero (SBTi) Steer- ing Guideline was also initially approved by the Group-wide sus- tainability project at Board level, following alignment with the relevant stakeholders. The internal guidelines form part of the written framework and are available internally to all employees of Commerzbank AG. The key principles of portfolio management under the SBTi are also communicated externally as part of the ESG framework. The process of developing the SBTi target pathways is subject to regular monitoring and quarterly updates to senior manage- ment, including the Board of Managing Directors of Com- merzbank, by means an internal report detailing the progress made on achieving the SBTi targets. A traffic light system was developed in 2024 to evaluate deviations in actual development from the target curves and devise appropriate countermeasures where necessary, depending on the extent of deviation from the target pathway. In addition, the SBTi Net Zero Dashboard, de- signed as a controlling instrument, has been continuously ex- panded to improve performance and deliver more meaningful results. Finally, the data basis has been optimised, new real data has been integrated and work has begun on preparing implemen- tation of the new SBTi standard for financial institutions. Our risk management addresses both the physical and transi- tion risks identified in the annual materiality assessment for cli- mate-related risks, while SBTi management addresses the identified impacts. More details on this analysis can be found in ESRS E1 SBM-3. [E1-3] Actions and resources in relation to climate change policies Climate change mitigation measures in banking operations We are conscious of our responsibility as a company and are ac- tively committed to the transformation towards an environmentally sustainable society. Through innovative technologies, energy effi- ciency measures, and the transition to renewable energy sources, we are consistently working on reducing our environmental foot- print. We have established an integrated environmental and energy management system (integriertes Umwelt- und Energiemanage- mentsystem (iUEMS)) in accordance with our environmental guidelines. Since 2009 Commerzbank AG and selected subsidiar- ies have had an environmental management system certified ac- cording to ISO 14001 and since 2015 an energy management system certified according to ISO 50001. This ensures that respon- sibilities, behaviors, processes and guidelines for implementing the corporate environmental and energy policy are systematically defined and documented. The focus is on optimising resource con- sumption, particularly in areas where we can have a direct impact on the environment, such as in building management and business travel."

In- troducing green district heating at our headquarters also cut indi- rect emissions in Scope 2 by around 800 t CO2eq. For the 2025 financial year, Commerzbank AG expects a further decrease in di- rect Scope 1 emissions of approximately 700 t CO2eq, achieved by optimising the use of space at a major German location. These measures are important decarbonisation levers. The financial re- sources to implement the above-mentioned measures are available. In addition to the measures described, further initiatives are in discussion to help us achieve our climate targets. We are commit- ted to expanding our contribution to climate change mitigation and shaping a sustainable future together with our partners. Financial resources for implementing measures The CapEx and OpEx indicators are not suitable for the banking sector and therefore are not applicable, which is why we do not report the KPIs related to CapEx and OpEx. This is supported by the Taxonomy Regulation, which in Article 8 refers to turnover, CapEx (capital expenditure) and OpEx (operational expenditure) as key performance indicators for non-financial companies. Climate change mitigation in customer business A key driver of Commerzbank’s efforts to have a positive impact on climate change and a core element of its sustainability strat- egy is the Bank’s strategic target of reducing carbon emissions from its entire loan and investment portfolio to Net-Zero by 2050. To achieve this goal, Commerzbank has identified and ana- lysed carbon-intensive industries in its portfolio based on the methodological guidelines of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and defined target pathways until 2030 for reducing greenhouse gases based on scientifically calculated targets. 8 Base value: 38,507 tonnes CO2eq Using the SBTi method, Commerzbank has set concrete sector- specific targets for reducing the physical carbon emissions inten- sity associated with its loan and investment portfolio (including “financed emissions”) with a view to achieving its Net-Zero com- mitment by 2050.

[E1-4] Targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Setting GHG emissions reduction targets in banking operations As a core driver part of our sustainability strategy, we have set ourselves the goal of reducing carbon emissions from Com- merzbank AG’s banking operations to Net-Zero by 2040. This in- cludes all direct and indirect emissions that are under our operational control. We also aim to have a climate-neutral sup- plier portfolio by 2040. In setting our targets, we considered the interests of our stakeholders as well as the climate-related im- pacts, risks and opportunities categorised as material at that time. The reduction targets support the management of these factors in banking operations based on the double materiality analysis (see SBM-3). For Commerzbank AG and selected subsidiaries, a GHG re- duction target for banking operations has been set in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). It envisages a 42% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 2030 com- pared to the base year 20218. This target has been validated by the SBTi as scientifically based and consistent with the Paris Agreement climate targets. Our targets refer to CO2eq, which includes CO2 as well as other relevant greenhouse gases and ensures consistency with our CO2eq accounting. As part of the first-time application of CSRD requirements in the Bank’s sustainability reporting, 2024 has been defined as the new base year."

"98 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 Setting greenhouse gas reduction targets in our banking business For Commerzbank’s business model as a universal bank, fi- nanced emissions under Scope 3 are the main driver of green- house gas emissions. Cutting these emissions is a key goal of Commerzbank’s sustainability strategy, which is why since 2021 Commerzbank AG has set itself the strategic target of reducing carbon emissions in its entire loan and investment portfolio to Net-Zero by 2050. This target and the steps defined to achieve it are also disclosed in Commerzbank’s ESG framework (see ESRS E1-3). An interim target for the absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is not planned at the present time. Managing emis- sions-intensive sectors through relative targets takes portfolio growth opportunities into account and in the long term will also reduce the financed emissions in absolute terms. To that end, Commerzbank AG has identified and analysed carbon-intensive sectors in its portfolio based on the methodo- logical guidelines laid down by the Science Based Target Initia- tive (SBTi). When setting its SBTi targets, Commerzbank used SBTi-aligned methodologies that apply the Sectoral Decarboni- zation Approach and aim to limit global warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C. The targets are in line with international policy objec- tives such as the Paris Agreement and the EU’s climate targets. For its science-based approach, the SBTi uses climate science models such as the pathways defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as scenarios developed by established players like the International Energy Agency (IEA). These determine the global carbon budget required to limit warming to 1.5 °C or well below 2 °C. Based on the climate sci- ence models mentioned above, the SBTi develops sector-specific criteria and methodologies that allow companies to set their own emissions reduction targets consistent with these pathways. These sector-specific decarbonisation pathways also take into ac- count the broader context of sustainable development by incor- porating relevant environmental, social and economic factors and pay attention to specific regional impacts exerted by the Bank’s business activities. In addition, the SBTi reviews and approves companies’ individual targets by means of a validation process to confirm that they meet the relevant criteria. This ensures that they are consistent with the latest climate science and best prac- tices for reducing emissions. Implementation at Commerzbank AG All portfolios specified according to the SBTi method are man- aged with a focus on emissions-intensive sectors. These include power generation, aviation, automotive manufacturing, commer- cial real estate finance (residential and commercial use) and the production of cement, iron and steel. The private residential mortgage loan portfolio, which is deemed optional in the SBTi analysis, is also considered. By taking into account the most car- bon-intensive elements of the overall economic value chain, it can be assumed that if these sectors are transformed, other parts of the portfolio will be transformed as well. Corresponding emis- sions intensity reduction targets by 2030 were formulated for all these portfolios for the first time in 2022 and subsequently vali- dated by the SBTi in 2023. As announced in September 2023, Commerzbank has joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). Therefore, in 2023 we also adapted our meth- odology for calculating portfolio intensities to the internationally recognised PCAF standard. In the course of applying this stand- ard, we additionally recalculated the starting point in the base year 2021 and determined new target values for 2030. The tar- gets remained as ambitious as before, or became slightly more ambitious, because the sectors of cement and steel were moved from a 1.8°C pathway to a 1.5°C pathway. We still await final con- firmation of the adjusted targets from the SBTi revalidation pro- cess. Methodological updates required by SBTi or PCAF moving forward will be reviewed and, depending on the decision, incor- porated as needed in accordance with the prescribed transition periods. Another development was the SBTi Net-Zero Dashboard, which serves as a controlling instrument for the SBTi-relevant sectors. The dashboard provides an overview of the emissions intensities in the individual portfolios and shows the relation to the respective SBTi reduction pathway. As part of the SBTi framework, two methods are applied for this Net-Zero target: first, the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA), a method for setting sector-specific intensity targets; and second, the Temperature Score approach, which helps financial institutions determine the current temperature score of their portfolio based on the public emissions reduction targets of their borrowers. The following tables show the carbon reduction pathways we have defined up to 2030, broken down by SDA sectors and using the temperature score approach."

Assessing performance The percentage reductions in the specified sectors are derived from the applicable emissions intensity for the base year 2021 and the targets for 2030. The emissions intensities were calculated using the loan transactions and investments that were actually carried out and are relevant for the balance sheet. The SBTi also requires min- imum levels of portfolio coverage; Commerzbank complies with these thresholds. Achieving the SBTi reduction pathways presents a necessary challenge and a vital opportunity at the same time – something that Commerzbank would like to tackle together with its customers. In order to reduce sector-specific emissions intensities, customers in Commerzbank’s portfolio must undertake major transformation ef- forts by themselves. Ultimately, however, the green transformation is a joint undertaking of the entire real and financial economy, as well as politics and society. The SDA-relevant loan and investment portfolio consists of cus- tomers whose main activities can be attributed to the most carbon- intensive industrial sectors. The main drivers of sector-specific emissions intensities are the portfolio composition resulting from customers’ drawdown patterns (i.e. utilisations), and the carbon emissions intensities of the respective customers themselves. Since the variables mentioned are subject to certain fluctuations over time, the sector intensities shown also exhibit volatility in the same way. In the area of energy generation, the Commerzbank portfolio at the end of September 2024 performed much better than the target pathway. Of particular note here is the Bank’s strategic focus on project financing in the area of renewable energies. Commerzbank plans to expand this position further over the next few years. The emissions intensity trend in the customer portfolio is also largely satisfactory in the automotive manufacturing, iron and steel sectors. Developments are challenging, especially in the cement sector as well as in the private and commercial real estate finance sector. The trend in the cement sector is primarily due to changes in the total lending of individual large corporate clients with a high carbon intensity in 2022, which so far could not be offset. Commerzbank had not yet established SBTi steering back in 2022. In real estate financing – in contrast to other sectors – the extent to which a trans- formation can be implemented in the sometimes very long-term ex- isting business is limited for legal reasons. It is to be expected that existing business will also improve thanks to increasing modernisa- tion and the use of sustainable energy sources. However, the time horizon involved is very long-term and the process cannot be ac- tively controlled by the Bank. The lever for transforming these port- folios lies much more in new business. The nationwide collapse in the real estate finance business, due in part to the extensive con- struction freezes on the back of market uncertainties and price in- creases, therefore had a negative impact on achieving targets in this sub-portfolio. Future developments here will be heavily dependent on a possible upswing in the new construction business as well as on the political and legal framework conditions supporting the transformation. At present, it cannot be ruled out that these portfo- lios will not achieve their targets."
"To our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 101 47 Sustainability Report 302 Basis of the Commerzbank Group 309 Economic report 319 Segment performance 322 Information on Commerzbank AG (HGB) 325 Outlook and opportunities report Incorporation of SBTi targets in steering Commerzbank also takes SBTi targets into account in its portfolio steering. For the steering of significant individual transactions in carbon-intensive sectors, a process has been established for evalu- ating relevant exposures in relation to the strategic sustainability targets, including the Net-Zero (SBTi) sector target pathways. This process has been in place since 2021 and is continuously updated and enhanced. The tools for SBTi portfolio steering will be progres- sively expanded. The steering was operationalised further in the 2024 reporting year. Working with existing and new customers, we aim to achieve the targets using the following measures:  Sector-specific client engagement dialogue, particularly in emis- sions-intensive sectors, and provision of dedicated human re- sources for this purpose  Customer-specific transformation advice, including the financ- ing instruments required for the transformation  Classification of customers according to SBTi aspects, develop- ment of operational target pathways, and translation of targets into measures and financing solutions at customer level  Active credit and investment portfolio management along the SBTi sector pathways  Expansion of the sustainable product range  Differentiated pricing models, on a portfolio-specific basis where feasible  Consistent implementation of the fossil fuel guideline The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is achieved on the basis of internal control targets. These are not reported externally. [E1-6] Gross Scopes 1, 2, 3 and Total GHG emissions Basis for calculating gross GHG emissions from banking operations Commerzbank determines GHG emissions based on the standard of the Association for Environmental Management and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (Verein für Umweltmanagement und Na- chhaltigkeit in Finanzinstituten e. V. (VfU)). This is aligned to inter- nationally recognised guidelines such as the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and the Global Re- porting Initiative (GRI). Emissions are calculated as CO2 equivalents (CO2eq), which makes it possible to compare the climate impact of different greenhouse gases. The GHG Protocol considers the follow- ing greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). The use of CO2 equivalents allows companies to express their total green- house gas emissions in a comparable number. For this purpose, consumption is recorded in the respective catego- ries and converted into CO2eq using defined emission factors. The majority of emission factors come from the EcoInvent database, one of the world’s largest databases in the field of environmental ac- counting. The emission factors taken from the database are supple- mented by official country-specific emission factors. We differentiate emissions according to the GHG Protocol into the following globally common categories:  Scope 1 comprises emissions caused directly, for example through the consumption of natural gas, heating oil or fuel.  Scope 2 refers to emissions from purchased energy. These can be calculated both according to the statistical country mix (loca- tion-based method) and according to the actual purchased en- ergy mix (market-based method). Both methods are included in our calculation of total emissions and are reported separately.  Scope 3 relates to other indirect emissions from the upstream and downstream value chain. The significance of emissions was also reassessed as part of CSRD implementation. As a financial institution, our greatest lever for decarbonisation lies in financed emissions (Scope 3.15 cate- gory). Due to the comparatively small share of remaining Scope 3 emissions, these categories were classified as not significant. To maintain continuity with our previous reporting, we will continue to publish Scope 3 emissions within the same scope as before. These comprise other indirect emissions from the upstream and downstream value chain, including paper and water consumption, waste generation, activities related to fuels and energy, business travel and logistic transport, employee commuting and electricity used in home offices. The consumption data, the collection method and the calculated CO2eq emissions of Commerzbank AG are verified externally by DNV Business Assurance Certification (DNV Business Assurance Zertifizierung GmbH). Reporting according to the CSRD or the ESRS has shifted the organisational boundaries of our reporting and the control ap- proach, from the previously used operational control to a combined financial and operational control. Operational control exists when Commerzbank has an influence on the assets or properties to be recognised, for example through the introduction and implementation of operational guidelines.

"110 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-7] GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits GHG removal and storage Climate change mitigation is an important aspect of our corporate responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecolog- ical footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality car- bon credits. In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforesta- tion. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant” (wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project” (biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised qual- ity standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide so- called Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon off- setting for banking operations. Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally ver- ified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 re- porting year we offset both current emissions and parts of emissions from 2023. Offsetting strategy All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable car- bon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclu- sively through projects with generally recognised quality standards such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Prin- ciples (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market. The focus of the projects we select is on countries in the global South, as these are often the ones most affected by the conse- quences of climate change. We do not remove or store any greenhouse gases in our own operations or in the upstream and downstream value chain.

"To our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 27 27 Declaration on corporate governance pursuant to Sec. 289f and Sec. 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 39 Details pursuant to Sec. 289 and Sec. 315 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) In addition to the statutory requirements pursuant to Sec. 289f and Sec. 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board must report on the Bank’s corporate governance in the declaration on corporate governance. This follows from Principle 23 of the German Corporate Governance Code in the version of 28 April 2022, published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on 27 June 2022, on which this declaration is based. Both Commerzbank AG and the Commerzbank Group attach great importance to responsible and transparent corporate governance aimed at sustainable value creation. That is why the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board expressly support the goals and objectives set out in the German Corporate Governance Code. Recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code Commerzbank AG and its subsidiaries that are required by law to do so declare every year whether the recommendations of the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code have been and are being complied with and explain why individual recommendations are not being implemented. These annual declarations of compliance by the Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board are published on the websites of the individual companies. Commerzbank AG’s declarations can be found at https://investor-relations.commerzbank.com/de/- entsprechenserklaerung. There is also an archive of all the declarations of compliance made since 2002. The declaration valid as of 31 December 2024 was made in November 2024. As can be seen from the wording of the declaration below, Commerzbank AG complies with virtually all of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code; it deviates from them in only one case: Since the submission of the last Declaration of Compliance in November 2023, the recommendations of the “German Corporate Governance Code Commission” in the version of 28 April 2022 – published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on 27 June 2022 – have been and are being complied with, except for the following recommendation: According to Recommendation G.10 Sentence 2 of the Code, the granted long-term variable remuneration components shall be accessible to a member of the Board of Managing Directors only after a period of four years. The remuneration system for members of the Board of Managing Directors, in force since 1 January 2023, deviates from the recommendation, as members of the Board of Managing Directors can access part of their granted long-term incentive variable remuneration (LTI) before the end of the four- year period. The remuneration system provides that beginning with the LTI for the 2023 financial year, subject to the regular deferral period of five years, the LTI is payable in five tranches, each tranche equally split into a cash and a share-based payment. In addition, the share-based payment of the LTI is subject to a twelve-month retention period. This means that the members of the Board of Managing Directors receive 50% of the LTI before four full years have elapsed. The details are illustrated in the remuneration system for the Board of Managing Directors, which is published on the homepage. The payment of the LTI in tranches is consistent with the bank-specific regulatory requirements set out in the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungsverordnung). A further tightening of these bank-specific requirements is neither necessary nor appropriate. Concurrently, this system achieves a closer link between the payout of the LTIs and the success of the financial year for which the LTI-components are paid. Thereby, the members of the Board of Managing Directors are more directly incentivised. The remuneration system for the members of the Board of Managing Directors was revised and advanced in the 2024 financial year. The new remuneration system for members of the Board of Managing Directors will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting in May 2025 for approval and is expected to come into effect on 1 January 2026. The revised system is consistent with recommendation G.10 sentence 2 of the Code, so that, when it will enter into force in 2026, there will no longer be any deviation to declare in this regard. Further details on the new remuneration system for the Board of Managing Directors can be found on page 38, in the publication of the remuneration system on Commerzbank AG’s website and in the outlook on the new remuneration system that is contained in the remuneration report for the 2024 financial year under the AktG. Suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code Commerzbank AG complies with all of the suggestions of the German Corporate Governance Code.

"28 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 Code recommendations not applicable because of overriding statutory provisions The German Corporate Governance Code states that its recommendations for banks and insurance companies only apply to the extent that no statutory provisions conflict with them. In accordance with recommendation F.4 of the Code, any conflicting statutory provisions and the effects on the declaration of compliance are to be disclosed in the declaration on corporate governance in the Annual Report. At Commerzbank AG this applies to recommendation D.4 of the Code, according to which the Supervisory Board should establish a nomination committee made up exclusively of shareholder representatives. According to the prevailing view, a general exclusion of employee representatives on the Supervisory Board from membership of a committee is only permissible if there is an objective reason for doing so. Such an objective reason could exist if a committee were to deal exclusively with matters relating only to the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, for example if the sole task of the Nomination Committee were to prepare proposals for the election of shareholder representatives to be put to the Annual General Meeting. Under Sec. 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG), however, the nomination committee of a bank is also assigned other tasks, including tasks for which the involvement of employee representatives is necessary and customary. For example, the nomination committee is tasked with assisting the respective company’s supervisory board in identifying candidates to fill management positions, and in the regular assessment of the management board and the supervisory board. The involvement of employee representatives in these tasks is established practice at Commerzbank AG. Nonetheless, in order to comply with recommendation D.4 of the Code as far as possible, the rules of procedure of the Presiding and Nomination Committee stipulate that the election proposals to be put to the Annual General Meeting be prepared only by the shareholder representatives on the committee. Company values and governance practices of Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft and the Commerzbank Group Commerzbank AG and its subsidiaries are committed to their corporate, environmental and social responsibilities. To ensure sustainable corporate governance, extensive standards were defined in various spheres of activity and published on Commerzbank AG’s website. The corporate values of integrity, performance and responsibility create the basis for the corporate culture. They shape both the way employees interact with each other and their behaviour towards customers, business partners and other stakeholders. These values take high priority at Commerzbank and show that Commerzbank is aware of its corporate responsibility. Based on its corporate values, Commerzbank AG has set out codes of conduct for acting with integrity, which provide all Commerzbank Group employees with a binding framework for lawful and ethically appropriate conduct in the day-to-day working environment. The codes of conduct are reviewed on a regular basis and revised if required; they were most recently revised in the 2024 financial year. In its environmental, social and governance (ESG) framework, Commerzbank AG sets out all the key components of its sustainability strategy and makes sustainability a central management parameter. In this way, the Bank provides its stakeholders with the greatest possible transparency regarding its understanding of sustainability. Commerzbank AG has thereby created a Bank-wide standard that enables rigorous management of all relevant products, processes and activities and ensures the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank. The ESG framework also defines positions and policies on environmental and social issues. These are applied to the evaluation of transactions and business relationships and thus act as important points of reference. The basis for their preparation and regular review is the ongoing monitoring of media and non- governmental organisations (NGOs) on controversial environmental or social issues and regular discussion with NGOs. In addition, specific environmental guidelines have been formulated to guide the management of operational environmental impacts. Board of Managing Directors Commerzbank AG’s Board of Managing Directors is responsible for independently managing the Bank in the company’s best interest. In doing so, it must consider the interests of shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders, with the objective of sustainable value creation. It develops the Bank’s strategic direction, discusses it with the Supervisory Board and ensures its implementation. In addition, it sees that efficient risk management and risk control measures are in place. The Board of Managing Directors simultaneously manages the Commerzbank Group as the Group executive body on the basis of uniform guidelines and exercises general control over all Group companies. It conducts the Bank’s business activities in accordance with the law, the Articles of Association, its rules of procedure, internal guidelines and the provisions of the relevant employment contracts. It cooperates on a basis of trust with Commerzbank AG’s other corporate bodies, the employee representatives and the corporate bodies of other Group companies."
"To our Shareholders Corporate Responsibility Management Report Risk Report Financial Statements Further Information 29 27 Declaration on corporate governance pursuant to Sec. 289f and Sec. 315d of the German Commercial Code (HGB) 39 Details pursuant to Sec. 289 and Sec. 315 of the German Commercial Code (HGB) The composition of the Board of Managing Directors and the responsibilities of its individual members are presented on page 5 of this Annual Report. The work of the Board of Managing Directors is specified in greater detail in its rules of procedure, which may be viewed on Commerzbank AG’s website. The remuneration of the members of the Board of Managing Directors is presented in detail in the remuneration report, which is published on Commerzbank AG’s website. Supervisory Board Commerzbank AG’s Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Board of Managing Directors in its management of the Bank and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance. The Supervisory Board discharges its responsibilities in accordance with legal requirements, the Articles of Association and its rules of procedure. It cooperates closely and on a basis of trust with the Board of Managing Directors in the interests of the Bank. Taking into account the recommendations of the Presiding and Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board decides on the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Managing Directors and, together with the Board of Managing Directors, ensures long-term succession planning. If necessary, external consultants are brought in. The composition of the Supervisory Board and the members of its committees are presented on pages 19 to 21 of this Annual Report, in accordance with recommendation D.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Details of the work of this body, its structure and its control function can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board on pages 6 to 18. Further details on how the Supervisory Board and its committees work can be found in the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, available on Commerzbank AG’s website. The duties of the individual permanent committees are set out in the respective rules of procedure, which can also be viewed on Commerzbank AG’s website. According to recommendation C.1 of the Code, the Supervisory Board should set concrete objectives and draw up a profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. In doing so, it should give consideration to diversity. The Supervisory Board’s skills and expertise profile shall also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues relevant to the Bank. Appointments proposed by the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting should take these objectives into account while also seeking to fulfil the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. The status of implementation is to be disclosed in the form of a qualification matrix in the declaration on corporate governance. In addition, in accordance with recommendation C.2 of the Code, an age limit for members of the Supervisory Board should be specified and disclosed in the declaration on corporate governance. The length of Supervisory Board membership is also to be disclosed in accordance with recommendation C.3 of the Code. Commerzbank AG’s Supervisory Board has approved the following concrete objectives: The composition of the Supervisory Board should be such that, overall, its members have the necessary skills, expertise, experience and knowledge to be able to perform its duties properly. In particular, the Supervisory Board should have all the expertise and experience deemed essential for the activities of the Commerzbank Group. In addition, the legal requirements with regard to special expertise and professional experience of individual members of the Supervisory Board in specific areas must be met (for example, expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing, including sustainability reporting and auditing thereof, as well as in the areas of risk management and risk controlling), and at least one member of the Supervisory Board should have special expertise in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. The members of the Supervisory Board must be able to challenge and monitor the decisions made by the Board of Managing Directors. The members of the Supervisory Board should also be able to devote sufficient time to the performance of their duties. Members should be reliable, and consideration should be given to their commitment, personality, professionalism, integrity and independence. The target is that the Supervisory Board should always have at least eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting who are independent as defined in recommendation C.6 of the Code, and not more than two former members of Commerzbank AG’s Board of Managing Directors. The length of service of the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting should generally not exceed a period of 12 years. The term of office of a member of the Supervisory Board should generally end at the end of the Annual General Meeting following the member’s 72nd birthday. The Supervisory Board has resolved a detailed profile of skills and expertise for its composition, which may be consulted on Commerzbank AG’s website. As can be seen from the following qualification matrix based on a self-assessment by members of the Supervisory Board, all objectives set by the Supervisory Board with regard to its composition, as well as its profile of skills and expertise, had been implemented as of 31 December 2024:"

"110 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-7] GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits GHG removal and storage Climate change mitigation is an important aspect of our corporate responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecolog- ical footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality car- bon credits. In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforesta- tion. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant” (wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project” (biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised qual- ity standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide so- called Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon off- setting for banking operations. Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally ver- ified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 re- porting year we offset both current emissions and parts of emissions from 2023. Offsetting strategy All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable car- bon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclu- sively through projects with generally recognised quality standards such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Prin- ciples (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market.

"110 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-7] GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits GHG removal and storage Climate change mitigation is an important aspect of our corporate responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecolog- ical footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality car- bon credits. In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforesta- tion. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant” (wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project” (biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised qual- ity standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide so- called Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon off- setting for banking operations. Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally ver- ified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 re- porting year we offset both current emissions and parts of emissions from 2023. Offsetting strategy All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable car- bon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclu- sively through projects with generally recognised quality standards such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Prin- ciples (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market. The focus of the projects we select is on countries in the global South, as these are often the ones most affected by the conse- quences of climate change. We do not remove or store any greenhouse gases in our own operations or in the upstream and downstream value chain.

"110 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-7] GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits GHG removal and storage Climate change mitigation is an important aspect of our corporate responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecolog- ical footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality car- bon credits. In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforesta- tion. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant” (wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project” (biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised qual- ity standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide so- called Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon off- setting for banking operations. Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally ver- ified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 re- porting year we offset both current emissions and parts of emissions from 2023. Offsetting strategy All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable car- bon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclu- sively through projects with generally recognised quality standards such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Prin- ciples (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market. The focus of the projects we select is on countries in the global South, as these are often the ones most affected by the conse- quences of climate change. We do not remove or store any greenhouse gases in our own operations or in the upstream and downstream value chain.

We have developed a wide range of activities, measures and objectives for this purpose, which we describe in de- tail in ESRS E4-2 to E4-6. At the present time, however, Com- merzbank does not have a comprehensive transition plan on this topic, since this was identified as immaterial for us during the ma- teriality assessment. In addition, the methodological basis and data availability needed to draw up such a transition plan currently fall short of requirements. Commerzbank is actively working to solve these challenges. Further information can be found in ESRS E4-2 to E4-6. Biodiversity risks, like climate risks, are regularly included in the business and sustainability strategy. As part of its annual strategy process, Commerzbank analyses various key indicators and envi- ronmental factors that are relevant to the Bank’s strategy and busi- ness model. This analysis includes both internal perspectives (including employees) and external perspectives (including custom- ers and investors). The results and conclusions from the holistic analysis are used in the downstream strategy process to develop the strategy and business model. Commerzbank also conducts an annual assessment of the mate- riality of biodiversity risks, including their impact on business risks. The results of this analysis are used to help develop the business strategy, the business risk strategy and the various sub-risk strate- gies. For further information on how we incorporate biodiversity into our strategy and business model, please see ESRS E4 SBM-3. [E4-2] Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems Almost all global economic activities depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services. A look at the current state of biodiversity makes it clear that the time for action is now. Dependency and impacts on biodiversity can lead to physical and transition risks – but they can also create opportunities. For this rea- son, the topic of biodiversity is also of strategic importance for Com- merzbank AG. Concepts in Commerzbank’s banking business Commerzbank AG has already adopted specific positions and exclu- sion criteria geared to protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. Im- portant aspects include land use change, pollution and the use of water and marine resources. A major problem concerning land use change is deforestation. To minimise deforestation risks in Commerzbank AG’s portfolio, we have formulated our own position on the topic of deforestation. For more information on this strategy, see ESRS E4-3 and E4-4. Furthermore, in its position on mining, Commerzbank AG ex- cludes the financing of mining projects that use mountain top re- moval (MTR) due to the damage this does to the surrounding area, as well as the financing of companies that mine coal using this method. This mining technique is extremely harmful to the environ- ment and results in significant land use changes. Ecological factors as well as reports of adverse impacts on high conservation value areas and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, for ex- ample in the energy and fossil fuel sectors, are also included in a case-by-case assessment. Taking these factors into account should help to preserve important ecological and cultural regions and mit- igate changes in these areas."
"112 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 With regard to the impacts of pollution on protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, Commerzbank AG also takes a critical view of is- sues such as water and groundwater contamination. The petro- chemical sector is often closely linked with the topic of pollution, particularly water and groundwater contamination. Commerzbank AG therefore subjects business relationships with petrochemical companies and petrochemical projects to a differentiated case-by- case assessment, which can potentially lead to a business relation- ship or project being terminated or denied. Commerzbank AG also takes the topic of water into account within the context of its asset management. Direct investments are excluded in companies where serious compliance violations have been identified with the principles of the UN Global Compact. These comprise, among others, minimum environmental standards with regard to impacts on the sustainable use and conservation of water and marine resources. Investments may be authorised in individual cases if Commerzbank analyses have identified a positive outlook for the company’s development moving forward. On the other hand, the financing that Commerzbank AG provides can also have a positive impact on protecting biodiversity and eco- systems. We classify the financing of nature-related activities as sustainable financing within the meaning of our ESG framework. Our sustainable product solutions include financing sustainable crop cultivation, sustainable forestry, conservation of natural areas and soil remediation. Such financing contributes directly to sustain- able land use. At Commerz Real, compliance with the exclusion criteria of Commerzbank AG in the fund business, for equity investments, in the mandate business and for equipment leasing is already ensured through the business models and through the restrictions imposed on specific asset classes. Concepts in the context of risk management Commerzbank’s overall risk strategy sets out the Bank’s strategic framework and, together with the Bank’s sub-risk strategies, forms the basis for the risk strategies of its subsidiaries. Based on the risk inventory, the overall risk strategy defines biodiversity risks as a horizontal risk driver, meaning that biodiversity risks can have an impact on existing risk types. The strategy also specifies how biodiversity risks should be inte- grated in the risk inventory. The overall risk strategy undergoes a comprehensive review in the second half of each year, before being submitted to the Strategic Risk Committee for a vote and subse- quently to the Board of Managing Directors for approval. The over- all risk strategy is then discussed by the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board and brought to the attention of the Supervisory Board. The ESG Risk Assessment Concept defines the framework for assessing ESG risks for Commerzbank Group, including biodiver- sity risks, and forms part of Commerzbank Group’s stress testing framework. The document specifies the processes, methodological requirements, definitions and result parameters for the risk analysis and is updated annually. The overall document is approved by the Board of Managing Directors. mBank policies mBank has adopted a position on dealing with reputational risk- sensitive industries, which includes the protection of high conser- vation value areas, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other pro- tected areas. This position limits the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduces possible land use changes in these areas. mBank takes due account of environmental risks and oppor- tunities in its lending policy, which sets out requirements that must be met by corporate clients from sectors or economic activities with a high environmental risk as part of the risk assessment process. The directive also includes criteria for sustainability-related financ- ing and defines a classification framework for sustainable loans. mBank does not yet take product traceability into account and has not formulated any explicit positions on the sustainable use of oceans or combating deforestation. [E4-3] Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems Commerzbank AG implements a wide range of measures to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. It has committed itself to the require- ments of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and since 2023 has been guided by the standards and re- quirements outlined in the TNFD in an ongoing effort to comply with these more completely and comprehensively. In addition, Commerzbank AG is an active member of the Biodi- versity in Good Company initiative (BiGCI), as part of which it works together with like-minded companies from the real economy to ad- vocate for the protection and sustainable use of biological diversity, nurturing a productive dialogue and providing valuable insights. Commerzbank AG has also defined various positions and exclu- sion criteria for its core business that contribute to protecting bio- diversity and ecosystems. Further information can be found in section E4-2. The position on deforestation published at the begin- ning of 2024 and the associated target for 2025 represent an im- portant measure in combating land use change. Further information"

Direct investments are excluded in companies where serious compliance violations have been identified with the principles of the UN Global Compact. These comprise, among others, minimum environmental standards with regard to impacts on the sustainable use and conservation of water and marine resources. Investments may be authorised in individual cases if Commerzbank analyses have identified a positive outlook for the company’s development moving forward. On the other hand, the financing that Commerzbank AG provides can also have a positive impact on protecting biodiversity and eco- systems. We classify the financing of nature-related activities as sustainable financing within the meaning of our ESG framework. Our sustainable product solutions include financing sustainable crop cultivation, sustainable forestry, conservation of natural areas and soil remediation. Such financing contributes directly to sustain- able land use. At Commerz Real, compliance with the exclusion criteria of Commerzbank AG in the fund business, for equity investments, in the mandate business and for equipment leasing is already ensured through the business models and through the restrictions imposed on specific asset classes. Concepts in the context of risk management Commerzbank’s overall risk strategy sets out the Bank’s strategic framework and, together with the Bank’s sub-risk strategies, forms the basis for the risk strategies of its subsidiaries. Based on the risk inventory, the overall risk strategy defines biodiversity risks as a horizontal risk driver, meaning that biodiversity risks can have an impact on existing risk types. The strategy also specifies how biodiversity risks should be inte- grated in the risk inventory. The overall risk strategy undergoes a comprehensive review in the second half of each year, before being submitted to the Strategic Risk Committee for a vote and subse- quently to the Board of Managing Directors for approval. The over- all risk strategy is then discussed by the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board and brought to the attention of the Supervisory Board. The ESG Risk Assessment Concept defines the framework for assessing ESG risks for Commerzbank Group, including biodiver- sity risks, and forms part of Commerzbank Group’s stress testing framework. The document specifies the processes, methodological requirements, definitions and result parameters for the risk analysis and is updated annually. The overall document is approved by the Board of Managing Directors. mBank policies mBank has adopted a position on dealing with reputational risk- sensitive industries, which includes the protection of high conser- vation value areas, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and other pro- tected areas. This position limits the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services and reduces possible land use changes in these areas. mBank takes due account of environmental risks and oppor- tunities in its lending policy, which sets out requirements that must be met by corporate clients from sectors or economic activities with a high environmental risk as part of the risk assessment process. The directive also includes criteria for sustainability-related financ- ing and defines a classification framework for sustainable loans. mBank does not yet take product traceability into account and has not formulated any explicit positions on the sustainable use of oceans or combating deforestation. [E4-3] Actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems Commerzbank AG implements a wide range of measures to protect biodiversity and ecosystems. It has committed itself to the require- ments of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), and since 2023 has been guided by the standards and re- quirements outlined in the TNFD in an ongoing effort to comply with these more completely and comprehensively. In addition, Commerzbank AG is an active member of the Biodi- versity in Good Company initiative (BiGCI), as part of which it works together with like-minded companies from the real economy to ad- vocate for the protection and sustainable use of biological diversity, nurturing a productive dialogue and providing valuable insights. Commerzbank AG has also defined various positions and exclu- sion criteria for its core business that contribute to protecting bio- diversity and ecosystems. Further information can be found in section E4-2. The position on deforestation published at the begin- ning of 2024 and the associated target for 2025 represent an im- portant measure in combating land use change. Further information"

The position is aimed at corporate cli- ents in regions and sectors with a high risk of deforestation, such as forestry, soybean cultivation, palm oil production and cattle farm- ing. It requires that these companies provide proof of internationally recognised memberships such as the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) or the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (GRSB), or certifications such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) or the Round Table on Responsible Soy (RTRS) by no later than end-2025. These memberships and certifications require com- panies to adhere to strict rules for protecting biodiversity and eco- systems and include regular audits and reports that document the status and changes in biodiversity. The geographical scope was an- alysed and defined individually for each sector: For the forestry sec- tor, this affects all high-risk areas according to the Forest 500 High Risk Country List; for the palm oil sector it applies worldwide; and for the beef and soy sectors it pertains to the Amazon basin. The relevant countries in the Amazon basin are Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. Commerzbank AG regularly analyses new developments on the topic of deforestation and will adjust its position accordingly if nec- essary. In its business and business relationships in the field of biodi- versity, Commerzbank AG also takes into account indications of hu- man rights violations, including those affecting local communities and indigenous peoples. In addition, the assessment of reputational risk management incorporates a wide range of other factors, partic- ularly in relation to compliance with environmental protection and sustainable land use practices, which in turn help to protect biodi- versity and ecosystems. Further information can be found in our ESG framework, which is available on the Commerzbank website. Commerzbank AG has held various dedicated information events for employees about protecting biological diversity and ecosystems in order to provide information to and raise awareness among its front office staff. At these events, interested employees are intro- duced to the basics of protecting biodiversity and ecosystems, and in particular to the challenges and requirements of our corporate clients; potential financing solutions relating to this topic are also explored. Furthermore, Commerzbank AG plans to expand the quality and quantity of relevant ESG, location and supply chain data in order to improve its risk and impact assessment. The biggest challenges in identifying and managing biodiversity-related impacts and risks are the availability of relevant data and a lack of standardised metrics. When the necessary progress is made in this area, this will facilitate the development of location-based metrics and formulation of fur- ther nature-related positions and targets. For sales, Commerzbank AG plans to integrate additional aspects of protecting biodiversity and ecosystems into its financial products and services, as well as more extensive information initiatives for sales teams. In its sustainability strategy, Commerzbank AG focuses on avoid- ing negative impacts on biodiversity in the customer portfolio. Con- sequently, it does not implement any biodiversity offsetting measures. It is currently not possible to quantify the resources that Com- merzbank spends on biodiversity and ecosystems, as these are es- sentially opportunity costs. However, we are confident that these opportunity costs are offset in at least the same amount by the ben- efits that are derived for both biodiversity and Commerzbank. The risk side of Commerzbank focuses on the execution and further development of risk analyses in order to obtain a more detailed un- derstanding of the Bank’s biodiversity risk profile. These are de- scribed in detail in the section E4 SBM-3. In addition, Commerzbank is also involved in various working groups and asso- ciations, including the Association for Environmental Management and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (VfU), as well as in a pub- lic-private partnership project headed by Wageningen University & Research with the aim of improving quantitative biodiversity risk analysis, also incorporating scenario analyses and stress tests. [E4-4] Targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems An important aspect of Commerzbank AG’s position on deforesta- tion is the concrete target that all corporate clients in the forestry, soy, palm oil and beef sectors in regions with a high risk of defor- estation must demonstrate their commitment to combating defor- estation through relevant memberships such as in RSPO or GRSB or certifications such as FSC, PEFC, RTRS or RSPO by no later than end-2025. Relevant customer relationships are subjected to critical review on a regular and targeted basis to ensure the targets are achieved. The objective is therefore essentially to demonstrate that the customer is committed to preventing and minimising land use change. This includes promoting product traceability, sustainable resources management and transparency in reporting, as well as mitigating the social impacts of biodiversity loss, upholding the rights of local communities and advocating for fair labour practices."
