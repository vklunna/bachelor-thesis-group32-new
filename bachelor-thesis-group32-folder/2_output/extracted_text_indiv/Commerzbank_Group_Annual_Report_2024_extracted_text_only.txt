"94 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-1] Transition plan for climate change mitigation Commerzbank aims to actively shape the transformation towards a sustainable economy. To achieve this, we have established a comprehensive sustainability strategy, with the core objective of becoming a Net-Zero Bank. Further information on key compo- nents of this sustainability strategy can be found in ESRS E1-2 and E1-4. So far, Commerzbank has not published an explicit transition plan for climate change mitigation, as required under ESRS E1-1. We are currently developing such a climate transition plan, in which we will disclose further information about our transfor- mation path. Approval by the Bank’s Board of Managing Direc- tors and subsequent publication of the climate transition plan are earmarked for 2025. [E1-2] Policies related to climate change mitigation and adaptation Banking operations Commerzbank AG has set itself the goal of reducing emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2040. This applies to all locations in Germany and abroad. Unavoidable CO2eq emissions are offset by certificates from CO2eq reduction projects. Renew- able energies play a central role in our energy supply. Further- more, we aim to achieve a climate-neutral supplier portfolio by 2040. Our strategies incorporate climate change mitigation, energy efficiency and other environmental criteria in accordance with the principles of the UN Global Compact. In implementing our goals, we are committed to complying with relevant standards and initiatives enacted by third parties, including in particular the Paris Agreement, the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the UN Global Compact. In addition, we are a member of the Association for Environmental Manage- ment and Sustainability in Financial Institutions (Verein für Um- weltmanagement und Nachhaltigkeit in Finanzinstituten e. V. (VfU)). With these strategies and policies, Commerzbank is respond- ing to the material impacts of its business activities. By publicly communicating our climate change mitigation targets, we can set a benchmark and have a positive influence on competitors. These overarching objectives, strategies and standards apply to all sustainability policies in relation to banking operations and are publicly available on our website. ESG framework Our ambitious sustainability targets are published and described in our ESG framework. The core components of the framework that are central to banking operations include sustainable opera- tions and stakeholder management. Responsibility for the ESG framework lies with Group Sustain- ability Management, while Group Organisation & Security over- sees implementation of sustainable operations. The ESG framework applies to Commerzbank AG as well as to selected subsidiaries. Commerzbank emphasises great importance to communica- tion with all stakeholders, encompassing our customers, inves- tors, rating agencies, analysts, non-governmental organisations, policymakers and the general public. We keep in contact with our major stakeholders through personal dialogue, discussion events, strategic partnerships and various public communication chan- nels. Progress is monitored by means of an annual process for col- lecting, analysing and reporting relevant operational-environ- mental sustainability indicators. Commerzbank environmental guidelines Our comprehensive environmental guidelines outline the princi- ples of environmentally friendly business activities. These guide- lines are based on international standards and take into account all relevant aspects along our entire value chain, including the core elements of corporate responsibility, climate change mitiga- tion and climate change adaptation, resource-conserving energy use, prevention of environmental damage, promotion of biodiver- sity, transition to a circular economy, climate-neutral supplier portfolio, mobility of our employees and ongoing improvements to our environmental performance. The environmental guidelines adopted by the Board of Managing Directors serve as operating procedures for all employees of the Commerzbank Group. The Group Organisation & Security division is responsible for imple- mentation. Our environmental and energy management system"

This underlines our commitment to continuously improve our environmental perfor- mance and energy efficiency. Regular reports to the Board of Di- rectors ensure the effectiveness of our management systems. Standard for sustainable procurement With its standard for sustainable procurement, Commerzbank has laid down binding guidelines governing sustainability mat- ters when purchasing goods and services. The environmental, so- cial and governance criteria specified in the standard reflect Commerzbank’s corporate responsibility demands of its service providers and suppliers. Therefore, Commerzbank also actively influences the sustainable orientation of suppliers and service providers through purchasing decisions. The regulations defined by Corporate Procurement are binding for all units of Commerzbank AG both in Germany and abroad. The target group includes all process participants involved in procurement. The standard serves as a framework for subsidiar- ies in Germany and abroad when making internal decisions based on company-specific requirements. The standard for sustainable procurement promotes sustain- able development in the procurement process. The defined crite- ria and rules of conduct are intended to make the consideration of sustainability aspects practicable for all process partici- pants. In addition, the standard aims to raise awareness among Commerzbank employees on the topic of sustainability. Within the context of the internal control system, controls have been defined for evaluating suppliers prior to entering into new contractual relationships as well as for managing existing suppli- ers. These also include ESG criteria as a part of an overall scoring model. When selecting suppliers, Commerzbank’s Reputational Risk Management analyses the suppliers on a case-by-case basis. The commissioning organisational units and Corporate Procure- ment evaluate service providers to ensure compliance with the requirements outlined in the standard. We notify suppliers of any necessary improvements in terms of sustainability performance and document the results of the assessments. Banking business Commerzbank AG’s climate change mitigation targets in the cus- tomer business and the steps required to achieve these objectives are explicitly governed by the ESG framework and the associated internal “ESG Framework Policy”. In this policy and the underly- ing procedures, Commerzbank AG sets out the building blocks of its sustainability strategy and describes how the three sustaina- bility KPIs are managed:  Net zero carbon emissions in the loan and investment portfo- lio by 2050  Mobilising €300bn in sustainable products by 2025  Net zero carbon emissions in banking operations by 2040 One concrete goal is therefore to create transparency in our sustainability activities, including a clear definition of what ESG means in our customer business. The framework also presents our sustainable product solutions and consolidates the sustaina- bility guidelines and exclusion criteria. Commerzbank published a revised framework in February 2025, which has been updated to include an expanded and optimised set of sustainability targets and has undergone a fundamental redesign in terms of structure. Climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation are addressed in the ESG framework and in the corresponding policy, primarily through the net zero target, SBTi management, binding exclusion criteria and minimum standards, consideration of cli- mate matters in risk management, as well as by financing sus- tainable projects and offering sustainable products. The topic of renewable energies is addressed through financing for projects in this area, for example through the Centre of Competence Green Infrastructure Finance. The main objective of the framework and internal policy is to create a Bank-wide standard that enables stringent management of the relevant products, processes and activities, paving the way for the sustainable transformation of Commerzbank AG. The ESG framework therefore describes both Commerzbank’s impacts on the environment (“Save the World” perspective) and the environ- ment’s impacts on Commerzbank AG (“Save the Bank” perspec- tive), encompassing both the risk and impact perspectives of the associated business activities. Significant opportunities arise in the sustainability context from sustainable product solutions (fi- nancing and investments), which are covered by the €300bn tar- get. Commerzbank AG’s sustainability efforts as described in the framework are operationalised and monitored using the three sustainability KPIs. The Group Sustainability Board, a Bank-wide committee focusing on sustainability issues that is attended by members of the Board of Managing Directors, is responsible for the ESG framework. The head of Group Strategy, Transformation & Sustainability division and the steering committee of the stra- tegic initiative “Sustainability 360°” are responsible for the inter- nal policy."

The work of the Board of Managing Directors is specified in greater detail in its rules of procedure, which may be viewed on Commerzbank AG’s website. The remuneration of the members of the Board of Managing Directors is presented in detail in the remuneration report, which is published on Commerzbank AG’s website. Supervisory Board Commerzbank AG’s Supervisory Board advises and monitors the Board of Managing Directors in its management of the Bank and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance. The Supervisory Board discharges its responsibilities in accordance with legal requirements, the Articles of Association and its rules of procedure. It cooperates closely and on a basis of trust with the Board of Managing Directors in the interests of the Bank. Taking into account the recommendations of the Presiding and Nomination Committee, the Supervisory Board decides on the appointment and dismissal of members of the Board of Managing Directors and, together with the Board of Managing Directors, ensures long-term succession planning. If necessary, external consultants are brought in. The composition of the Supervisory Board and the members of its committees are presented on pages 19 to 21 of this Annual Report, in accordance with recommendation D.2 of the German Corporate Governance Code. Details of the work of this body, its structure and its control function can be found in the report of the Supervisory Board on pages 6 to 18. Further details on how the Supervisory Board and its committees work can be found in the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board, available on Commerzbank AG’s website. The duties of the individual permanent committees are set out in the respective rules of procedure, which can also be viewed on Commerzbank AG’s website. According to recommendation C.1 of the Code, the Supervisory Board should set concrete objectives and draw up a profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. In doing so, it should give consideration to diversity. The Supervisory Board’s skills and expertise profile shall also comprise expertise regarding sustainability issues relevant to the Bank. Appointments proposed by the Supervisory Board to the Annual General Meeting should take these objectives into account while also seeking to fulfil the profile of skills and expertise for the board as a whole. The status of implementation is to be disclosed in the form of a qualification matrix in the declaration on corporate governance. In addition, in accordance with recommendation C.2 of the Code, an age limit for members of the Supervisory Board should be specified and disclosed in the declaration on corporate governance. The length of Supervisory Board membership is also to be disclosed in accordance with recommendation C.3 of the Code. Commerzbank AG’s Supervisory Board has approved the following concrete objectives: The composition of the Supervisory Board should be such that, overall, its members have the necessary skills, expertise, experience and knowledge to be able to perform its duties properly. In particular, the Supervisory Board should have all the expertise and experience deemed essential for the activities of the Commerzbank Group. In addition, the legal requirements with regard to special expertise and professional experience of individual members of the Supervisory Board in specific areas must be met (for example, expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing, including sustainability reporting and auditing thereof, as well as in the areas of risk management and risk controlling), and at least one member of the Supervisory Board should have special expertise in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues. The members of the Supervisory Board must be able to challenge and monitor the decisions made by the Board of Managing Directors. The members of the Supervisory Board should also be able to devote sufficient time to the performance of their duties. Members should be reliable, and consideration should be given to their commitment, personality, professionalism, integrity and independence. The target is that the Supervisory Board should always have at least eight members elected by the Annual General Meeting who are independent as defined in recommendation C.6 of the Code, and not more than two former members of Commerzbank AG’s Board of Managing Directors. The length of service of the Supervisory Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting should generally not exceed a period of 12 years. The term of office of a member of the Supervisory Board should generally end at the end of the Annual General Meeting following the member’s 72nd birthday. The Supervisory Board has resolved a detailed profile of skills and expertise for its composition, which may be consulted on Commerzbank AG’s website. As can be seen from the following qualification matrix based on a self-assessment by members of the Supervisory Board, all objectives set by the Supervisory Board with regard to its composition, as well as its profile of skills and expertise, had been implemented as of 31 December 2024:"

"110 Commerzbank Annual Report 2024 [E1-7] GHG removals and GHG mitigation projects financed through carbon credits GHG removal and storage Climate change mitigation is an important aspect of our corporate responsibility. We continuously strive to further reduce our ecolog- ical footprint. We follow the principle of “Avoid and reduce before offsetting”. We offset unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions from our banking operations as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from Commerzbank AG by purchasing and cancelling high-quality car- bon credits. In the current reporting period, we offset a total of 96,934 tones of CO2eq through the purchase and cancellation of carbon credits outside the value chain. Of this, 25% is accounted for by the “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project in Pakistan, which uses nature-based methods to reduce carbon emissions through mangrove reforesta- tion. The remaining 75% comes from projects to avoid carbon emissions, including the “Nouakchott 30 MW Wind Power Plant” (wind energy in Mauritania) and the “CTL Landfill Gas Project” (biogas in Brazil). All projects mentioned meet the recognised qual- ity standards of the Verra Verified Carbon Standard or the Gold Standard. The “Delta Blue Carbon – 1” project can also provide so- called Corresponding Adjustments. Detailed information on the individual projects can be found on our homepage on carbon off- setting for banking operations. Offsetting is based on our annually recorded and externally ver- ified Commerzbank AG greenhouse gas emissions. In the 2024 re- porting year we offset both current emissions and parts of emissions from 2023. Offsetting strategy All projects meet the highest quality standards. The integrity of emission reduction projects and the carbon credits generated from them is crucial to achieve effective carbon offsetting. We therefore act according to our principles for compensating unavoidable car- bon emissions when selecting projects. These principles relate to the quality of the credits, the technologies used and the countries where the projects are located. Offsetting is implemented exclu- sively through projects with generally recognised quality standards such as the Verra Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard or Plan Vivo. When selecting projects, we also follow the Core Carbon Prin- ciples (CCP) framework, which outlines a comprehensive approach to ensuring quality and integrity in the voluntary carbon market. The focus of the projects we select is on countries in the global South, as these are often the ones most affected by the conse- quences of climate change. We do not remove or store any greenhouse gases in our own operations or in the upstream and downstream value chain.

We have developed a wide range of activities, measures and objectives for this purpose, which we describe in de- tail in ESRS E4-2 to E4-6. At the present time, however, Com- merzbank does not have a comprehensive transition plan on this topic, since this was identified as immaterial for us during the ma- teriality assessment. In addition, the methodological basis and data availability needed to draw up such a transition plan currently fall short of requirements. Commerzbank is actively working to solve these challenges. Further information can be found in ESRS E4-2 to E4-6. Biodiversity risks, like climate risks, are regularly included in the business and sustainability strategy. As part of its annual strategy process, Commerzbank analyses various key indicators and envi- ronmental factors that are relevant to the Bank’s strategy and busi- ness model. This analysis includes both internal perspectives (including employees) and external perspectives (including custom- ers and investors). The results and conclusions from the holistic analysis are used in the downstream strategy process to develop the strategy and business model. Commerzbank also conducts an annual assessment of the mate- riality of biodiversity risks, including their impact on business risks. The results of this analysis are used to help develop the business strategy, the business risk strategy and the various sub-risk strate- gies. For further information on how we incorporate biodiversity into our strategy and business model, please see ESRS E4 SBM-3. [E4-2] Policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems Almost all global economic activities depend on biodiversity and ecosystem services. A look at the current state of biodiversity makes it clear that the time for action is now. Dependency and impacts on biodiversity can lead to physical and transition risks – but they can also create opportunities. For this rea- son, the topic of biodiversity is also of strategic importance for Com- merzbank AG. Concepts in Commerzbank’s banking business Commerzbank AG has already adopted specific positions and exclu- sion criteria geared to protecting biodiversity and ecosystems. Im- portant aspects include land use change, pollution and the use of water and marine resources. A major problem concerning land use change is deforestation. To minimise deforestation risks in Commerzbank AG’s portfolio, we have formulated our own position on the topic of deforestation. For more information on this strategy, see ESRS E4-3 and E4-4. Furthermore, in its position on mining, Commerzbank AG ex- cludes the financing of mining projects that use mountain top re- moval (MTR) due to the damage this does to the surrounding area, as well as the financing of companies that mine coal using this method. This mining technique is extremely harmful to the environ- ment and results in significant land use changes. Ecological factors as well as reports of adverse impacts on high conservation value areas and UNESCO World Heritage Sites, for ex- ample in the energy and fossil fuel sectors, are also included in a case-by-case assessment. Taking these factors into account should help to preserve important ecological and cultural regions and mit- igate changes in these areas."
