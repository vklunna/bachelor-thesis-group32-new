"Material impacts and risks IRO IRO Attraction and retention of talent and work-life balance Our ability to attract and retain a workforce with the necessary skills and experience is fundamental to our success and relates to other identified impacts, including work-life balance. In a competitive labour market, as well as under potential reputational pressures, difficulties in attracting or retaining employees could negatively impact our performance and strategic objectives. The identified risk arises from the dependencies on our own workforce, particularly those working in locations and function where there is a high demand within pharmaceu- tical research, development, manufacturing and commercial. The risk has been identified through our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process. The vaccine sector can be subject to fluctuating market demands, due to external factors such as urgent responses to disease outbreaks. As an employer, we are responsible for shaping working conditions and work-life balance for our employees, impacting their overall well-being and job satisfac- tion, which ultimately affects our ability to retain talent. Peak periods can affect people working in various departments and sites throughout the organization, as they could lead to additional work- load. Policies & processes Remote working policy Our remote working policy defines the governing framework for employees performing working hours outside the organization's premises. The policy applies universally to all employees and is intended to enhance operational efficiency, employee engagement and organizational alignment through structured and flexible working arrangement. The policy reflects our commitment to flexible workplace practices, prioritizing well-being and adaptability to modern work requirements. The New Ways of Working initiative With the aim to increase flexibility and enhance work-life balance, we introduced our New Ways of Working initiative in 2021. Through this, we actively encourage employees to work collaboratively and adopt flexible working arrangements. By fostering a culture of flexibility, and improved work spaces at our offices, we provide a framework for work practices, which support employees in achieving improved work-life balance, also in peak periods. Actions In 2024, we initiated a series of initiatives aimed at strengthening our ability to attract and retain talent, with efforts focused on the below key actions: Leadership development LeadPioneers is our Leadership development program that provides a structured approach to leadership, setting clear expectations and fostering a shared understanding of effective leadership practices. Through this program, we equip leaders with the skills they need to lead their people and organization in line with present and future demands. LeadPioneers offers two distinct learning tracks: Leading Others, tailored for leaders managing individual contributors, and Leading Leaders designed to educate leaders of other managers. Managed by the HR Development Team, LeadPio- neers trains leaders in cohorts throughout 2025, with an objective for all leaders with at least three direct reports to complete the program by third quarter of 2026. Expected outcomes include consistently enhancing leadership capabilities, establishing a culture prioritizing accountability, and a resilient leadership framework aligned with our strategic objectives. Performance management system Our Performance Management system is a manage- ment tool to align expectations between employees and managers. It facilitates collaboration, dialogue, and follow-up on individual performance and devel- opment goals. By supporting continuous engagement and alignment on deliverables and development plans, it contributes to achieving long-term organi- zational objectives. Integrated into annual HR processes, the perfor- mance management system ensures ongoing value through structured discussions and actionable outcomes. Expected benefits include improved performance tracking, focused development efforts, and enhanced alignment with organizational prior- ities. Targets Our people are the key to our success and although we have not formalized targets, we continuously monitor our performance in relation to talent attraction and retention, including work-life balance. This is done through various processes, including tracking turnover rates, employee engagement surveys, performance and development talks, lead- ership development program, one-on-one dialogue with managers, and exit-interviews.

"IRO Equal treatment and opportunities for all Given our global presence and reliance on a highly skilled workforce, we may risk our ability to attract and retain talent if we do not keep momentum in current efforts and continuously develop initiatives to ensure that we maintain an inclusive and diverse workforce. This risk is linked to our dependency on human resources and our ability to attract and retain talent, including risk considerations related to our reputation, legal sanctions, and/or labour disputes. Policies Diversity and inclusion policy Our Diversity and inclusion policy outlines our approach to ensuring equal treatment and oppor- tunities for all employees, which is a key compo- nent of our sustainability efforts. The policy aims to create a work environment where everyone feels respected and valued in support of a diverse workplace. The policy covers the following grounds for discrimination, but not limited to: gender, age, educational background, ethnicity, physical impair- ment, religion, or sexual orientation. The policy addresses material impacts such as elim- inating biases in selection and promotion processes and preventing discriminatory behavior. Executive Management is accountable for the imple- mentation of the diversity and inclusion policy. Global policy on sexual harassment and global policy on bullying and harassment at work We do not accept any kinds of bullying and harass- ment. Our policies stress the importance of respect and dignity while providing guidance on preventing and remediating inappropriate behaviors. Addition- ally, they emphasize the collective for cultivating a workplace where every individual feels safe, valued, and empowered to contribute fully. Maintaining a respectful workplace is a shared responsibility. All employees, including manage- ment, are accountable for adhering to the principles outlined in the policies. Members of the Executive Management are the most senior level account- able for the implementation of these policies. The policies are accessible for all employees via our intranet. We do not currently have specific policy commit- ments related to positive action for people from groups at particular risk of vulnerability Processes for remediation We are committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive, and respectful workplace where all employees are treated with dignity. We encourage employees to address concerns at the local level whenever possible. Employees who experience or witness inappropriate behavior should first attempt to resolve the issue by speaking with the individuals involved, their immediate manager, or a trusted colleague. If further support is needed, employees are urged to contact their HR Business Partner, who will facilitate resolution in line with company guidelines. In cases where local resolution is not possible, or if the concern involves a direct manager, employees may escalate the issue to a higher-level manager, a union or Workers Council representative or the Health and Safety Representative. We uphold a strict non-retaliation policy to protect employees who report concerns in good faith and continuously review our processes to ensure they remain effective, accessible, and aligned with regu- latory and ethical standards. Actions In 2024, we conducted two online programs as part of our ongoing commitment to educate employees on the importance of inclusion and unconscious bias. The sessions were focused on two key topics. 1. Inclusive Colleagueship - emphasizing the importance of inclusion, belonging, and allyship through practical, everyday actions; and 2. Unconscious Bias - exploring the impact of unconscious bias and impact on the workplace, providing strategies to mitigate bias. The sessions offered actionable insights on how employees contribute to an inclusive work environ- ment, emphasizing personal and collective respon- sibility in fostering an inclusive work environment. Targets Our people are the key to our success and although we have not formalized targets, we continuously monitor our performance in relation to equal opportunities and treatment. This is done through awareness trainings, salary benchmarks checks, and employee engagement surveys.

"IRO Health and safety We have processes in our manufacturing and research facilities that could pose a risk of nega- tive impact on a person’s physical health. This also applies to non-employees carrying out activities and services on our behalf. The negative impacts relate to individual incidents only for the part of our workforce that work in the context of our vaccines research and manufacturing. As this is an inherent part of our business model (end-to-end develop- ment and manufacturing of vaccines) decreasing the risk of negative impacts related to health and safety remains a priority on all our manufacturing and research facilities. The potential impacts described inform daily and strategic decision-making. Policies Global Environmental, Health & Safety Policy Our Global Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Policy covers all our business areas and locations. The policy emphasizes high standards of EHS performance, ensuring compliance with applicable EHS laws, managing EHS risks, and continuously seeking opportunities to reduce risks and improve performance. It highlights the importance of educating and enabling employees and key stakeholders inter- nally and externally to work safely and responsibly, fostering positive interactions and work practices through open dialogue on EHS matters. The EHS Management System, overseen by governance arrangements involving all company levels, ensures that performance is monitored and regularly reviewed to meet high standards and provide value to stakeholders. Site heads are responsible for implementing the policy and ensuring that it is effective. The content was revised during 2024, and the updated policy was published in the beginning of 2025. Employee vaccination program The policy aims to ensure health and safety of employees operating in environments with poten- tial exposure to infectious agents. It establishes protocols for vaccination for employees working in high-risk environments with live viruses. Objectives include protecting employees from health risks associated with exposure to infectious agents, implementing stringent access control to high-risk areas, aligning with global health and biosafety standards, thereby minimizing potential adverse impacts on physical health. The policy applies to all employees engaged in activities involving potential exposure to virus, including employees in production, quality control, environmental monitoring, and support roles operating in designated high-risk areas. The policy primarily addresses operations within our facilities, specifically activities directly involving the handling or production of hazardous biological materials. Engaging with our workforce We prioritize the health and safety of our employees through structured engagement processes with our workforce and their representatives. Our EHS Committee operates at the strategic level, collab- orating closely with Site Heads and the ESG repre- sentatives to plan, lead, and coordinate our efforts in protecting employee health and safety, the surrounding environment, and risk prevention. This committee ensures that strategic decisions align with our commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace. Engagement with our workforce occurs directly and through workers' representatives. This engage- ment is integral to our decision-making processes, ensuring that the perspectives of our workforce are incorporated into managing actual and potential impacts. Engagement occurs at multiple stages, including planning, implementation, and review phases of health and safety initiatives. The types of engagement include regular meetings, surveys, and feedback sessions, conducted frequently to ensure continuous dialogue and improvement. The Global EHS Director holds the overall respon- sibility for setting the strategic direction for EHS, aligning with each global function, while ensuring workforce engagement and feedback is the core of the strategy. The site heads have the overall responsibility, which is a legal requirement in most countries. Our Global EHS Operations team has been estab- lished at the operational level, working in collabo- ration with EHS Management to handle and partici- pate in risk prevention activities. These groups play a role in addressing unsustainable EHS matters, either by resolving them directly or escalating them to the EHS Committee. The EHS Committee act as a liaison between employees and the work environ- ment organization, ensuring effective communica- tion and collaboration. They are also responsible for providing comprehensive training and instruction to all employees, ensuring that everyone is well-in- formed about safety protocols and best practices. Where relevant, we incorporate specific considera- tions to vulnerable employees, including pregnant women. We have an internal policy that outlines specific tasks pregnant women should avoid to prevent any risk to their health and safety. This policy helps protect both the expectant mother and her unborn child by minimizing workplace hazards. The policy stipulates that specific individual risk assessments must be carried out for each pregnant worker. Where a potential risk is identified and cannot be eliminated, we will find alternative work arrangement, which will not impact the expectant or breastfeeding mother or unborn child.
