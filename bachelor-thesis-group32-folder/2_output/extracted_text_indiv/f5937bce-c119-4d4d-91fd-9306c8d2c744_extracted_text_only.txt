"Environmental management Our commitment is outlined in our Business Conduct Policy and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Policy, which defines minimum requirements for all Danfoss locations. Our environmental management approach is based on international best practices in line with our sustainability agenda. Furthermore, we require that all Danfoss production sites implement and maintain management systems for the environment, health, and safety, compliant with requirements in ISO 14001. In 2024, 76% of our production sites maintained an ISO 14001 certification. Read more about our approach, policies, and reports here Water management Danfoss’ own operations are not water-intensive, and water is primarily used in our production for process cooling. Our global factory footprint spans across all regions of the world, except Africa. Based on a mapping conducted using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we have identified that 11 of our factories are located in regions facing water scarcity and quality issues, which corresponds to 16.6% of Danfoss’ total water withdrawals. Where we operate, our water management is aligned with local legislation, including minimizing the use of harmful chemicals in water treatments and ensuring that processed water is treated before discharge. In 2024, we issued a new internal global water management standard that outlines our commitment to water conservation, water quality management, and responsible water usage in our operations. We aim to continuously reduce our water use with a special focus on sites located in areas with water scarcity. Accountability for this standard lies with our Chief Sustainability Officer. We have initiated additional analysis of our water usage in own operations and upstream value chain to determine the materiality of the Water and Marine Resources Standard (ESRS E3). At Danfoss, we are committed to safeguarding the environment. We take action to reduce our environmental impacts and identify opportunities to become more sustainable. Prevention of pollution Our commitment to prevent pollution of air, water, and soil are set out in our various policies, which apply to the whole of Danfoss, as we acknowledge that preventing pollution requires a holistic approach. These standards and policies define our commitments to protect the environment by preventing pollution by managing and utilizing resources effectively and efficiently. This is necessary to limit our impact on the environment and communities within our own operations and through the products and solutions that we bring to market. Danfoss complies with local requirements at site and legal-entity level, and we also monitor non-GHG air emissions at our sites. In case of potential pollution incidents, we have procedures in place to remediate impacts. We have initiated additional analysis of our global impact to determine the materiality of the Pollution Standard (ESRS E2). Protecting biodiversity and ecosystems During 2024, we have mapped our sites for proximity to biodiversity-sensitive areas. Through this assess- ment, we were able to conclude that Danfoss sites are not located in biodiversity-sensitive areas, but 15 sites were found to be near such areas. Danfoss requires all these areas to maintain management systems for the environment, compliant with requirements in the ISO 14001 standard, which also covers biodiversity-related impacts such as flooding and water stress. In 2025, we will continue to identify and assess our nature-related issues, as guided by the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This approach supports our efforts to assess biodiversity- related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across our value chain. We will also look further into the topic of biodiversity in collaboration with our supply chain partners and customers. 78 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"
"High-performing, diverse teams Our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. We expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. In 2024, Danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. We have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. This means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all Danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. Responsibility for our people strategy lies with our Executive Vice President, Group Human Resources. We know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. We have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. Focus areas in 2024 We continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. A key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining Danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many Danfoss colleagues. Our five global ERG themes cover Abilities — Gender, Generations, Multicultural and Nations, and Pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. Activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in STEM, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. Danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. We have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our President & CEO. The programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. Talent development Developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of Danfoss. By providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. Along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. Focus areas in 2024 People development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. We apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. We have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. Additionally, we have We firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. We strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. We have succession plans in place for all critical roles at Danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. To support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like INSEAD. To support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. In 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our INSEAD program. The Executive Transitions Program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. Members of the Group Execu- tive Team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. In 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. Our Global Mentoring Program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. In 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. We also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"The Danfoss Postgraduate Program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. In 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. Striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. Equal pay for work of equal value Equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. The basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such Danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. Our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. To prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. This is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. The total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. During the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. During the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. The gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). Our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. To prepare for the EU Pay Transparency Directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on EU countries as a starting point. Following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the EU countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. In 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. To ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and HR professionals who execute pay decisions together. Living wage At Danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. We are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. This means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. In 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all Danfoss employees receive a living wage. To date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story To enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want Danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. In 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. Psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. It creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation. In conclusion, a safe environment forms the foundation for addressing biases and fostering a growth mindset, thus leading to better performance. Engaging with our people To ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including HR- and IT-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ERGs. Focus areas in 2024 Our four Danfoss AskHR hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. We encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. Regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. To promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. Our global engagement survey, the Voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. It is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. The survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at Danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. All teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. Our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. Additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. Our work councils are organized at the local, national, and European level. The Danfoss European Works Council (DEWC) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. The DEWC consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. Meeting minutes are published on our intranet. In 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-EU countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. A few examples come from the US, where Danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and Latin America and China, where Danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities.

"6 5 4 1 2 3 Human and labor rights Since our founding in 1933, Danfoss has embraced a strong sense of social responsibility, long before terms like ESG and CSR were widely recognized. Supporting our people and their families, as well as local communities, has been a fundamental part of who we are, shaping the way we operate and grow. At Danfoss, we are deeply committed to fulfilling our responsibilities to respect human rights across our value chain. Our commitments and approach to upholding human and labor rights are grounded in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, the International Bill of Human Rights, and the ILO Core Conventions on Labor Standards. These principles are outlined in our Human Rights Policy, which is approved by our CEO, and further anchored in the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct and our Danfoss Ethics Handbook. The Danfoss Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of ethics and compliance, which includes human and labor rights, and our Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of our compliance programs. Our commitments are further implemented through the day-to-day operations of key functions such as procurement, human resources, risk and compliance, as well as sustainability. We furthermore expect all employees and managers to respect human and labor rights in their day-to-day activities, as set out in the Danfoss Ethics Handbook. Human rights due diligence Our human rights due diligence process is based on a regional, risk-based approach to assess human rights issues in the regions in which we operate. Our approach enables us to identify and address adverse impacts and human rights risks and to implement mitigation and prevention measures. To ensure our approach and processes are effective, we regularly monitor and evaluate the outcome of our activities and due diligence efforts. To gain further insight into the perspectives of vulnerable and marginalized stakeholders, we also actively engage and participate in the Nordic Business Network for Human Rights, coordinated by the Danish Institute for Human Rights. As a global company, human and labor rights have always been a priority. At Danfoss, we believe that human rights are about respecting and protecting the dignity of all people. Access to remedy The Danfoss Ethics Hotline serves as our grievance mechanism. It is hosted by an external operator, ensuring that own employees as well as external stakeholders can anonymously report violation of legislation, human rights, or internal ethics guidelines without risk of retaliation. Communicate On an annual basis, we communicate our policies, outcomes, and performance through e.g., our Modern Slavery Act Statement or the Norwegian Transparency Acts Statement. Track implementation and results We monitor and follow-up on defined actions to ensure progress in our risk prevention and mitigation activities. Policy We recognize our responsibility to respect human rights in our own operations and throughout our value chain. Our work with human rights is guided by our Human Rights Policy, Danfoss Ethics Handbook, Modern Slavery Act Statement and further anchored in the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct. Our approach is based on the UN Global Compact and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Identify and assess As part of our due diligence process, we identify and assess risks and adverse impacts in the areas we operate. Our salient human rights and reports received in our human rights grievance mechanism are important elements when it comes to the identification and assessment of adverse impacts. Cease, prevent, or mitigate We take a global approach to risk prevention. In the event of adverse impacts, we cease or mitigate based on action plans defined on a case-by-case basis. 87 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"The Whistleblower function — including the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which is publicly available — plays an important role in helping us identify and understand where and how human rights impacts may be taking place in our value chain. If we find that Danfoss has caused or contributed to actual negative impacts on human rights, we will ensure that we meet our responsibilities according to the UNGPs. This means that we will ensure that remediation actions are taken and remedy is provided for impacted people. The actions we take are determined on a case-by-case basis and depend on whether our role as a business is directly linked or contributed to the negative impact. Through our human rights due diligence process, we have identified salient human rights issues. These are human rights that are at the greatest risk of severe negative impact. To address these risks and potential adverse impacts, we work proactively to mitigate and prevent human rights-related risks in our value chain. As part of our due diligence process, we monitor our activities to ensure progress in our risk prevention and risk mitigation. Regular follow-up ensures that progress is monitored and countries with the highest risk of negative impacts are prioritized. For example, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, all our factories are covered by our 'Safety First' program and have actions in place to prevent excessive working hours during peak seasons. We actively work to raise awareness on topics such as discrimination and have processes established to prevent discrimination in the workplace. Our responsibility to respect human rights extends across our value chain as defined by the UN Guiding Principles. In previous years, we conducted an assessment to identify our salient human rights issues. One of the key issues identified relates to modern slavery, including forced labor, child labor, prison labor, and human trafficking. Our requirements for our employees and suppliers are clearly defined in our Danfoss Ethics Handbook and our Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct, and they are integrated into our supplier onboarding and monitoring mechanisms. Additional information on how we work to address and mitigate modern slavery risks is found in the Danfoss Modern Slavery Act Statement which is available here Key actions in 2024 In 2024, we continued to assess and strengthen our due diligence processes in pursuance of existing and incoming regulation on sustainability due diligence. We also conducted an internal mapping against the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to gain a better understanding of potential areas for improvement. Furthermore, we strengthened our due diligence regarding potential military end-use of our products. During the year, we also updated our Human Rights Policy to reflect our commitment on human rights due diligence. Going forward, in 2025 we will focus on actions that aim to increase transparency of our value chain and strengthen our risk assessment and due diligence processes. Responsible mineral sourcing and conflict minerals Minerals such as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold that originate from conflicted or high-risk areas are known as conflict minerals as these are used to finance armed conflicts and human rights abuses. Danfoss supports the efforts of governments and organizations to end human rights abuses and violations in conflict areas. Danfoss is therefore committed to sourcing materials and components from companies that also share our values regarding human rights, ethics, and environmental responsibility. To support the Responsible Minerals Initiative and to enable responsible sourcing decision-making, we review whether the tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold in our products originate from conflict-affected or high-risk regions. As part of this work, we engage with our suppliers on an ongoing basis through, for example, our recurring campaigns to acquire supplier information on conflict minerals, including smelter/ refiner identification and country of origin. Through our supplier engagement approach, we are able to reach 1,500 tier one suppliers on an annual basis to address this topic. This has enabled us to provide conflict minerals reporting templates (CMRT) to our customers and initiate relevant due diligence activities to mitigate high risk smelters in our supply chain.

Our aim is to provide an inspiring and inclusive work environment where people feel that they belong. Our people activities support us in attracting and retaining the best talent. With the best people, we get the best performance. The representation of women on the Board of Directors is currently 25%. Women in leadership positions is a key metric for improving gender balance in the organization and increased in 2024 to 23.7% (2023: 22.1%), the highest increase ever in the share of women in leadership roles at Danfoss. Improving the gender and nationality diversity of our global leadership teams is also one of our key focus areas. After achieving a very strong increase of 8.1%-points in Management Team Diversity from 2022 to 2023, we saw a decrease of 2.4%-points to 73.1% in 2024. However, we are still on track to meet our target of 80% for 2030. Furthermore, Danfoss is committed to maintaining a gender pay gap below 5%. In 2024, the total pay ratio globally between genders per job category decreased to 6.3% (2023: 6.9%). During 2025, we will intensify our work to minimize this gap. Safety is a priority for Danfoss, and we do not tolerate unsafe behavior and environments. We continue to address and promote health and safety internally through clear policies, continuous safety training, dialogues, and workshops as well as strong leadership role-modeling. As we expand our business, we stay committed to ensuring a healthy and safe working environment. Since 2017, we have almost doubled the size of Danfoss. In 2024, the Lost Time Injury Frequency rate (LTIF) has increased slightly from a record low 1.2 in 2023 to 1.3 in 2024. Also, our Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIF) increased slightly from 2.1 in 2023 to 2.3 in 2024. We expect to get back to 2023 levels during 2025.

"The Danfoss Postgraduate Program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. In 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. Striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. Equal pay for work of equal value Equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. The basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such Danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. Our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. To prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. This is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. The total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. During the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. During the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. The gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). Our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. To prepare for the EU Pay Transparency Directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on EU countries as a starting point. Following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the EU countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. In 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. To ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and HR professionals who execute pay decisions together. Living wage At Danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. We are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. This means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. In 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all Danfoss employees receive a living wage. To date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Social People Number of employees The number of employees is measured by headcount at the end of year, including employees on leave. Employee turnover Employee turnover is reported as the percentage of employees who left Danfoss, including voluntary exits, involuntary exits, and retirements, divided by the average headcount over a 12-month period. Employee engagement score The global Voice employee engagement survey has been performed every 2 year since 2007. The survey is run by an external provider, who ensures that all data and results remain anonymous and treated confidentially. Gender split, all employees The split between genders for the total workforce is measured by headcount and reported as the percentage of women, men, and other employees. Employees can voluntarily self-identify their gender in the HR system. Gender split, all leadership positions The split between genders in all leadership positions is measured by headcount and reported as the percentage of women, men, and other employees in leadership positions. Leaders are defined as having a team reporting directly to them. Gender split, top management level The split between genders in top management level 1-4. Management team diversity Management team diversity is measured on manager levels 1-4. Teams of at least five employees (excluding administrative assistants) are diverse if they are composed of at least two genders and two nationalities. The team is considered non-diverse if only one of these requirements is met. Pay ratio between gender and job categories The pay ratio between genders is reported both as the general pay ratio between men and women employees and as the pay ratio within job categories (equal pay for equal work). The general pay ratio between genders is determined as the average salary for men compared to the average salary for women. Pay ratio within job categories shows the average pay ratio between employees in the same job categories. Data from Hydro-Gear is not included in this pay ration calculation. Pay ratio between CEO and average employee The pay ratio between the salary of the CEO compared to average employee salary (excluding CEO salary) includes bonuses and benefits.

"Targets Progress Circularity As raw materials become increasingly scarce and more costly to extract, keeping resources in circulation is crucial. Where resources are kept in circulation, waste and pollution are reduced. At Danfoss, our circularity ambition addresses our existing product portfolio and our new product development. Improvements to the existing port folio are achieved with after-sales services and new business opportunities such as take-back, remanufacturing, and refurbishment, which all contribute to the circular economy. Design of new products that contribute to the circular economy entails using fewer or more circular raw materials, applying low-carbon production processes, and designing for reuse, repair, and recycling. At Danfoss, we engineer products and solutions that enable us and our customers to do more with less. We invest in circularity to be responsible for our own environmental impact and to maintain, and improve, our competitiveness. To engineer the products for tomorrow, circularity must be an integrated part of the innovation cycle from the beginning. As of 2023, we have mapped and monitor our circular business revenue streams which are revenues from: • refurbished/remanufactured products, systems, or elements resold • repair and maintenance activities to prolong the lifetime of our products, upgrade activities • the sale of spare parts • performance and access-based models (e.g., sharing or leasing products and services) • digital services aiming to prolong the products’ lifetime In 2024, our circular business revenues increased by 5%. of all new product developments initiated in 2024 were covered by Danfoss’ circularity approach. increase in 2024, equal to EUR 19m, compared to 2023 baseline. 80% 25% of newly developed products launched to be covered by Danfoss’ circularity approach by 2030. 25% 5% increase in circular business revenues by 2030 compared to our 2023 baseline, equal to EUR 361m. 73 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"
"Safety First! To meet our commitments, we have established global policies where accountability for health and safety lies with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) leadership. Our EHS Policy and other internal policies are the backbone of how we ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. EHS requirements that apply to external parties, such as contractors working at Danfoss sites, are defined in our contractor safety guidelines. Having an effective prevention and risk-based approach while driving continuous improvements, are the fundamental principles of our approach. To maintain a robust management system, and align with best practices, we require that all our production sites comply with international standards such as ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management systems, and ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Additionally, we comply with local statutory requirements, and all our employees are covered by our EHS management system. Our Health and Well-being Policy promotes well- being, advises on physical and mental health issues, and addresses medical incidents. At Danfoss, we acknowledge the link between employee well-being and a work environment free from harassment and discrimination1. Accountability for well-being in Danfoss lies with our leaders. To achieve our commitment, we have monitoring mechanisms in place, conduct audits, and implement preventive actions accordingly. Our key focus areas and actions taken include • Regular health and safety training for all employees. • Recurring risk assessments of machinery, materials, chemicals and workflows. • Preventive maintenance of machinery to avoid breakdowns and accidents. • An incident alert mechanism ensuring that corrective actions are addressed globally. • Global reporting of potential hazards and implementation of measures to mitigate and/or eliminate risks before such occur. We provide a range of support systems. For example, we have personnel at our sites who are trained in first aid. Furthermore, as part of our benefits program, our employees are covered by health insurance and an employee assistance program (EAP) that offers professional counselling for any work or personal issue and an online resource hub. At Danfoss, we prioritize and protect the physical and psychological safety and health of all employees, and we are committed to creating a safe work environment. We believe it is fundamental that we have an effective health and safety management system in place to sustain a culture that prioritizes safety and well-being. 1 We do not tolerate discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, cast, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, disability, whether physical, mental, or learning, or any other characteristics protected by laws. 2 LTIF adjusted for newly acquired SEMIKRON and BOCK® Compressors is 1.1 and TRIF 2.1. Targets 2024 reflects the inclusion of both. We measure the effectiveness of our actions through our Health and Safety KPIs: LTIF (Lost Time Incidents Frequency) and TRIF (Total Recordable Incidents Frequency). Health & Safety 2023 20242 Target LTIF 1.2 1.3 1.4 TRIF 2.1 2.3 2.4 Fatalities 0 0 - Mental health We believe that promoting mental health in the workplace is crucial as it enhances employee well- being, productivity, and overall organizational success. In 2024, our actions included increasing awareness about mental health, and we introduced a stress management e-learning training for all leaders. The e-learning was piloted in Denmark and will be made available globally in 2025. While recognizing the need for global consistency, Danfoss employees are empowered to implement local initiatives, e.g., through employee resource groups (ERGs) or business segment-, country-, or site-level initiatives. To promote a workplace where everyone feels safe to speak up, share new ideas, and express themselves freely, we have launched a series of psychological safety events. The goal has been to cultivate a common understanding and provide actionable tactics for nurturing psychological safety and ensure that all voices are heard and can contribute to our joint success. 81 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"

"To protect against retaliation, the Danfoss Ethics Hotline enables case reporters to maintain their anonymity by offering a secure and unique mailbox. This allows the case investigator to maintain contact with the case reporter and provide case updates to the reporting party. To ensure that reports are investigated independently and impartially, case investigators are separate from the chain of management involved in the identified matters. When a case is reported, the central Ethics Hotline function generally handles all case investigations, involving trusted local or global experts as needed unless local legislation requires case handling by local management teams. All cases are overseen by the Ethics Committee to ensure the consistent and ethical handling of cases throughout the organization. To promote the use of the Ethics Hotline, the Danfoss Ethics Handbook provides guidance on how to report concerns through the Danfoss Ethics Hotline. This year we saw an increase in substantiated cases. This is due to a change in our processes to fully capture all cases through the Danfoss Ethics Hotline from 2024, and our efforts to reduce barriers to reporting concerns. Therefore, this development is in line with our expectations and below the industry benchmark.1 In 2024, we received 382 whistleblower reports, of which 135 could be substantiated. For all substantiated cases, corrective actions, ranging from addressing inappropriate behavior to termination of employment, were implemented during the year. Since 2004, we have tracked employee terminations due to unethical or illegal behavior. In 2024, 50 employees left Danfoss due to unethical behavior compared to 74 in 2023 and 32 in 2022. to transparency, integrity, and accountability.

Data exploration and data modeling help us better understand stakeholder needs and insights to improve our services, reduce risks, and improve operational processes.
