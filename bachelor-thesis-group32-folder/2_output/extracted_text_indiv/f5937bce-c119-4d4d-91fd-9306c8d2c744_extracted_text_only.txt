"Case story Collaborating for circularity The transition to a circular economy requires a holistic approach, and therefore, we actively work to foster partnership with our suppliers, customers, and business partners. We do this, for example, through our supplier engagement program, through which we have worked with suppliers to identify opportunities to increase the use of recycled materials. We leverage our partnerships to help scale circular economy initiatives across our industry and raise awareness. Together with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, we have established a network-led project on circular metrics, and we participate in the Circular Design Forum and the Nordic Circularity Accelerator and help shape common definitions in the industrial sector for circularity of products. We have co-funded a research project on circular electronics that aims to develop tools to support product designers in designing for X (e.g., disassembly or reuse). Responsible waste management Danfoss aims to minimize both hazardous and non- hazardous waste in our own operations. In 2024, we have released a Waste Management Policy that defines reporting dimensions and responsibilities for the Danfoss Group. To support the reporting process, we have developed a global reporting tool to improve the data collection process. We apply the Rethink-Reduce- Recirculate principles to our waste management, aiming to increase the reused and recycled content in our products and reduce landfill waste. In 2025, we will leverage this foundation to establish a unified ambition on waste minimization, including defining clear targets. 26% reduced embodied emissions in our heat exchangers In line with Danfoss’ decarbonization commitments, we recently launched our low-carbon MicroChannel heat exchanger solution. This solution reduces the product carbon footprint of our existing heat exchanger solutions by an estimated 26%, with the potential for further reduction in the future. Our new heat exchanger offering is produced using 100% renewable energy while also being more energy efficient, and it contains low-carbon aluminum produced with renewable energy. Applications that benefit from the heat exchanger include Dedicated outside air systems, chillers, cooling applications for residential and commercial buildings, and data centers. 76 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"
"Case story Product safety and compliance We realize our quality and safety commitments through our Product Compliance Policy, the Danfoss Negative List, and our robust compliance program, processes, and tools. In 2024, 86% of Danfoss’ manufacturing sites have obtained certification for quality management system according to ISO 9001 and 11% according to IATF 16949. Digital solutions and data integration As part of our Danfoss digitalization journey, and the growing need for data to meet customer and regulatory needs, the need to strengthen our digital solutions and streamline our data sources has become increasingly apparent. In 2024, we continued to focus on traceability using digital systems and solutions. We continued the roll-out of our common IT infrastructure to support the integration of our product compliance data into one single platform. This year, we initiated the data integration in our joint solutions to also include regulated substance compliance data for full material disclosures (FMDs). FMD data is necessary to enable accurate life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental product declarations (EPD) by disclosing the full composition of products. EPDs are a crucial part of our products’ value proposition to support our customers’ sustainability agenda. The adaptation of our digital solutions enables us to better meet our customers’ data needs while also fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements. In 2025, we will continue to prioritize data availability and focus on enhancing our IT infrastructure. Chemical management and substances of concern In Danfoss, we are observing a rise in regulations relating to substances of concern, such as PFAS. This, in turn, is reflected in the increasing number of data requests we receive from our customers. While Danfoss is not a manufacturer of chemicals, and we do not manufacture articles with intended release of harmful substances, we acknowledge the need to work with our supply chain to identify where harmful substances may exist and how these potentially can be substituted. With the support of our suppliers, we initiated in 2023 a comprehensive mapping of the use of PFAS across our entire product portfolio. During 2024, we continued to collect data that will better enable us to deliver information to our customers which is in line with our aims for increased transparency on materials and substances. In 2025, we will continue to address the use of potentially harmful substances and take further actions to find safer alternatives through collaboration with our suppliers. Life cycle assessments In our efforts to communicate transparently and better understand the environmental impacts of our products over their lifecycle stages, we have in previous years set up processes and focused on training specialists to perform LCAs and complete EPDs. We have in total released over 80 EPDs, of which more than half were published in 2024. In 2025, we aim to have our EPD process verified by a third party. Read more about Policies on Danfoss Business Conduct Our approach to chemical management Environmental Product Declarations Danfoss Position on LCAs and EPDs Delivering EPDs to customers to demonstrate decarbonization efforts Leading by example, we have conducted a pilot project in collaboration with our customer, Trane Technologies, to demonstrate that decarbonization is both possible and feasible in a partnership. This project, focusing on a specific Trane Technologies chiller, will deliver EPDs for two types of heat exchangers (microchannel and brazed plate) and a Turbocor compressor. The EPDs are the official documents which both Trane Technologies and Danfoss use to substantiate the decarbonization impact helping both parties towards reaching our science-based targets. 77 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"
"Environmental management Our commitment is outlined in our Business Conduct Policy and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Policy, which defines minimum requirements for all Danfoss locations. Our environmental management approach is based on international best practices in line with our sustainability agenda. Furthermore, we require that all Danfoss production sites implement and maintain management systems for the environment, health, and safety, compliant with requirements in ISO 14001. In 2024, 76% of our production sites maintained an ISO 14001 certification. Read more about our approach, policies, and reports here Water management Danfoss’ own operations are not water-intensive, and water is primarily used in our production for process cooling. Our global factory footprint spans across all regions of the world, except Africa. Based on a mapping conducted using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we have identified that 11 of our factories are located in regions facing water scarcity and quality issues, which corresponds to 16.6% of Danfoss’ total water withdrawals. Where we operate, our water management is aligned with local legislation, including minimizing the use of harmful chemicals in water treatments and ensuring that processed water is treated before discharge. In 2024, we issued a new internal global water management standard that outlines our commitment to water conservation, water quality management, and responsible water usage in our operations. We aim to continuously reduce our water use with a special focus on sites located in areas with water scarcity. Accountability for this standard lies with our Chief Sustainability Officer. We have initiated additional analysis of our water usage in own operations and upstream value chain to determine the materiality of the Water and Marine Resources Standard (ESRS E3). At Danfoss, we are committed to safeguarding the environment. We take action to reduce our environmental impacts and identify opportunities to become more sustainable. Prevention of pollution Our commitment to prevent pollution of air, water, and soil are set out in our various policies, which apply to the whole of Danfoss, as we acknowledge that preventing pollution requires a holistic approach. These standards and policies define our commitments to protect the environment by preventing pollution by managing and utilizing resources effectively and efficiently. This is necessary to limit our impact on the environment and communities within our own operations and through the products and solutions that we bring to market. Danfoss complies with local requirements at site and legal-entity level, and we also monitor non-GHG air emissions at our sites. In case of potential pollution incidents, we have procedures in place to remediate impacts. We have initiated additional analysis of our global impact to determine the materiality of the Pollution Standard (ESRS E2). Protecting biodiversity and ecosystems During 2024, we have mapped our sites for proximity to biodiversity-sensitive areas. Through this assess- ment, we were able to conclude that Danfoss sites are not located in biodiversity-sensitive areas, but 15 sites were found to be near such areas. Danfoss requires all these areas to maintain management systems for the environment, compliant with requirements in the ISO 14001 standard, which also covers biodiversity-related impacts such as flooding and water stress. In 2025, we will continue to identify and assess our nature-related issues, as guided by the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This approach supports our efforts to assess biodiversity- related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across our value chain. We will also look further into the topic of biodiversity in collaboration with our supply chain partners and customers. 78 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"

Our aim is to provide an inspiring and inclusive work environment where people feel that they belong. Our people activities support us in attracting and retaining the best talent. With the best people, we get the best performance. The representation of women on the Board of Directors is currently 25%. Women in leadership positions is a key metric for improving gender balance in the organization and increased in 2024 to 23.7% (2023: 22.1%), the highest increase ever in the share of women in leadership roles at Danfoss. Improving the gender and nationality diversity of our global leadership teams is also one of our key focus areas. After achieving a very strong increase of 8.1%-points in Management Team Diversity from 2022 to 2023, we saw a decrease of 2.4%-points to 73.1% in 2024. However, we are still on track to meet our target of 80% for 2030. Furthermore, Danfoss is committed to maintaining a gender pay gap below 5%. In 2024, the total pay ratio globally between genders per job category decreased to 6.3% (2023: 6.9%). During 2025, we will intensify our work to minimize this gap. Safety is a priority for Danfoss, and we do not tolerate unsafe behavior and environments. We continue to address and promote health and safety internally through clear policies, continuous safety training, dialogues, and workshops as well as strong leadership role-modeling. As we expand our business, we stay committed to ensuring a healthy and safe working environment. Since 2017, we have almost doubled the size of Danfoss. In 2024, the Lost Time Injury Frequency rate (LTIF) has increased slightly from a record low 1.2 in 2023 to 1.3 in 2024. Also, our Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIF) increased slightly from 2.1 in 2023 to 2.3 in 2024. We expect to get back to 2023 levels during 2025. To support our customers with the best solutions and services, we invest in our people, providing continuous learning and career development opportunities. 80 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Safety First! To meet our commitments, we have established global policies where accountability for health and safety lies with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) leadership. Our EHS Policy and other internal policies are the backbone of how we ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. EHS requirements that apply to external parties, such as contractors working at Danfoss sites, are defined in our contractor safety guidelines. Having an effective prevention and risk-based approach while driving continuous improvements, are the fundamental principles of our approach. To maintain a robust management system, and align with best practices, we require that all our production sites comply with international standards such as ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management systems, and ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Additionally, we comply with local statutory requirements, and all our employees are covered by our EHS management system. Our Health and Well-being Policy promotes well- being, advises on physical and mental health issues, and addresses medical incidents. At Danfoss, we acknowledge the link between employee well-being and a work environment free from harassment and discrimination1. Accountability for well-being in Danfoss lies with our leaders. To achieve our commitment, we have monitoring mechanisms in place, conduct audits, and implement preventive actions accordingly. Our key focus areas and actions taken include • Regular health and safety training for all employees. • Recurring risk assessments of machinery, materials, chemicals and workflows. • Preventive maintenance of machinery to avoid breakdowns and accidents. • An incident alert mechanism ensuring that corrective actions are addressed globally. • Global reporting of potential hazards and implementation of measures to mitigate and/or eliminate risks before such occur. We provide a range of support systems. For example, we have personnel at our sites who are trained in first aid. Furthermore, as part of our benefits program, our employees are covered by health insurance and an employee assistance program (EAP) that offers professional counselling for any work or personal issue and an online resource hub. At Danfoss, we prioritize and protect the physical and psychological safety and health of all employees, and we are committed to creating a safe work environment. We believe it is fundamental that we have an effective health and safety management system in place to sustain a culture that prioritizes safety and well-being. 1 We do not tolerate discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, cast, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, disability, whether physical, mental, or learning, or any other characteristics protected by laws. 2 LTIF adjusted for newly acquired SEMIKRON and BOCK® Compressors is 1.1 and TRIF 2.1. Targets 2024 reflects the inclusion of both. We measure the effectiveness of our actions through our Health and Safety KPIs: LTIF (Lost Time Incidents Frequency) and TRIF (Total Recordable Incidents Frequency). Health & Safety 2023 20242 Target LTIF 1.2 1.3 1.4 TRIF 2.1 2.3 2.4 Fatalities 0 0 - Mental health We believe that promoting mental health in the workplace is crucial as it enhances employee well- being, productivity, and overall organizational success. In 2024, our actions included increasing awareness about mental health, and we introduced a stress management e-learning training for all leaders. The e-learning was piloted in Denmark and will be made available globally in 2025. While recognizing the need for global consistency, Danfoss employees are empowered to implement local initiatives, e.g., through employee resource groups (ERGs) or business segment-, country-, or site-level initiatives. To promote a workplace where everyone feels safe to speak up, share new ideas, and express themselves freely, we have launched a series of psychological safety events. The goal has been to cultivate a common understanding and provide actionable tactics for nurturing psychological safety and ensure that all voices are heard and can contribute to our joint success. 81 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story Case story Eight years without an incident in Wuqing, China We speak up for Safety At Danfoss, we say 'Safety First', and we mean it — it is one of our core focus areas to keep our people safe. In 2024, Danfoss Climate Solutions showed great results with a decrease of 20% in TRIF (total recordable incident frequency) compared to the previous year. The LTIF (lost time incident frequency) was as low as 1.6 which is the best ever recorded result for the segment showing An effective safety organization set up in Danfoss enabled eight years without any incidents at our Wuqing factory in China. The organization comprises six sub-committees: Compliance, Hazard Management, Equipment Safety, Sustainability, Ergonomics, Safety Inspec- tion, and Change. an unwavering commitment toward creating productive and safe workplaces. In May 2024, we highlighted the importance of safety with the theme of 'Spot the Hazard' during our annual safety week. Having a Safety First mindset helps us strive for zero accidents as we take action to prevent them from happening in the first place. The three main goals of the organization are a safer factory, healthier employees, and a better protected work environment. The organization generated an employee safety culture and awareness, and increased the digital management of the factory. 82 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"High-performing, diverse teams Our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. We expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. In 2024, Danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. We have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. This means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all Danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. Responsibility for our people strategy lies with our Executive Vice President, Group Human Resources. We know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. We have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. Focus areas in 2024 We continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. A key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining Danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many Danfoss colleagues. Our five global ERG themes cover Abilities — Gender, Generations, Multicultural and Nations, and Pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. Activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in STEM, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. Danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. We have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our President & CEO. The programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. Talent development Developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of Danfoss. By providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. Along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. Focus areas in 2024 People development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. We apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. We have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. Additionally, we have We firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. We strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. We have succession plans in place for all critical roles at Danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. To support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like INSEAD. To support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. In 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our INSEAD program. The Executive Transitions Program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. Members of the Group Execu- tive Team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. In 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. Our Global Mentoring Program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. In 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. We also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"The Danfoss Postgraduate Program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. In 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. Striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. Equal pay for work of equal value Equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. The basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such Danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. Our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. To prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. This is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. The total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. During the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. During the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. The gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). Our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. To prepare for the EU Pay Transparency Directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on EU countries as a starting point. Following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the EU countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. In 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. To ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and HR professionals who execute pay decisions together. Living wage At Danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. We are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. This means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. In 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all Danfoss employees receive a living wage. To date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story To enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want Danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. In 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. Psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. It creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation. In conclusion, a safe environment forms the foundation for addressing biases and fostering a growth mindset, thus leading to better performance. Engaging with our people To ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including HR- and IT-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ERGs. Focus areas in 2024 Our four Danfoss AskHR hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. We encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. Regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. To promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. Our global engagement survey, the Voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. It is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. The survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at Danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. All teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. Our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. Additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. Our work councils are organized at the local, national, and European level. The Danfoss European Works Council (DEWC) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. The DEWC consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. Meeting minutes are published on our intranet. In 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-EU countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. A few examples come from the US, where Danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and Latin America and China, where Danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities.

In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story To enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want Danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. In 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. Psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. It creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation. In conclusion, a safe environment forms the foundation for addressing biases and fostering a growth mindset, thus leading to better performance. Engaging with our people To ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including HR- and IT-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ERGs. Focus areas in 2024 Our four Danfoss AskHR hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. We encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. Regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. To promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. Our global engagement survey, the Voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. It is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. The survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at Danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. All teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. Our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. Additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. Our work councils are organized at the local, national, and European level. The Danfoss European Works Council (DEWC) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. The DEWC consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. Meeting minutes are published on our intranet. In 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-EU countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. A few examples come from the US, where Danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and Latin America and China, where Danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities.

Human rights due diligence Our human rights due diligence process is based on a regional, risk-based approach to assess human rights issues in the regions in which we operate. Our approach enables us to identify and address adverse impacts and human rights risks and to implement mitigation and prevention measures. To ensure our approach and processes are effective, we regularly monitor and evaluate the outcome of our activities and due diligence efforts. To gain further insight into the perspectives of vulnerable and marginalized stakeholders, we also actively engage and participate in the Nordic Business Network for Human Rights, coordinated by the Danish Institute for Human Rights. As a global company, human and labor rights have always been a priority. At Danfoss, we believe that human rights are about respecting and protecting the dignity of all people.

"The Whistleblower function — including the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which is publicly available — plays an important role in helping us identify and understand where and how human rights impacts may be taking place in our value chain. If we find that Danfoss has caused or contributed to actual negative impacts on human rights, we will ensure that we meet our responsibilities according to the UNGPs. This means that we will ensure that remediation actions are taken and remedy is provided for impacted people. The actions we take are determined on a case-by-case basis and depend on whether our role as a business is directly linked or contributed to the negative impact. Through our human rights due diligence process, we have identified salient human rights issues. These are human rights that are at the greatest risk of severe negative impact. To address these risks and potential adverse impacts, we work proactively to mitigate and prevent human rights-related risks in our value chain. As part of our due diligence process, we monitor our activities to ensure progress in our risk prevention and risk mitigation. Regular follow-up ensures that progress is monitored and countries with the highest risk of negative impacts are prioritized. For example, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, all our factories are covered by our 'Safety First' program and have actions in place to prevent excessive working hours during peak seasons. We actively work to raise awareness on topics such as discrimination and have processes established to prevent discrimination in the workplace. Our responsibility to respect human rights extends across our value chain as defined by the UN Guiding Principles. In previous years, we conducted an assessment to identify our salient human rights issues. One of the key issues identified relates to modern slavery, including forced labor, child labor, prison labor, and human trafficking. Our requirements for our employees and suppliers are clearly defined in our Danfoss Ethics Handbook and our Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct, and they are integrated into our supplier onboarding and monitoring mechanisms. Additional information on how we work to address and mitigate modern slavery risks is found in the Danfoss Modern Slavery Act Statement which is available here Key actions in 2024 In 2024, we continued to assess and strengthen our due diligence processes in pursuance of existing and incoming regulation on sustainability due diligence. We also conducted an internal mapping against the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) to gain a better understanding of potential areas for improvement. Furthermore, we strengthened our due diligence regarding potential military end-use of our products. During the year, we also updated our Human Rights Policy to reflect our commitment on human rights due diligence. Going forward, in 2025 we will focus on actions that aim to increase transparency of our value chain and strengthen our risk assessment and due diligence processes. Responsible mineral sourcing and conflict minerals Minerals such as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold that originate from conflicted or high-risk areas are known as conflict minerals as these are used to finance armed conflicts and human rights abuses. Danfoss supports the efforts of governments and organizations to end human rights abuses and violations in conflict areas. Danfoss is therefore committed to sourcing materials and components from companies that also share our values regarding human rights, ethics, and environmental responsibility. To support the Responsible Minerals Initiative and to enable responsible sourcing decision-making, we review whether the tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold in our products originate from conflict-affected or high-risk regions. As part of this work, we engage with our suppliers on an ongoing basis through, for example, our recurring campaigns to acquire supplier information on conflict minerals, including smelter/ refiner identification and country of origin. Through our supplier engagement approach, we are able to reach 1,500 tier one suppliers on an annual basis to address this topic. This has enabled us to provide conflict minerals reporting templates (CMRT) to our customers and initiate relevant due diligence activities to mitigate high risk smelters in our supply chain.

"Business conduct The basis of our business culture is defined in our global Business Conduct Policy and the Danfoss Ethics Handbook. The handbook is based on the Danfoss Values as well as principles from international conventions and guidelines supporting sustainable development, such as UN Global Compact, UN Guiding Principles, and ILO’s core conventions on labor rights. Our guidelines on business conduct help our employees live up to our values and policies. The guidelines are available in multiple languages and cover topics such as corruption and bribery, fraud, discrimination, human rights, donations, fair competition, and conflicts of interest. All employees are expected to follow the Danfoss Ethics Handbook as it is part of our employee agreements and regular mandatory training. To develop, promote, and evaluate our corporate culture, Danfoss has established a comprehensive compliance program. The program includes annual compliance training on the topics of ethics, export control, fair competition, anti-corruption, and data privacy. The program is mandatory for all employees considered to be in a position of higher risk in relation to these topics or at a director level or above. To promote responsible business conduct, a continual focus on ethical issues and topics forms part of our approach. The Danfoss Board of Directors is responsible for oversight on ethics and compliance, and the Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the compliance program. Responsibility for day-to-day ethics and compliance activities is anchored with the respective business segments and functions. Compliance risks relating to business conduct are regularly monitored via our Enterprise Risk Management. Prevention and detection of bribery and corruption At Danfoss, we have a zero-tolerance policy for bribery and corruption. To prevent unethical and illegal practices, our compliance program covers ethics and corruption risk assessments, continuous risk monitoring, and it enables implementation of Acting responsibly has been a part of Danfoss’ core values since our foundation and is instrumental in our ability to build leading positions across multiple industries and global locations. mitigating measures. Additionally, the program includes mandatory training to promote awareness and knowledge building on topics such as bribery, kickbacks, facilitation payments, nepotism, and conflict of interest. Such training is mandatory for all at-risk functions, such as our sales, procurement, finance, supply chain and operations, and public affairs functions. To ensure the effectiveness of our training and our compliance approach, we periodically review all trainings and compliance procedures. We actively encourage and support our employees to report through the Ethics Hotline any concerns or observations of actual or potential policy violations regarding bribery and corruption. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives updates on the number, nature, impact, and outcome of the reported cases. Whistleblower function To maintain a culture that reflects our values and ethical business practices, we promote a speak-up culture where concerns can be trusted to be handled confidentially and without fear of retaliation. The Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which is hosted by an external operator, serves as our whistleblower function and a grievance mechanism for human rights. The platform ensures full compliance with EU GDPR, worldwide data protection regulations, and regulatory requirements regarding whistleblower protection as set out in the EU Whistleblowing Directive. The hotline is publicly available, accessible through the Danfoss website, and available in many languages for worldwide use. The hotline not only allows Danfoss employees to raise concerns and grievances but also provides suppliers, customers, workers in the value chain, and other third parties to have a formal channel for raising concerns. 90 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Governance"
"Safety First! To meet our commitments, we have established global policies where accountability for health and safety lies with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) leadership. Our EHS Policy and other internal policies are the backbone of how we ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. EHS requirements that apply to external parties, such as contractors working at Danfoss sites, are defined in our contractor safety guidelines. Having an effective prevention and risk-based approach while driving continuous improvements, are the fundamental principles of our approach. To maintain a robust management system, and align with best practices, we require that all our production sites comply with international standards such as ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management systems, and ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Additionally, we comply with local statutory requirements, and all our employees are covered by our EHS management system. Our Health and Well-being Policy promotes well- being, advises on physical and mental health issues, and addresses medical incidents. At Danfoss, we acknowledge the link between employee well-being and a work environment free from harassment and discrimination1. Accountability for well-being in Danfoss lies with our leaders. To achieve our commitment, we have monitoring mechanisms in place, conduct audits, and implement preventive actions accordingly. Our key focus areas and actions taken include • Regular health and safety training for all employees. • Recurring risk assessments of machinery, materials, chemicals and workflows. • Preventive maintenance of machinery to avoid breakdowns and accidents. • An incident alert mechanism ensuring that corrective actions are addressed globally. • Global reporting of potential hazards and implementation of measures to mitigate and/or eliminate risks before such occur. We provide a range of support systems. For example, we have personnel at our sites who are trained in first aid. Furthermore, as part of our benefits program, our employees are covered by health insurance and an employee assistance program (EAP) that offers professional counselling for any work or personal issue and an online resource hub. At Danfoss, we prioritize and protect the physical and psychological safety and health of all employees, and we are committed to creating a safe work environment. We believe it is fundamental that we have an effective health and safety management system in place to sustain a culture that prioritizes safety and well-being. 1 We do not tolerate discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, cast, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, disability, whether physical, mental, or learning, or any other characteristics protected by laws. 2 LTIF adjusted for newly acquired SEMIKRON and BOCK® Compressors is 1.1 and TRIF 2.1. Targets 2024 reflects the inclusion of both. We measure the effectiveness of our actions through our Health and Safety KPIs: LTIF (Lost Time Incidents Frequency) and TRIF (Total Recordable Incidents Frequency). Health & Safety 2023 20242 Target LTIF 1.2 1.3 1.4 TRIF 2.1 2.3 2.4 Fatalities 0 0 - Mental health We believe that promoting mental health in the workplace is crucial as it enhances employee well- being, productivity, and overall organizational success. In 2024, our actions included increasing awareness about mental health, and we introduced a stress management e-learning training for all leaders. The e-learning was piloted in Denmark and will be made available globally in 2025. While recognizing the need for global consistency, Danfoss employees are empowered to implement local initiatives, e.g., through employee resource groups (ERGs) or business segment-, country-, or site-level initiatives. To promote a workplace where everyone feels safe to speak up, share new ideas, and express themselves freely, we have launched a series of psychological safety events. The goal has been to cultivate a common understanding and provide actionable tactics for nurturing psychological safety and ensure that all voices are heard and can contribute to our joint success. 81 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"

"High-performing, diverse teams Our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. We expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. In 2024, Danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. We have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. This means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all Danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. Responsibility for our people strategy lies with our Executive Vice President, Group Human Resources. We know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. We have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. Focus areas in 2024 We continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. A key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining Danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many Danfoss colleagues. Our five global ERG themes cover Abilities — Gender, Generations, Multicultural and Nations, and Pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. Activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in STEM, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. Danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. We have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our President & CEO. The programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. Talent development Developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of Danfoss. By providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. Along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. Focus areas in 2024 People development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. We apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. We have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. Additionally, we have We firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. We strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. We have succession plans in place for all critical roles at Danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. To support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like INSEAD. To support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. In 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our INSEAD program. The Executive Transitions Program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. Members of the Group Execu- tive Team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. In 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. Our Global Mentoring Program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. In 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. We also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"The Danfoss Postgraduate Program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. In 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. Striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. Equal pay for work of equal value Equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. The basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such Danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. Our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. To prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. This is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. The total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. During the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. During the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. The gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). Our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. To prepare for the EU Pay Transparency Directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on EU countries as a starting point. Following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the EU countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. In 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. To ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and HR professionals who execute pay decisions together. Living wage At Danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. We are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. This means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. In 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all Danfoss employees receive a living wage. To date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story To enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want Danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. In 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. Psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. It creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation.

Engaging with our people To ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including HR- and IT-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ERGs. Focus areas in 2024 Our four Danfoss AskHR hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. We encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. Regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. To promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. Our global engagement survey, the Voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. It is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. The survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at Danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. All teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. Our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. Additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. Our work councils are organized at the local, national, and European level. The Danfoss European Works Council (DEWC) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. The DEWC consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. Meeting minutes are published on our intranet. In 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-EU countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. A few examples come from the US, where Danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and Latin America and China, where Danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities.

"Environmental management Our commitment is outlined in our Business Conduct Policy and Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) Policy, which defines minimum requirements for all Danfoss locations. Our environmental management approach is based on international best practices in line with our sustainability agenda. Furthermore, we require that all Danfoss production sites implement and maintain management systems for the environment, health, and safety, compliant with requirements in ISO 14001. In 2024, 76% of our production sites maintained an ISO 14001 certification. Read more about our approach, policies, and reports here Water management Danfoss’ own operations are not water-intensive, and water is primarily used in our production for process cooling. Our global factory footprint spans across all regions of the world, except Africa. Based on a mapping conducted using the WWF Water Risk Filter, we have identified that 11 of our factories are located in regions facing water scarcity and quality issues, which corresponds to 16.6% of Danfoss’ total water withdrawals. Where we operate, our water management is aligned with local legislation, including minimizing the use of harmful chemicals in water treatments and ensuring that processed water is treated before discharge. In 2024, we issued a new internal global water management standard that outlines our commitment to water conservation, water quality management, and responsible water usage in our operations. We aim to continuously reduce our water use with a special focus on sites located in areas with water scarcity. Accountability for this standard lies with our Chief Sustainability Officer. We have initiated additional analysis of our water usage in own operations and upstream value chain to determine the materiality of the Water and Marine Resources Standard (ESRS E3). At Danfoss, we are committed to safeguarding the environment. We take action to reduce our environmental impacts and identify opportunities to become more sustainable. Prevention of pollution Our commitment to prevent pollution of air, water, and soil are set out in our various policies, which apply to the whole of Danfoss, as we acknowledge that preventing pollution requires a holistic approach. These standards and policies define our commitments to protect the environment by preventing pollution by managing and utilizing resources effectively and efficiently. This is necessary to limit our impact on the environment and communities within our own operations and through the products and solutions that we bring to market. Danfoss complies with local requirements at site and legal-entity level, and we also monitor non-GHG air emissions at our sites. In case of potential pollution incidents, we have procedures in place to remediate impacts. We have initiated additional analysis of our global impact to determine the materiality of the Pollution Standard (ESRS E2). Protecting biodiversity and ecosystems During 2024, we have mapped our sites for proximity to biodiversity-sensitive areas. Through this assess- ment, we were able to conclude that Danfoss sites are not located in biodiversity-sensitive areas, but 15 sites were found to be near such areas. Danfoss requires all these areas to maintain management systems for the environment, compliant with requirements in the ISO 14001 standard, which also covers biodiversity-related impacts such as flooding and water stress. In 2025, we will continue to identify and assess our nature-related issues, as guided by the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD). This approach supports our efforts to assess biodiversity- related dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities across our value chain. We will also look further into the topic of biodiversity in collaboration with our supply chain partners and customers. 78 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"

Our aim is to provide an inspiring and inclusive work environment where people feel that they belong. Our people activities support us in attracting and retaining the best talent. With the best people, we get the best performance. The representation of women on the Board of Directors is currently 25%. Women in leadership positions is a key metric for improving gender balance in the organization and increased in 2024 to 23.7% (2023: 22.1%), the highest increase ever in the share of women in leadership roles at Danfoss. Improving the gender and nationality diversity of our global leadership teams is also one of our key focus areas. After achieving a very strong increase of 8.1%-points in Management Team Diversity from 2022 to 2023, we saw a decrease of 2.4%-points to 73.1% in 2024. However, we are still on track to meet our target of 80% for 2030. Furthermore, Danfoss is committed to maintaining a gender pay gap below 5%. In 2024, the total pay ratio globally between genders per job category decreased to 6.3% (2023: 6.9%). During 2025, we will intensify our work to minimize this gap. Safety is a priority for Danfoss, and we do not tolerate unsafe behavior and environments. We continue to address and promote health and safety internally through clear policies, continuous safety training, dialogues, and workshops as well as strong leadership role-modeling. As we expand our business, we stay committed to ensuring a healthy and safe working environment. Since 2017, we have almost doubled the size of Danfoss. In 2024, the Lost Time Injury Frequency rate (LTIF) has increased slightly from a record low 1.2 in 2023 to 1.3 in 2024. Also, our Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIF) increased slightly from 2.1 in 2023 to 2.3 in 2024. We expect to get back to 2023 levels during 2025.

"Safety First! To meet our commitments, we have established global policies where accountability for health and safety lies with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) leadership. Our EHS Policy and other internal policies are the backbone of how we ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. EHS requirements that apply to external parties, such as contractors working at Danfoss sites, are defined in our contractor safety guidelines. Having an effective prevention and risk-based approach while driving continuous improvements, are the fundamental principles of our approach. To maintain a robust management system, and align with best practices, we require that all our production sites comply with international standards such as ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management systems, and ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Additionally, we comply with local statutory requirements, and all our employees are covered by our EHS management system. Our Health and Well-being Policy promotes well- being, advises on physical and mental health issues, and addresses medical incidents. At Danfoss, we acknowledge the link between employee well-being and a work environment free from harassment and discrimination1. Accountability for well-being in Danfoss lies with our leaders. To achieve our commitment, we have monitoring mechanisms in place, conduct audits, and implement preventive actions accordingly. Our key focus areas and actions taken include • Regular health and safety training for all employees. • Recurring risk assessments of machinery, materials, chemicals and workflows. • Preventive maintenance of machinery to avoid breakdowns and accidents. • An incident alert mechanism ensuring that corrective actions are addressed globally. • Global reporting of potential hazards and implementation of measures to mitigate and/or eliminate risks before such occur. We provide a range of support systems. For example, we have personnel at our sites who are trained in first aid. Furthermore, as part of our benefits program, our employees are covered by health insurance and an employee assistance program (EAP) that offers professional counselling for any work or personal issue and an online resource hub. At Danfoss, we prioritize and protect the physical and psychological safety and health of all employees, and we are committed to creating a safe work environment. We believe it is fundamental that we have an effective health and safety management system in place to sustain a culture that prioritizes safety and well-being. 1 We do not tolerate discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, cast, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, disability, whether physical, mental, or learning, or any other characteristics protected by laws. 2 LTIF adjusted for newly acquired SEMIKRON and BOCK® Compressors is 1.1 and TRIF 2.1. Targets 2024 reflects the inclusion of both. We measure the effectiveness of our actions through our Health and Safety KPIs: LTIF (Lost Time Incidents Frequency) and TRIF (Total Recordable Incidents Frequency). Health & Safety 2023 20242 Target LTIF 1.2 1.3 1.4 TRIF 2.1 2.3 2.4 Fatalities 0 0 - Mental health We believe that promoting mental health in the workplace is crucial as it enhances employee well- being, productivity, and overall organizational success. In 2024, our actions included increasing awareness about mental health, and we introduced a stress management e-learning training for all leaders. The e-learning was piloted in Denmark and will be made available globally in 2025. While recognizing the need for global consistency, Danfoss employees are empowered to implement local initiatives, e.g., through employee resource groups (ERGs) or business segment-, country-, or site-level initiatives. To promote a workplace where everyone feels safe to speak up, share new ideas, and express themselves freely, we have launched a series of psychological safety events. The goal has been to cultivate a common understanding and provide actionable tactics for nurturing psychological safety and ensure that all voices are heard and can contribute to our joint success. 81 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story Case story Eight years without an incident in Wuqing, China We speak up for Safety At Danfoss, we say 'Safety First', and we mean it — it is one of our core focus areas to keep our people safe. In 2024, Danfoss Climate Solutions showed great results with a decrease of 20% in TRIF (total recordable incident frequency) compared to the previous year. The LTIF (lost time incident frequency) was as low as 1.6 which is the best ever recorded result for the segment showing An effective safety organization set up in Danfoss enabled eight years without any incidents at our Wuqing factory in China. The organization comprises six sub-committees: Compliance, Hazard Management, Equipment Safety, Sustainability, Ergonomics, Safety Inspec- tion, and Change. an unwavering commitment toward creating productive and safe workplaces. In May 2024, we highlighted the importance of safety with the theme of 'Spot the Hazard' during our annual safety week. Having a Safety First mindset helps us strive for zero accidents as we take action to prevent them from happening in the first place. The three main goals of the organization are a safer factory, healthier employees, and a better protected work environment. The organization generated an employee safety culture and awareness, and increased the digital management of the factory. 82 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story Collaborating for circularity The transition to a circular economy requires a holistic approach, and therefore, we actively work to foster partnership with our suppliers, customers, and business partners. We do this, for example, through our supplier engagement program, through which we have worked with suppliers to identify opportunities to increase the use of recycled materials. We leverage our partnerships to help scale circular economy initiatives across our industry and raise awareness. Together with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, we have established a network-led project on circular metrics, and we participate in the Circular Design Forum and the Nordic Circularity Accelerator and help shape common definitions in the industrial sector for circularity of products. We have co-funded a research project on circular electronics that aims to develop tools to support product designers in designing for X (e.g., disassembly or reuse). Responsible waste management Danfoss aims to minimize both hazardous and non- hazardous waste in our own operations. In 2024, we have released a Waste Management Policy that defines reporting dimensions and responsibilities for the Danfoss Group. To support the reporting process, we have developed a global reporting tool to improve the data collection process. We apply the Rethink-Reduce- Recirculate principles to our waste management, aiming to increase the reused and recycled content in our products and reduce landfill waste. In 2025, we will leverage this foundation to establish a unified ambition on waste minimization, including defining clear targets. 26% reduced embodied emissions in our heat exchangers In line with Danfoss’ decarbonization commitments, we recently launched our low-carbon MicroChannel heat exchanger solution. This solution reduces the product carbon footprint of our existing heat exchanger solutions by an estimated 26%, with the potential for further reduction in the future. Our new heat exchanger offering is produced using 100% renewable energy while also being more energy efficient, and it contains low-carbon aluminum produced with renewable energy. Applications that benefit from the heat exchanger include Dedicated outside air systems, chillers, cooling applications for residential and commercial buildings, and data centers. 76 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"
"Case story Product safety and compliance We realize our quality and safety commitments through our Product Compliance Policy, the Danfoss Negative List, and our robust compliance program, processes, and tools. In 2024, 86% of Danfoss’ manufacturing sites have obtained certification for quality management system according to ISO 9001 and 11% according to IATF 16949. Digital solutions and data integration As part of our Danfoss digitalization journey, and the growing need for data to meet customer and regulatory needs, the need to strengthen our digital solutions and streamline our data sources has become increasingly apparent. In 2024, we continued to focus on traceability using digital systems and solutions. We continued the roll-out of our common IT infrastructure to support the integration of our product compliance data into one single platform. This year, we initiated the data integration in our joint solutions to also include regulated substance compliance data for full material disclosures (FMDs). FMD data is necessary to enable accurate life cycle assessment (LCA) and environmental product declarations (EPD) by disclosing the full composition of products. EPDs are a crucial part of our products’ value proposition to support our customers’ sustainability agenda. The adaptation of our digital solutions enables us to better meet our customers’ data needs while also fulfilling regulatory reporting requirements. In 2025, we will continue to prioritize data availability and focus on enhancing our IT infrastructure. Chemical management and substances of concern In Danfoss, we are observing a rise in regulations relating to substances of concern, such as PFAS. This, in turn, is reflected in the increasing number of data requests we receive from our customers. While Danfoss is not a manufacturer of chemicals, and we do not manufacture articles with intended release of harmful substances, we acknowledge the need to work with our supply chain to identify where harmful substances may exist and how these potentially can be substituted. With the support of our suppliers, we initiated in 2023 a comprehensive mapping of the use of PFAS across our entire product portfolio. During 2024, we continued to collect data that will better enable us to deliver information to our customers which is in line with our aims for increased transparency on materials and substances. In 2025, we will continue to address the use of potentially harmful substances and take further actions to find safer alternatives through collaboration with our suppliers. Life cycle assessments In our efforts to communicate transparently and better understand the environmental impacts of our products over their lifecycle stages, we have in previous years set up processes and focused on training specialists to perform LCAs and complete EPDs. We have in total released over 80 EPDs, of which more than half were published in 2024. In 2025, we aim to have our EPD process verified by a third party. Read more about Policies on Danfoss Business Conduct Our approach to chemical management Environmental Product Declarations Danfoss Position on LCAs and EPDs Delivering EPDs to customers to demonstrate decarbonization efforts Leading by example, we have conducted a pilot project in collaboration with our customer, Trane Technologies, to demonstrate that decarbonization is both possible and feasible in a partnership. This project, focusing on a specific Trane Technologies chiller, will deliver EPDs for two types of heat exchangers (microchannel and brazed plate) and a Turbocor compressor. The EPDs are the official documents which both Trane Technologies and Danfoss use to substantiate the decarbonization impact helping both parties towards reaching our science-based targets. 77 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"

"Governance Board of Directors Gender split, Board of Directors The split between genders in the Board of Directors is reported as the ratio of men to women of members of the Board of Directors. Board independence Board independence shows to what extent Board members elected by the general assembly are independent from Danfoss. The Board of Directors’ independence is determined through criteria that follows the recommendations from the Committee on Corporate Governance in Denmark. Ethics and Human Rights Whistleblower cases Whistleblower cases are reported as the total number of new whistleblower cases received through Danfoss’ own Ethics Hotline. Ratio of suppliers-signed code of conduct This data point is reported as total direct (materials) spend on suppliers who have signed the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct in relation to total direct spend. For 2024, the data comprises the total Group excluding BOCK® Compressors. Circularity New product development target The target assesses all Danfoss products that go through the ‘new product development’ database and measures the % of these that have performed an assessment by using our internal tool RE:CIRC. The tool has been verified by a third party and aligned with the waste hierarchy and standard EN 45560 for circular design of products. The assessment is done on the basis of 30 guidelines that are relevant for circular design, including evaluation of durability, repairability, design of disassembly, recyclability, recycled content, etc. Improvement is assessed on an overall improvement of the final score by ensuring improvement in at least one or more of the above-mentioned principles. In the future, we foresee that the measurement of the target will refer to the projects that have been launched in the market, as this is how we will be able to measure the circularity impact. During the first years of implementation, this is not possible to be demonstrated, so we are reporting the percentage of new product development projects that have started that have performed at least one assessment and these that have demonstrated improvement. Circular business revenues target The target includes all revenues from • Refurbished and remanufactured products that are sold • Sale of spare parts for our own products • Digital services that aim to prolong the system’s lifetime (e.g., remote monitoring, preventive maintenance) • Product as a service model • Repair and retrofit activities 107 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Appendix"

"Accounting policies to the consolidated ESG statement Reporting period Unless otherwise stated, the consolidated ESG statement cover the period from January 1 to December 31, 2024. Environment Climate Primary data on scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions constitutes the largest proportion of emissions data. This includes data from digital and manual meter readings and consumption data from invoices. Locations with primary data cover Danfoss factories, currently approximately 2.2 million m2 out of Danfoss’ total real estate footprint of 2.5 million m2, corresponding to 87%. For the remaining part of Danfoss locations where no consumption and emissions data are available, average consumption values per m2 have been applied to estimate energy consumption and GHG emissions. For 2024, this amounted to 4% of total scope 1 and 2 emissions (market-based). If available, calculations of GHG emissions are based on emission factors from invoices from energy suppliers. Otherwise, the most recent available emission factors from IEA are applied. All GHG emissions are converted to CO2 equivalents (CO2e). Scope 1 GHG emissions Scope 1 GHG emissions include direct emissions from combustion of gas and oil, fugitive emissions and mileage in Danfoss-owned or -controlled vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions (market-based) Scope 2 GHG emissions include indirect emissions from purchased heating and electricity. Market-based emissions factors were applied, which implies that power purchase agreements (PPAs) of green energy and other renewable sourcing of energy influences the calculation. Where no market-based emissions factors are available, location-based emissions factors from IEA were applied. For 2024 emissions, 2023 factors were applied as the new factors were not available at the time of publishing this report. Scope 2 GHG emissions (location-based) Scope 2 GHG emissions include indirect emissions from purchased heating and electricity. Location-based emissions factors from IEA have been applied. For 2024 emissions, 2023 factors were applied as the new factors were not available at the time of publishing this report. Scope 3 GHG emissions During 2024, Danfoss worked intensely with improving calculation methodology and data completeness related the material categories within our scope 3 reporting, which are C1, C4, C9, and C11. This work has been coordinated across our three segments. The applied emissions factors for energy and fuel consumption are from IEA, DEFRA 2024, and suppliers. The materials emissions factors used are from the Sphera database. Transportation emissions are calculated using suppliers’ emissions reports. 2022 2023 2024 Scope 1 GHG emissions (tCO2e) Total Danfoss excluding recent acquisitions 80,565 43,973 43,972 Eaton’s hydraulics business 30,122 27,001 22,898 Semikron Danfoss - 93,491 63,617 BOCK® Compressors - - 255 Total 110,687 164,465 130,742 2022 2023 2024 Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions (tCO2e) Total Danfoss excluding recent acquisitions 159,967 150,480 104,532 Eaton's hydraulics business 124,950 104,807 100,262 Semikron Danfoss - 6,935 9,451 BOCK® Compressors - - 1,757 Total 284,917 262,222 216,002 102 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Appendix"
"Scope 3 GHG emissions include indirect emissions from the following categories (C): • C1 Purchased goods and services: covers direct and indirect spend on materials. The direct spend calculation uses a combination of average-data method and the hybrid method together with emission factors from the GaBi tool. For indirect spend, we use the spend-based method and apply emission factors from the Danish Klimakompasset. • C2 Capital goods: includes acquisition of machines and real estate based on the average spend-based method multiplied by emissions factors from the Danish Klimakompasset. • C3 Fuel- and energy-related activities: covers emissions from energy not already included in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions based on average country emissions factors from IEA. • C4 Upstream transportation and distribution: covers intercompany flows, supplier and customer flows paid by Danfoss, 3PL warehouses, and supplier flows not paid by Danfoss. Calculation is based on supplier emissions reports, where available, combined with spend-based calculation of remaining volume. • C5 Waste generated in operations: includes emissions from total waste within each waste category going into each disposal method multiplied by emission factors from IEA. • C6 Business travel: based on total number of flights grouped into short-haul (<3,700km) and long-haul (>3,700km) multiplied by DEFRA emission factors from 2024. • C7 Employee commuting: calculation method based on average commuting data combined with mode of transportation. • C8 Upstream leased assets: includes emissions from leased locations, mainly Danfoss sales office locations not already included in scope 1 and 2. • C9 Downstream transportation and distribution: covers customer flows not paid by Danfoss. Calculation based on incoterms and volume per transportation mode. • C11 Use of sold products: covers the use-phase emissions from sold products in the reporting year over their expected lifetime. Lifetime power consumption is converted into emissions using global IEA CO2e emissions per kWh. To the extent that Danfoss can determine the country or region the product is used, we apply country or regional emissions factors for that volume of sold products. GHG intensity — GHG emissions (location-based) GHG intensity is reported as total GHG emissions (location-based) in metric tons per EURm net sales. GHG intensity — GHG emissions (market-based) GHG intensity is reported as total GHG emissions (market-based) in metric tons per EURm net sales. • C12 End-of-life treatment of sold products: reported as emissions from disposal or treatment of materials reported in C1 Purchased goods and services. • C13 Downstream leased assets: covers two passenger airplanes owned by Danfoss A/S and leased by the local airline company. 2022 2023 2024 Scope 3 GHG emissions (tCO2e) Total Danfoss excluding recent acquisitions 83,405,239 84,507,868 94,105,070 Eaton's hydraulics business 1,145,232 1,012,119 682,717 Semikron Danfoss - 41,969,451 25,113,923 BOCK® Compressors - - 3,991,625 Total 84,550,471 127,489,438 123,893,335 103 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Appendix"
"Energy Includes the total energy consumption of oil, natural gas, electricity, and district heating converted to megawatt hours (MWh). Energy intensity is reported as energy consumption (MWh) per EURm net sales according to Note 2 of the income statement. Danfoss activities are within NACE Code section C, Manufacturing and therefore are considered to be a high-impact climate sector. Renewable share of energy consumption. The renewable energy ratio is determined by average energy mix from suppliers, by energy generated from own solar parks, or via PPAs of renewable energy. Water Water withdrawals (m3) Water is reported as water withdrawals in m3. Primary data on water withdrawals is available for Danfoss production locations while the remaining locations are estimated by industry average data. The estimated part accounts for 7% of the total water withdrawals. Total water withdrawals in areas at material water risk Water withdrawals in regions facing challenges related to water scarcity are mapped using the WWF Water Risk Filter. 11 of our factories are located in regions identified as regions facing challenges related to water scarcity, corresponding to 16.6% of the Danfoss’ total water withdrawals. The WWF Risk Filter has been updated as of 2024. This means that Danfoss factories in Türkiye as well as some in Mexico and India, are no longer classified as being located in water-stressed areas. Water intensity Water intensity is measured as water withdrawals in m3 per EURm net sales. Waste Primary data from waste-handler companies is available for most Danfoss production locations. In production locations where data has not been collected, an average waste generation per m2 has been calculated and used as an assumption. In remaining locations (Danfoss sales office, light industrial locations, and warehouses), waste generation per employee is calculated (based on a survey from the Business Resource Efficiency Guide).

"Social People Number of employees The number of employees is measured by headcount at the end of year, including employees on leave. Employee turnover Employee turnover is reported as the percentage of employees who left Danfoss, including voluntary exits, involuntary exits, and retirements, divided by the average headcount over a 12-month period. Employee engagement score The global Voice employee engagement survey has been performed every 2 year since 2007. The survey is run by an external provider, who ensures that all data and results remain anonymous and treated confidentially. Gender split, all employees The split between genders for the total workforce is measured by headcount and reported as the percentage of women, men, and other employees. Employees can voluntarily self-identify their gender in the HR system. Gender split, all leadership positions The split between genders in all leadership positions is measured by headcount and reported as the percentage of women, men, and other employees in leadership positions. Leaders are defined as having a team reporting directly to them. Gender split, top management level The split between genders in top management level 1-4. Management team diversity Management team diversity is measured on manager levels 1-4. Teams of at least five employees (excluding administrative assistants) are diverse if they are composed of at least two genders and two nationalities. The team is considered non-diverse if only one of these requirements is met. Pay ratio between gender and job categories The pay ratio between genders is reported both as the general pay ratio between men and women employees and as the pay ratio within job categories (equal pay for equal work). The general pay ratio between genders is determined as the average salary for men compared to the average salary for women. Pay ratio within job categories shows the average pay ratio between employees in the same job categories. Data from Hydro-Gear is not included in this pay ration calculation.

"Case story Case story Eight years without an incident in Wuqing, China We speak up for Safety At Danfoss, we say 'Safety First', and we mean it — it is one of our core focus areas to keep our people safe. In 2024, Danfoss Climate Solutions showed great results with a decrease of 20% in TRIF (total recordable incident frequency) compared to the previous year. The LTIF (lost time incident frequency) was as low as 1.6 which is the best ever recorded result for the segment showing An effective safety organization set up in Danfoss enabled eight years without any incidents at our Wuqing factory in China. The organization comprises six sub-committees: Compliance, Hazard Management, Equipment Safety, Sustainability, Ergonomics, Safety Inspec- tion, and Change. an unwavering commitment toward creating productive and safe workplaces. In May 2024, we highlighted the importance of safety with the theme of 'Spot the Hazard' during our annual safety week. Having a Safety First mindset helps us strive for zero accidents as we take action to prevent them from happening in the first place. The three main goals of the organization are a safer factory, healthier employees, and a better protected work environment. The organization generated an employee safety culture and awareness, and increased the digital management of the factory. 82 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"High-performing, diverse teams Our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. We expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. In 2024, Danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. We have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. This means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all Danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. Responsibility for our people strategy lies with our Executive Vice President, Group Human Resources. We know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. We have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. Focus areas in 2024 We continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. A key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining Danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many Danfoss colleagues. Our five global ERG themes cover Abilities — Gender, Generations, Multicultural and Nations, and Pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. Activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in STEM, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. Danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. We have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our President & CEO. The programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. Talent development Developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of Danfoss. By providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. Along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. Focus areas in 2024 People development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. We apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. We have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. Additionally, we have We firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. We strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. We have succession plans in place for all critical roles at Danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. To support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like INSEAD. To support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. In 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our INSEAD program. The Executive Transitions Program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. Members of the Group Execu- tive Team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. In 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. Our Global Mentoring Program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. In 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. We also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"The Danfoss Postgraduate Program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. In 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. Striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. Equal pay for work of equal value Equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. The basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such Danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. Our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. To prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. This is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. The total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. During the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. During the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. The gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). Our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. To prepare for the EU Pay Transparency Directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on EU countries as a starting point. Following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the EU countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. In 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. To ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and HR professionals who execute pay decisions together. Living wage At Danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. We are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. This means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. In 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all Danfoss employees receive a living wage. To date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story To enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want Danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. In 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. Psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. It creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation. In conclusion, a safe environment forms the foundation for addressing biases and fostering a growth mindset, thus leading to better performance. Engaging with our people To ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including HR- and IT-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ERGs. Focus areas in 2024 Our four Danfoss AskHR hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. We encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. Regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. To promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. Our global engagement survey, the Voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. It is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. The survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at Danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. All teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. Our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. Additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. Our work councils are organized at the local, national, and European level. The Danfoss European Works Council (DEWC) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. The DEWC consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. Meeting minutes are published on our intranet. In 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-EU countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. A few examples come from the US, where Danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and Latin America and China, where Danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities.

"Case story Case story Case story Bringing refurbished drives back to business Our Danfoss Power Electronics and Drives segment has initiated an important circularity project. The purpose of the project is to refurbish drives, aiming at 100 drives per month, giving them a second life and preventing premature scrapping. Initially, we have focused on learning, and the refurbishment of 54 drives has enabled us to better prepare for our continued plans in 2025. The Danfoss Power Electronics and Drives segment already has a strong position in helping customers decarbonize their own operations. By developing refurbishment projects, we build a position where we can help our customers decarbonize outside their operations through reduced resource consumption. Remanufacturing hydrostatic pumps to as good as new Last year, we shared the story about how pumps for sugar cane harvesters are remanufactured. This year, we have continued to invest in developing circular remanufacturing services together with selected distribution partners. Through these services, hydrostatic pumps are brought back to their original performance through genuine components and state-of-the-art techniques adhering to strict reuse guidelines. The remanufactured pumps have multiple benefits for customers: a speedy exchange at a competitive price, the known Danfoss quality, and a warranty. Repair and remanufacturing are some of the important levers for meeting both our sales decarbonization and circularity goals. Taking back thermostats In Denmark, up to 500,000 thermostats are discarded as waste every year. Danfoss Climate Solutions aims to reduce waste and increase recycling of these materials. Therefore, in 2024, we tested options for recycling thermostat materials at end of life. We invested in a take-back pilot to explore options for introducing these materials into new Danfoss products, enabling significant emissions reductions. Through customer collaboration, we established 10 collection points in Denmark. The recycled contents will go into new thermostats of the same high quality Danfoss is known for, but with significantly lower embodied emissions. 75 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"

Our aim is to provide an inspiring and inclusive work environment where people feel that they belong. Our people activities support us in attracting and retaining the best talent. With the best people, we get the best performance. The representation of women on the Board of Directors is currently 25%. Women in leadership positions is a key metric for improving gender balance in the organization and increased in 2024 to 23.7% (2023: 22.1%), the highest increase ever in the share of women in leadership roles at Danfoss. Improving the gender and nationality diversity of our global leadership teams is also one of our key focus areas. After achieving a very strong increase of 8.1%-points in Management Team Diversity from 2022 to 2023, we saw a decrease of 2.4%-points to 73.1% in 2024. However, we are still on track to meet our target of 80% for 2030. Furthermore, Danfoss is committed to maintaining a gender pay gap below 5%. In 2024, the total pay ratio globally between genders per job category decreased to 6.3% (2023: 6.9%). During 2025, we will intensify our work to minimize this gap. Safety is a priority for Danfoss, and we do not tolerate unsafe behavior and environments. We continue to address and promote health and safety internally through clear policies, continuous safety training, dialogues, and workshops as well as strong leadership role-modeling. As we expand our business, we stay committed to ensuring a healthy and safe working environment. Since 2017, we have almost doubled the size of Danfoss. In 2024, the Lost Time Injury Frequency rate (LTIF) has increased slightly from a record low 1.2 in 2023 to 1.3 in 2024. Also, our Total Recordable Injury Frequency rate (TRIF) increased slightly from 2.1 in 2023 to 2.3 in 2024. We expect to get back to 2023 levels during 2025.

"Safety First! To meet our commitments, we have established global policies where accountability for health and safety lies with our Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) leadership. Our EHS Policy and other internal policies are the backbone of how we ensure a safe and healthy workplace for our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders. EHS requirements that apply to external parties, such as contractors working at Danfoss sites, are defined in our contractor safety guidelines. Having an effective prevention and risk-based approach while driving continuous improvements, are the fundamental principles of our approach. To maintain a robust management system, and align with best practices, we require that all our production sites comply with international standards such as ISO 45001 for occupational health and safety management systems, and ISO 14001 for environmental management systems. Additionally, we comply with local statutory requirements, and all our employees are covered by our EHS management system. Our Health and Well-being Policy promotes well- being, advises on physical and mental health issues, and addresses medical incidents. At Danfoss, we acknowledge the link between employee well-being and a work environment free from harassment and discrimination1. Accountability for well-being in Danfoss lies with our leaders. To achieve our commitment, we have monitoring mechanisms in place, conduct audits, and implement preventive actions accordingly. Our key focus areas and actions taken include • Regular health and safety training for all employees. • Recurring risk assessments of machinery, materials, chemicals and workflows. • Preventive maintenance of machinery to avoid breakdowns and accidents. • An incident alert mechanism ensuring that corrective actions are addressed globally. • Global reporting of potential hazards and implementation of measures to mitigate and/or eliminate risks before such occur. We provide a range of support systems. For example, we have personnel at our sites who are trained in first aid. Furthermore, as part of our benefits program, our employees are covered by health insurance and an employee assistance program (EAP) that offers professional counselling for any work or personal issue and an online resource hub. At Danfoss, we prioritize and protect the physical and psychological safety and health of all employees, and we are committed to creating a safe work environment. We believe it is fundamental that we have an effective health and safety management system in place to sustain a culture that prioritizes safety and well-being. 1 We do not tolerate discrimination based on characteristics such as gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, cast, religion, sexual orientation, political opinion, disability, whether physical, mental, or learning, or any other characteristics protected by laws. 2 LTIF adjusted for newly acquired SEMIKRON and BOCK® Compressors is 1.1 and TRIF 2.1. Targets 2024 reflects the inclusion of both. We measure the effectiveness of our actions through our Health and Safety KPIs: LTIF (Lost Time Incidents Frequency) and TRIF (Total Recordable Incidents Frequency). Health & Safety 2023 20242 Target LTIF 1.2 1.3 1.4 TRIF 2.1 2.3 2.4 Fatalities 0 0 - Mental health We believe that promoting mental health in the workplace is crucial as it enhances employee well- being, productivity, and overall organizational success. In 2024, our actions included increasing awareness about mental health, and we introduced a stress management e-learning training for all leaders. The e-learning was piloted in Denmark and will be made available globally in 2025. While recognizing the need for global consistency, Danfoss employees are empowered to implement local initiatives, e.g., through employee resource groups (ERGs) or business segment-, country-, or site-level initiatives. To promote a workplace where everyone feels safe to speak up, share new ideas, and express themselves freely, we have launched a series of psychological safety events. The goal has been to cultivate a common understanding and provide actionable tactics for nurturing psychological safety and ensure that all voices are heard and can contribute to our joint success. 81 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story Case story Eight years without an incident in Wuqing, China We speak up for Safety At Danfoss, we say 'Safety First', and we mean it — it is one of our core focus areas to keep our people safe. In 2024, Danfoss Climate Solutions showed great results with a decrease of 20% in TRIF (total recordable incident frequency) compared to the previous year. The LTIF (lost time incident frequency) was as low as 1.6 which is the best ever recorded result for the segment showing An effective safety organization set up in Danfoss enabled eight years without any incidents at our Wuqing factory in China. The organization comprises six sub-committees: Compliance, Hazard Management, Equipment Safety, Sustainability, Ergonomics, Safety Inspec- tion, and Change. an unwavering commitment toward creating productive and safe workplaces. In May 2024, we highlighted the importance of safety with the theme of 'Spot the Hazard' during our annual safety week. Having a Safety First mindset helps us strive for zero accidents as we take action to prevent them from happening in the first place. The three main goals of the organization are a safer factory, healthier employees, and a better protected work environment. The organization generated an employee safety culture and awareness, and increased the digital management of the factory. 82 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"High-performing, diverse teams Our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. We expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. In 2024, Danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. We have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. This means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all Danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. Responsibility for our people strategy lies with our Executive Vice President, Group Human Resources. We know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. We have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. Focus areas in 2024 We continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. A key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining Danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many Danfoss colleagues. Our five global ERG themes cover Abilities — Gender, Generations, Multicultural and Nations, and Pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. Activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in STEM, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. Danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. We have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our President & CEO. The programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. Talent development Developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of Danfoss. By providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. Along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. Focus areas in 2024 People development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. We apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. We have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. Additionally, we have We firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. We strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. We have succession plans in place for all critical roles at Danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. To support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like INSEAD. To support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. In 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our INSEAD program. The Executive Transitions Program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. Members of the Group Execu- tive Team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. In 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. Our Global Mentoring Program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. In 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. We also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"

The purpose of the project is to refurbish drives, aiming at 100 drives per month, giving them a second life and preventing premature scrapping. Initially, we have focused on learning, and the refurbishment of 54 drives has enabled us to better prepare for our continued plans in 2025. The Danfoss Power Electronics and Drives segment already has a strong position in helping customers decarbonize their own operations. By developing refurbishment projects, we build a position where we can help our customers decarbonize outside their operations through reduced resource consumption. Remanufacturing hydrostatic pumps to as good as new Last year, we shared the story about how pumps for sugar cane harvesters are remanufactured. This year, we have continued to invest in developing circular remanufacturing services together with selected distribution partners. Through these services, hydrostatic pumps are brought back to their original performance through genuine components and state-of-the-art techniques adhering to strict reuse guidelines. The remanufactured pumps have multiple benefits for customers: a speedy exchange at a competitive price, the known Danfoss quality, and a warranty. Repair and remanufacturing are some of the important levers for meeting both our sales decarbonization and circularity goals. Taking back thermostats In Denmark, up to 500,000 thermostats are discarded as waste every year. Danfoss Climate Solutions aims to reduce waste and increase recycling of these materials. Therefore, in 2024, we tested options for recycling thermostat materials at end of life. We invested in a take-back pilot to explore options for introducing these materials into new Danfoss products, enabling significant emissions reductions. Through customer collaboration, we established 10 collection points in Denmark. The recycled contents will go into new thermostats of the same high quality Danfoss is known for, but with significantly lower embodied emissions. 75 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"

"Targets Progress Circularity As raw materials become increasingly scarce and more costly to extract, keeping resources in circulation is crucial. Where resources are kept in circulation, waste and pollution are reduced. At Danfoss, our circularity ambition addresses our existing product portfolio and our new product development. Improvements to the existing port folio are achieved with after-sales services and new business opportunities such as take-back, remanufacturing, and refurbishment, which all contribute to the circular economy. Design of new products that contribute to the circular economy entails using fewer or more circular raw materials, applying low-carbon production processes, and designing for reuse, repair, and recycling. At Danfoss, we engineer products and solutions that enable us and our customers to do more with less. We invest in circularity to be responsible for our own environmental impact and to maintain, and improve, our competitiveness. To engineer the products for tomorrow, circularity must be an integrated part of the innovation cycle from the beginning. As of 2023, we have mapped and monitor our circular business revenue streams which are revenues from: • refurbished/remanufactured products, systems, or elements resold • repair and maintenance activities to prolong the lifetime of our products, upgrade activities • the sale of spare parts • performance and access-based models (e.g., sharing or leasing products and services) • digital services aiming to prolong the products’ lifetime In 2024, our circular business revenues increased by 5%. of all new product developments initiated in 2024 were covered by Danfoss’ circularity approach. increase in 2024, equal to EUR 19m, compared to 2023 baseline. 80% 25% of newly developed products launched to be covered by Danfoss’ circularity approach by 2030. 25% 5% increase in circular business revenues by 2030 compared to our 2023 baseline, equal to EUR 361m. 73 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Environment"

Each principle is operationalized through 10 strategies that guide our existing product portfolio and new product development. These strategies are the foundation for designing products for circularity. Embedding circularity in new product development Our Danfoss Circularity Framework, Sustainable Design Guide, and toolbox support our product development and teams in making decisions and improving the design of new products. Design decisions made during the early design stages significantly influence a product’s sustainability and circularity performance over the product lifecycle many years into the future. These decisions include selection of material, assembly method, and expected lifespan. Key actions in 2024 We rolled out the circularity toolbox across Danfoss. Using our RE:CIRC, circularity index, and carbon footprint tools, our innovation teams apply the 10 sustainable design strategies from the Danfoss Circularity Framework to support the innovation process. In the first year of implementation, 25% of new product development projects have undergone a sustainability assessment and shown improvement on one or more of the circularity or sustainability aspects. Addressing our existing product portfolio: circular services and solutions We have set an ambition on circularity for our existing products and services, with a target to increase our circular business revenue by 25% in 2030 (base year: 2023).

"Case story Case story Eight years without an incident in Wuqing, China We speak up for Safety At Danfoss, we say 'Safety First', and we mean it — it is one of our core focus areas to keep our people safe. In 2024, Danfoss Climate Solutions showed great results with a decrease of 20% in TRIF (total recordable incident frequency) compared to the previous year. The LTIF (lost time incident frequency) was as low as 1.6 which is the best ever recorded result for the segment showing An effective safety organization set up in Danfoss enabled eight years without any incidents at our Wuqing factory in China. The organization comprises six sub-committees: Compliance, Hazard Management, Equipment Safety, Sustainability, Ergonomics, Safety Inspec- tion, and Change. an unwavering commitment toward creating productive and safe workplaces. In May 2024, we highlighted the importance of safety with the theme of 'Spot the Hazard' during our annual safety week. Having a Safety First mindset helps us strive for zero accidents as we take action to prevent them from happening in the first place. The three main goals of the organization are a safer factory, healthier employees, and a better protected work environment. The organization generated an employee safety culture and awareness, and increased the digital management of the factory. 82 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"High-performing, diverse teams Our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. We expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. In 2024, Danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. We have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. This means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all Danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. Responsibility for our people strategy lies with our Executive Vice President, Group Human Resources. We know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. We have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. Focus areas in 2024 We continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. A key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining Danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many Danfoss colleagues. Our five global ERG themes cover Abilities — Gender, Generations, Multicultural and Nations, and Pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. Activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in STEM, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. Danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. We have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our President & CEO. The programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. Talent development Developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of Danfoss. By providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. Along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. Focus areas in 2024 People development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. We apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. We have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. Additionally, we have We firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. We strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. We have succession plans in place for all critical roles at Danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. To support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like INSEAD. To support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. In 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our INSEAD program. The Executive Transitions Program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. Members of the Group Execu- tive Team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. In 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. Our Global Mentoring Program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. In 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. We also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"The Danfoss Postgraduate Program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. In 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. Striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. Equal pay for work of equal value Equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. The basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such Danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. Our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. To prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. This is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. The total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. During the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the EU Pay Transparency Directive. Consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. During the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. The gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). Our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. To prepare for the EU Pay Transparency Directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on EU countries as a starting point. Following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the EU countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. In 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. To ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and HR professionals who execute pay decisions together. Living wage At Danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. We are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. This means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. In 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all Danfoss employees receive a living wage. To date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. In 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Social"
"Case story To enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want Danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. In 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. Psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. It creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation. In conclusion, a safe environment forms the foundation for addressing biases and fostering a growth mindset, thus leading to better performance. Engaging with our people To ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including HR- and IT-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ERGs. Focus areas in 2024 Our four Danfoss AskHR hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. We encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. Regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. To promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. Our global engagement survey, the Voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. It is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. The survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at Danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. All teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. Our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. Additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. Our work councils are organized at the local, national, and European level. The Danfoss European Works Council (DEWC) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. The DEWC consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. Meeting minutes are published on our intranet. In 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-EU countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. A few examples come from the US, where Danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and Latin America and China, where Danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities.

"Accounting policies to the consolidated ESG statement Reporting period Unless otherwise stated, the consolidated ESG statement cover the period from January 1 to December 31, 2024. Environment Climate Primary data on scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions constitutes the largest proportion of emissions data. This includes data from digital and manual meter readings and consumption data from invoices. Locations with primary data cover Danfoss factories, currently approximately 2.2 million m2 out of Danfoss’ total real estate footprint of 2.5 million m2, corresponding to 87%. For the remaining part of Danfoss locations where no consumption and emissions data are available, average consumption values per m2 have been applied to estimate energy consumption and GHG emissions. For 2024, this amounted to 4% of total scope 1 and 2 emissions (market-based). If available, calculations of GHG emissions are based on emission factors from invoices from energy suppliers. Otherwise, the most recent available emission factors from IEA are applied. All GHG emissions are converted to CO2 equivalents (CO2e). Scope 1 GHG emissions Scope 1 GHG emissions include direct emissions from combustion of gas and oil, fugitive emissions and mileage in Danfoss-owned or -controlled vehicles. Scope 2 GHG emissions (market-based) Scope 2 GHG emissions include indirect emissions from purchased heating and electricity. Market-based emissions factors were applied, which implies that power purchase agreements (PPAs) of green energy and other renewable sourcing of energy influences the calculation. Where no market-based emissions factors are available, location-based emissions factors from IEA were applied. For 2024 emissions, 2023 factors were applied as the new factors were not available at the time of publishing this report. Scope 2 GHG emissions (location-based) Scope 2 GHG emissions include indirect emissions from purchased heating and electricity. Location-based emissions factors from IEA have been applied. For 2024 emissions, 2023 factors were applied as the new factors were not available at the time of publishing this report. Scope 3 GHG emissions During 2024, Danfoss worked intensely with improving calculation methodology and data completeness related the material categories within our scope 3 reporting, which are C1, C4, C9, and C11. This work has been coordinated across our three segments. The applied emissions factors for energy and fuel consumption are from IEA, DEFRA 2024, and suppliers. The materials emissions factors used are from the Sphera database. Transportation emissions are calculated using suppliers’ emissions reports. 2022 2023 2024 Scope 1 GHG emissions (tCO2e) Total Danfoss excluding recent acquisitions 80,565 43,973 43,972 Eaton’s hydraulics business 30,122 27,001 22,898 Semikron Danfoss - 93,491 63,617 BOCK® Compressors - - 255 Total 110,687 164,465 130,742 2022 2023 2024 Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions (tCO2e) Total Danfoss excluding recent acquisitions 159,967 150,480 104,532 Eaton's hydraulics business 124,950 104,807 100,262 Semikron Danfoss - 6,935 9,451 BOCK® Compressors - - 1,757 Total 284,917 262,222 216,002 102 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Appendix"
"Scope 3 GHG emissions include indirect emissions from the following categories (C): • C1 Purchased goods and services: covers direct and indirect spend on materials. The direct spend calculation uses a combination of average-data method and the hybrid method together with emission factors from the GaBi tool. For indirect spend, we use the spend-based method and apply emission factors from the Danish Klimakompasset. • C2 Capital goods: includes acquisition of machines and real estate based on the average spend-based method multiplied by emissions factors from the Danish Klimakompasset. • C3 Fuel- and energy-related activities: covers emissions from energy not already included in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions based on average country emissions factors from IEA. • C4 Upstream transportation and distribution: covers intercompany flows, supplier and customer flows paid by Danfoss, 3PL warehouses, and supplier flows not paid by Danfoss. Calculation is based on supplier emissions reports, where available, combined with spend-based calculation of remaining volume. • C5 Waste generated in operations: includes emissions from total waste within each waste category going into each disposal method multiplied by emission factors from IEA. • C6 Business travel: based on total number of flights grouped into short-haul (<3,700km) and long-haul (>3,700km) multiplied by DEFRA emission factors from 2024. • C7 Employee commuting: calculation method based on average commuting data combined with mode of transportation. • C8 Upstream leased assets: includes emissions from leased locations, mainly Danfoss sales office locations not already included in scope 1 and 2. • C9 Downstream transportation and distribution: covers customer flows not paid by Danfoss. Calculation based on incoterms and volume per transportation mode. • C11 Use of sold products: covers the use-phase emissions from sold products in the reporting year over their expected lifetime. Lifetime power consumption is converted into emissions using global IEA CO2e emissions per kWh. To the extent that Danfoss can determine the country or region the product is used, we apply country or regional emissions factors for that volume of sold products. GHG intensity — GHG emissions (location-based) GHG intensity is reported as total GHG emissions (location-based) in metric tons per EURm net sales. GHG intensity — GHG emissions (market-based) GHG intensity is reported as total GHG emissions (market-based) in metric tons per EURm net sales. • C12 End-of-life treatment of sold products: reported as emissions from disposal or treatment of materials reported in C1 Purchased goods and services. • C13 Downstream leased assets: covers two passenger airplanes owned by Danfoss A/S and leased by the local airline company. 2022 2023 2024 Scope 3 GHG emissions (tCO2e) Total Danfoss excluding recent acquisitions 83,405,239 84,507,868 94,105,070 Eaton's hydraulics business 1,145,232 1,012,119 682,717 Semikron Danfoss - 41,969,451 25,113,923 BOCK® Compressors - - 3,991,625 Total 84,550,471 127,489,438 123,893,335 103 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Appendix"

"Business conduct The basis of our business culture is defined in our global Business Conduct Policy and the Danfoss Ethics Handbook. The handbook is based on the Danfoss Values as well as principles from international conventions and guidelines supporting sustainable development, such as UN Global Compact, UN Guiding Principles, and ILO’s core conventions on labor rights. Our guidelines on business conduct help our employees live up to our values and policies. The guidelines are available in multiple languages and cover topics such as corruption and bribery, fraud, discrimination, human rights, donations, fair competition, and conflicts of interest. All employees are expected to follow the Danfoss Ethics Handbook as it is part of our employee agreements and regular mandatory training. To develop, promote, and evaluate our corporate culture, Danfoss has established a comprehensive compliance program. The program includes annual compliance training on the topics of ethics, export control, fair competition, anti-corruption, and data privacy. The program is mandatory for all employees considered to be in a position of higher risk in relation to these topics or at a director level or above. To promote responsible business conduct, a continual focus on ethical issues and topics forms part of our approach. The Danfoss Board of Directors is responsible for oversight on ethics and compliance, and the Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the compliance program. Responsibility for day-to-day ethics and compliance activities is anchored with the respective business segments and functions. Compliance risks relating to business conduct are regularly monitored via our Enterprise Risk Management. Prevention and detection of bribery and corruption At Danfoss, we have a zero-tolerance policy for bribery and corruption. To prevent unethical and illegal practices, our compliance program covers ethics and corruption risk assessments, continuous risk monitoring, and it enables implementation of Acting responsibly has been a part of Danfoss’ core values since our foundation and is instrumental in our ability to build leading positions across multiple industries and global locations. mitigating measures. Additionally, the program includes mandatory training to promote awareness and knowledge building on topics such as bribery, kickbacks, facilitation payments, nepotism, and conflict of interest. Such training is mandatory for all at-risk functions, such as our sales, procurement, finance, supply chain and operations, and public affairs functions. To ensure the effectiveness of our training and our compliance approach, we periodically review all trainings and compliance procedures. We actively encourage and support our employees to report through the Ethics Hotline any concerns or observations of actual or potential policy violations regarding bribery and corruption. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee receives updates on the number, nature, impact, and outcome of the reported cases. Whistleblower function To maintain a culture that reflects our values and ethical business practices, we promote a speak-up culture where concerns can be trusted to be handled confidentially and without fear of retaliation. The Danfoss Ethics Hotline, which is hosted by an external operator, serves as our whistleblower function and a grievance mechanism for human rights. The platform ensures full compliance with EU GDPR, worldwide data protection regulations, and regulatory requirements regarding whistleblower protection as set out in the EU Whistleblowing Directive. The hotline is publicly available, accessible through the Danfoss website, and available in many languages for worldwide use. The hotline not only allows Danfoss employees to raise concerns and grievances but also provides suppliers, customers, workers in the value chain, and other third parties to have a formal channel for raising concerns. 90 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Governance"
"To protect against retaliation, the Danfoss Ethics Hotline enables case reporters to maintain their anonymity by offering a secure and unique mailbox. This allows the case investigator to maintain contact with the case reporter and provide case updates to the reporting party. To ensure that reports are investigated independently and impartially, case investigators are separate from the chain of management involved in the identified matters. When a case is reported, the central Ethics Hotline function generally handles all case investigations, involving trusted local or global experts as needed unless local legislation requires case handling by local management teams. All cases are overseen by the Ethics Committee to ensure the consistent and ethical handling of cases throughout the organization. To promote the use of the Ethics Hotline, the Danfoss Ethics Handbook provides guidance on how to report concerns through the Danfoss Ethics Hotline. This year we saw an increase in substantiated cases. This is due to a change in our processes to fully capture all cases through the Danfoss Ethics Hotline from 2024, and our efforts to reduce barriers to reporting concerns. Therefore, this development is in line with our expectations and below the industry benchmark.1 In 2024, we received 382 whistleblower reports, of which 135 could be substantiated. For all substantiated cases, corrective actions, ranging from addressing inappropriate behavior to termination of employment, were implemented during the year. Since 2004, we have tracked employee terminations due to unethical or illegal behavior. In 2024, 50 employees left Danfoss due to unethical behavior compared to 74 in 2023 and 32 in 2022. to transparency, integrity, and accountability. The Danfoss Group Tax Policy, which applies to all Danfoss operations, is reviewed on an annual basis by the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Committee. The Chair of the Audit Committee is responsible within the Board of Directors for oversight of the Group's tax policy. Operational tax matters, including monitoring and management of tax risks, are reported to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. The policy is implemented throughout our businesses. Our global tax organization is responsible for ensuring compliance with tax obligations in the countries where we operate. They are also responsible for implementing responsible tax practices as defined by the Danfoss Tax Policy, following the spirit and intent of local and international law in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct. Read more about our approach to tax governance in the Danfoss Tax Report 2024 Data privacy and data ethics Following our digital transformation, processes in Danfoss have become increasingly digitalized. This entails gathering, storage, analysis, and use of vast quantities of both personal and non-personal data. Danfoss applies the same ethical values and guidelines to the processing of all data across the organization, going beyond compliance with data privacy legislation. We maintain a high focus on data privacy processes and compliance with data privacy regulations. 2024 Ethics and Human Rights Whistleblower cases, total 382 Substantiated cases, total 135 Of the substantiated cases, the following cases relate to: Discrimination incl. harassment 31 – Resulting in fines of EURm 0 Severe human rights issues and incidents 0 – Resulting in fines of EURm 0 Number of convictions of violation of anti-corruption and bribery laws 0 – Resulting in fines of EURm 0 Responsible tax practices As part of our commitment to conduct business in a lawful and ethical manner, we are committed to also engaging in responsible tax practices. At Danfoss, we believe that tax payments and contributions play an important role in contributing to the welfare and development of society. As such, we are not driven by tax planning initiatives and believe in creating a fair profit allocation and acting in accordance with all applicable international and national tax rules and tax reporting. The Danfoss Tax Policy, which defines our approach to responsible tax practices, describes our commitment 1 Navex benchmark, for companies with 10,000 - 50,000 employees Based on the regularly updated Danfoss Binding Corporate Rules, approved by the Danish data protection authorities, we adhere to our Data Privacy Handbook, conduct training, and comply with data privacy legislation where we operate. Data exploration and data modeling help us better understand stakeholder needs and insights to improve our services, reduce risks, and improve operational processes. At the same time, we refrain from large-scale collection of data, which may be characterized as data-driven surveillance, and we respect the right to data privacy for our employees, business partners, and the people using our products. We have additional security measures in place to protect personal data that is also not monetized. When applying artificial intelligence (AI) or automated decision-making, we base the system selection, data quality assurance, and data collection framework definitions on human decisions. Danfoss ensures that stakeholders are informed in line with our legal obligations regarding personal data. Special personal data that reveals racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, or data concerning health or revealing a person’s sexual activity or orientation will in no event be subject to AI or automated decision-making. The only exceptions are when individuals have provided their explicit consent or the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest or applicable law. 91 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Governance"
"Responsible supplier management A stable, sustainable, and transparent supply chain is essential for Danfoss to do business and deliver on our commitment to being the preferred decarbonization partner for our customers. Across our three segments, we work to continuously mitigate supply chain risks and realize opportunities for strategic and value-adding relationships with our suppliers. Responsibility for our supply chain management lies with our segment and divisional management teams. The Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct All suppliers are required to comply with the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct, which establishes specific environmental, social, and ethical business requirements for our suppliers. These requirements are based on the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and other relevant conventions of the International Labor Organization (ILO). While the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct applies to our suppliers, its intent is expected to be reflected at our sub-suppliers. To achieve this, we acknowledge that we can support and work with our suppliers to address sustainability topics that are relevant to our suppliers and sub-suppliers. Supplier selection and onboarding It is crucial that our suppliers share our sustainability commitments as it requires joint efforts to ensure responsible business practices. In Danfoss, we believe that responsible supplier management goes hand in hand with trust, transparency, and sustainability. As part of our screening and selection process, we require that all potential new suppliers complete a Supplier Qualification Audit and commit to the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct. We support our suppliers through ongoing dialogues and engagements on topics covered by the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct. As part of screening, suppliers based in countries identified as high-risk are audited by a third party. As such, we ensure that environmental, social, and ethical business practices are considered by the Danfoss Sourcing Committee in the supplier selection process. As of 2024, 69% of our suppliers in high-risk countries have additional contractual clauses on environmental, labor, and human rights requirements. Risk mitigation and remediation Once onboarded, suppliers are audited through our supplier auditing risk-based approach, taking into account country risks indices. Through this risk-based approach, we can focus our efforts and third-party audits on suppliers located in high-risk countries where the risks and negative impacts to people and the environment are greater. In total, 74% of our suppliers in high-risk countries have gone through a third-party on-site audit. During the year, 76 third-party audits were performed in high-risk countries, and 12 severe non-conformities were identified relating to working hours, lack of safety exits, and a lack of emergency lighting. All non-conformities are addressed through a root-cause analysis to identify corrective actions. While suppliers work to address the non-conformities, action plans are followed up until the non-conformity can be closed. Overall, around 400 suppliers were engaged in corrective actions or capacity building after assessments in 2024. Updating our supplier requirements Ownership of procurement organizations is anchored with our segment leadership teams. An important part of our approach to responsible supplier management is to monitor developments in international standards and sustainability best practices and make sure these are reflected in our ways of working with our suppliers. For this reason, we initiated in 2024 a review of the Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct to our requirements. This review was aligned with the standards of the Responsible Business Alliance. Once we update and incorporate the learnings both from our review our supplier engagement program, we aim to roll out our updated Danfoss Supplier Code of Conduct in 2025. Decarbonizing with our suppliers To deliver on our climate targets and decarbonization roadmaps and to meet increasing customer data needs, we implemented a supplier engagement program, the ‘Green Ask’ initiative, in 2024. Since starting the initiative, we have continuously worked to improve and embed additional elements into its scope, e.g., recycled materials and environmental impact requirements, and we plan to expand the scope even further. To enable adoption of this initiative, we have also developed and deployed training and guidance for our colleagues and participating suppliers. 92 / 185 Danfoss Annual Report 2024 > Sustainability statement > Governance"
