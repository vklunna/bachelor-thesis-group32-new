"The Group has also issued two sustainability-linked bonds indexed to a December 2025 carbon footprint target, for 700 million euros in July 2021 and 750 million euros in November 2022. These two issues underline Valeo’s commitment to carbon neutrality. The characteristics of these financing arrangements are presented in Chapter 5, section 5.4.6 “Notes to the consolidated financial statements”, Notes 1.3.6 “Financing”, page 364, and 9.1.2.1 “Long-term debt”, page 402. Assessment of potential locked-in GHG emissions Following a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the potential locked-in GHG emissions of its main assets and products, Valeo has concluded that the level of these emissions does not jeopardize the achievement of its reduction targets. Objective or plan for aligning Taxonomy-eligible economic activities The share of the Group’s 2024 turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx) related to Taxonomy- eligible economic activities under the six objectives of Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation, are detailed in section 4.2.2.5 “Taxonomy KPI tables”, page 212. Integration of the transition plan into financial strategy and planning Since 2020, the Sustainable Development and External Affairs Department has also been in charge of the governance structure established for the launch, implementation and monitoring of Valeo’s Carbon Neutrality Contribution Plan for 2050. This steering committee brings together all the aforementioned departments and networks under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer. Its aim is to set annual objectives for the various contributing networks and to oversee the implementation of Valeo’s Carbon Neutrality Contribution Plan. To monitor the plan, Valeo has set annualized greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives, backed by action plans for the internal networks contributing to them. The achievement of these objectives is presented to the General Management at quarterly reviews, and since 2021 has been one of the criteria for the variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and more than 1,700 senior executives. Approval of the transition plan by governance The Board of Directors is the Group’s highest governance body in charge of the CAP 50 Plan and has delegated responsibility for its implementation and monitoring to the Governance, Appointments & Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (see section 4.1.2.1 “Composition of the Board of Directors and objectives”, page 191). Results of the implementation of the transition plan The targets and results achieved in 2024 are presented in section 4.2.3.8 “Energy consumption”, page 233 and 4.2.3.9 “Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions within the framework of the Carbon Neutrality Contribution Plan for 2050”, page 234.

Upstream Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions The 2030 upstream Scope 3 emission reduction target is 1,400 ktCO2eq. compared with the 2019 baseline. Depending on the change in Group sales between now and 2030 and the distribution of Product Lines in the Valeo sales portfolio, this amount could more than double. The decarbonization levers identified for upstream Scope 3 are described below. The reservoirs of validated actions to be implemented cover 90% of upstream Scope 3 GHG emission reductions, and are monitored during quarterly CAP 50 committees. Thanks to the use of low-carbon materials (recycled, biosourced, etc.) and improvements in the energy efficiency of Valeo's suppliers, reductions of up to 3 MtCO2eq. have been identified. Valeo will also benefit from the decarbonization of its value chain, particularly the supply of electronic components, which could contribute to the reduction of over a million additional metric tons of CO2.

"EMISSIONS AVOIDED THANKS TO VALEO TECHNOLOGIES (MtCO2) 0.0 7.4 13.6 2019 2025 2030 Definition and scope of emissions avoided Avoided emissions are defined as the GHG emission reductions achieved when Valeo products replace more polluting internal combustion engines (ICE). Valeo’s initial focus was on vehicle electrification, but it plans to extend the scope to all product categories. Guiding principles Relevance and accuracy: The Group ensures that emission reductions are clearly linked to its products, based on reliable and well-documented data. Transparency: The Group provides clear and comprehensive information on all underlying assumptions and methodologies. Prudence: The Group uses conservative estimates to avoid overestimating environmental benefits. Methodological steps Definition of the baseline: The automotive industry’s transition from nearly 100% internal combustion engines (ICE) to battery electric vehicles (BEV) is modeled over a 15-year period (2019-2035 in the EU27). Each BEV is assumed to replace an ICE vehicle. As vehicles have an average life of more than 16 years, no replacements are assumed during this transition period. Impact assessment Avoided emissions are calculated by comparing the well-to- wheel emissions of an average Class C ICE vehicle with those of a Class C BEV. The comparison uses the IEA sustainable development scenario for the average CO2 content of electricity worldwide. Lifetime emissions are based on CO2 intensity at the time of the vehicle’s sale. [ESRS E1-3 § AR30] Climate change mitigation actions, decarbonization levers, key actions and their contributions to achieving GHG emission reduction targets, broken down by Scopes 1, 2 & 3, as well as the role of new technologies in achieving the targets are detailed in section 4.2.3.4 “CAP 50: Transition plan for climate change mitigation”, page 223. The Group’s climate scenarios are described in section 4.2.3.3.1 “Analysis of physical and transition risks”, page 219. The table below shows the Group’s progress from 2019 to 2024 in terms of its emissions reduction trajectory.

"Impacts, risks and opportunities were assessed during workshops organized jointly by the Risk Management Department and the Sustainable Development Department, as described in section 4.1.3.3, “Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model”, page 200. During these workshops, internal contributors identified and assessed impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) according to the methodology described in section 4.1.4.1 “Processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities”, page 201. As Valeo has not identified any affected population within the scope of its activities, the Group has not carried out stakeholder consultations with specific communities. [ESRS 2 MDR – A§69] Initiatives related to IROs of the ESRS E2 topical standards are often integrated into broader action plans. However, Valeo does not always have the data granularity required to track current and future resources allocated to each action (BP 2). 4.2.4.2 Policies related to pollution (DR E2-1) [ESRS E2-1 § 12 à 15] Some of Valeo’s activities use chemical substances that may be harmful to the environment, biodiversity and human health, and generate hazardous waste. They generate effluents that may contain such substances as oil, heavy metals or suspended solids. The risk to the Group arises from the failure to control the use of certain substances, the polluting nature of the resulting discharges and effluents, and the management of its hazardous waste. The Group must be exemplary in its management of chemical substances at each stage of their use cycle in order to avoid any risk of pollution of the natural environment. Each site must ensure, through regulatory monitoring, that its processes and the substances it uses always comply with local environmental regulations Each site must also prevent the risk of pollution resulting from an industrial accident. The main causes to be averted are: • non-compliance of discharges; • aging of internal processing equipment; • the absence of treatment stations on site or externally; • poorly managed waste treatment channels; • the tightening of regulations in force. The risk may also be aggravated by late detection of discharges into the environment due to a lack or absence of: • periodic checks of storage facilities; • periodic checks of the discharge treatment process; • intervention and control policy in respect of environmental accidents. • a firewater retention area. To prevent the risk of pollution across all sites, the Group has adopted several operational environmental directives setting rules for all sites, on the following issues: • effluents; • intervention means and consequence limitations; • the management of underground tanks; • waste management; • soil and groundwater management. All pollution risks are addressed by the Group’s environmental policy (see section 4.2.1 “Environmental policies and commitments”, page 205), which describes the standards and ISO 14001 reference framework on which it is based and includes the following subjects: Pollution of air Valeo’s activities are liable to generate emissions into air that could affect the environment and human health. Such emissions must be tightly controlled and monitored to avoid any risk of pollution. The Group aims to limit the level of risk at each site through the following measures: • maintaining an up-to-date inventory of its emissions into air; • reducing chemical emissions into air; • controlling personal exposure limits; • implementing a monitoring plan for its regulated emissions. Each site must establish a system to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements on emissions into air. In addition to complying with local regulations, the Group’s guidelines require that the best available solutions be shared across all sites. Each site establishes an inventory of its emissions as follows: • listing the sources of emissions into air, taking all of the site’s processes and activities into consideration; • listing facilities for the treatment of these emissions; • describing emissions based on their origin (emissions from combustion plants or production processes); • quantifying emissions in order to determine whether operating permits need to be obtained in accordance with applicable regulations. Each Valeo site assesses, particularly whenever any production processes are changed, potential ways of reducing atmospheric emissions of pollutants at source, focusing primarily on processes that do not require the installation of emission treatment facilities. The Group monitors atmospheric emissions related to its activities and recommends a calculation method for indicators of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), refrigerant gases and heavy metals such as lead (Pb). The monitoring of emissions related to combustion (sulfur oxide (SOx), COVNM, PM10) is not applicable, as equipment mainly uses natural gas, which emits very little of these elements during combustion. Valeo applies the policy to all its plants and R&D centers. The HSE department is responsible for its implementation. To monitor the effectiveness of its policy, Valeo collects the quantities emitted each year using a reporting tool based on the sites’ declarations. These data are evaluated by internal and external audits in accordance with Group guidelines and local regulations. In addition, sites are subject to regular management system audits. This policy complements the Group’s policies and standards, local, national and international regulations, the monitoring of operating bylaws and specific air emission limitations in the plant’s operating permit.

"4.2.4.3 Actions and resources related to pollution (DR E2-2) [ESRS E2 § 19] Pollution of air As part of its air pollution control policy, Valeo took the following key actions in 2024 at all plants and R&D centers to prevent and/or reduce pollution risks: • volatile organic compounds (VOCs): improvement of reporting processes through systematic consideration of inputs through the production management system. Valeo is committed to reducing VOCs through the use of purification systems, such as dry filters or chemical processes. Incineration is no longer preferred, in order to reduce CO2 emissions; • refrigerants: improvement of data reliability; • lead emissions: Valeo continues its work to eradicate lead. Today, the use of lead is limited to soldering flux in end-of-life products. To reduce inputs (avoidance), this type of welding is no longer authorized for new projects. Valeo has observed the following results of these actions: • emissions of combustion pollutants: based on the list defined in Annex II of the IEPR, only nitrogen dioxide (NOx) exceeds reporting thresholds. Other pollutants have also been quantified and are below the relevant thresholds. In the short term, the following actions are planned for all industrial sites and R&D centers: • VOCs: • installation of purification systems that go beyond the requirements of national and local regulations. The Group aims to make VOC-free products the norm where this is compatible with achieving quality objectives; • improvement of calculation methodologies; • refrigerants: • in 2025, the Group intends to change the method used to calculate its refrigerant emissions in order to reflect actual GHG emissions by moving from estimates to physical data (declaration of refrigerant charge volumes); • quantification of investments required to replace the most polluting gases and their implementation; • combustion: • identification of investments in line with the CAP 50 plan to move away from fossil fuel-based energy sources or towards less polluting fuels (e.g., substituting of heavy oil with natural gas).

"4.2.5.3 Actions and resources related to water (DR E3-2) Sustainable water management: recommendations for industrial and domestic sites The Group aims to control and minimize water consumption at its sites as much as possible, by leveraging appropriate human and material resources in line with its policy: • control and reduce leakage attributable to aging equipment and pipes; • control water supply and distribution networks with isolation systems, backflow preventers and meters, differentiated by: • domestic use (if separate from drinking water); • industrial uses, • use for firefighting; • drinking water. For drinking water, the site must, where possible, be supplied externally (public mains network preferably), and water networks must be protected from the risk of contamination by other networks. To minimize water consumption, sites are urged to take action on both their industrial and domestic consumption: • increasing the frequency of water consumption readings from quarterly to monthly; • identifying the respective needs in regard to each of the main uses of water; • optimizing consumption by integrating water saving aspects that can be factored into the purchasing decision for new equipment; • optimizing washing operations by switching to closed-loop equipment with water treatment and reuse; • setting up recycling systems such as recovering discharge water from cooling towers; • recovering condensate water from closed circuits; • reusing water from washing floors and equipment; • replacing evaporative aerothermal cooling towers with adiabatic towers or air-cooled cooling towers; • reducing domestic water consumption by reducing pressure, installing sensor taps, recycling shower water for use in toilets, installing dual flush toilets, and collecting rainwater. Sustainable water management: measures taken to address the risks of water restrictions, shortages and cuts Prior to the purchase or lease of land or buildings, the Group requires that an environmental risk assessment be carried out in order to determine, among other things, the level of water stress of future site locations. To mitigate the effects of periods of water stress, initiatives have been undertaken to optimize water consumption and withdrawal, to equip sites with reservoirs to prepare for periods of water stress, and to secure processes and fire protection for buildings. Sustainable water management: status and progress of water management programs The main actions of the water management program implemented are as follows: • Shenzhen: Switch to air-cooled towers and deployment of sub-meters to control on-site water consumption; • Penang: Finalization of the installation of sensors for detailed consumption analysis; • Guangzhou: Switch to air-cooled towers; • Chonburi: Rainwater collection study underway; • Rio, Ben Arous, Enfidha, Juarez, Cairo: Domestic water measures; • Sanand: Repair of the wastewater treatment plant; • Chennai: Construction of a wastewater treatment plant; • Mondovi, Shenyang, Nanjing Daegu 1: Renovation of the water supply network; • Amiens: Replacement of the open-water cooling tower with an adiabatic cooler; • Campinas: Installation of 30 sub-meters; • Étaples: Cooling tower ventilation control based on outside temperature to reduce evaporation; • Étaples, Campinas: Atmospheric breakers. Overall, the use of closed-loop mold cooling is becoming more widespread across the Group (67% of sites in 2024).

During these workshops, internal contributors identified and assessed impacts, risks and opportunities (IROs) according to the methodology described in section 4.1.4.1 “Processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities”, page 201. [ESRS 2 MDR – A§69] Initiatives related to IROs of the ESRS E3 topical standards are often integrated into broader action plans. However, Valeo does not always have the data granularity required to track current and future resources allocated to each action (BP 2). Based on an analysis conducted in 2021 with an external consultant, the list of sites exposed to the risk of water stress, or even to risks of water restrictions, water shortages or water cuts by 2030, 2040 and 2050 has been updated. It is based on two IPCC global warming scenarios, SSP2 4.5 and SSP5 8.5, reasonably optimistic and reasonably pessimistic respectively (see section 4.2.3.3.1 “Analysis of physical and transition risks”, paragraph “Physical risks – Analysis methodology”, page 219). Given the importance of this resource, the Group aims to limit withdrawals, control its water consumption, and ensure the supply of good quality water for its staff. Due to their geographic location, some Valeo sites may be exposed to water cuts or restrictions resulting from: • a municipal/regional decision in the event of a drought; • a shortage of water sources supplying the site (public network, groundwater); • poor water quality (wells, groundwater); • a restriction imposed by local authorities in the event of overconsumption; • the lack of a water recovery system; • the absence of internal treatment and recycling; • the absence of a closed-loop water circuit. The main water-related risk factors are coastal flooding, river flooding and water stress. Data are from Aqueduct (WRI(1)), from JBA), with a resolution of less than 1 km, and demand and supply are assessed using the IIASA(2) Water Futures and Solutions (WFaS) and ISIMIP(3) models. In addition, all existing and newly acquired Valeo sites are subject to analysis by a specialized external firm. This water-related due diligence covers the following risk metrics: wastewater discharge, impact on soil and groundwater, site location and surrounding land use, site utilities (including water supply and network, wastewater discharge and treatment, rainwater discharge and drainage, fire protection facilities and water supply), hydrology and hydrogeology (including surface watercourses closest to the site, national water quality standard and shallow groundwater). Each year, Valeo assesses its suppliers’ sustainability practices through a self-assessment questionnaire that includes a section on water management (see section 4.4.4 “Responsible purchasing”, page 293). [ESRS E3 § 8] Due to the location of the Group’s sites and the nature of its activities, water consumption and discharges have not impacted local communities to date. 4.2.5.2 Policies related to water (DR E3-1) The risk of water stress is increasing in many geographic areas relative to the local capacity to renew water reserves due to: • changes in global water demand (particularly in the United States, China and India); • the effects of global warming. Under the impetus of the Group Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Director, Valeo applies the following water management policy to all its activities, sites, employees and subcontractors: • performance of an environmental risk assessment before any acquisition or leasing of land or buildings, notably to determine the potential level of water stress of the future site locations; • preparation of a water supply and distribution network plan, identifying its isolation systems, backflow preventers and meters, distinguishing between domestic and industrial uses and uses for firefighting and drinking water. With regard to drinking water, the site must, where possible, be supplied from an external source (preferably the public network) and be protected against the risk of contamination by other networks; • encouragement of the use of non-drinking water wherever possible (toilets, irrigation, cleaning, firefighting, etc.); • installation of systems for determining the volume of water consumed by use (domestic, industrial, firefighting) for each water supply source; • completion of water cycle studies to fine-tune the identification of water losses related to processes, evaporation or water leaks in pipes; • work to prevent leaks attributable to aging equipment; • development of on-site water treatment processes to recover and reuse water internally; • rainwater collection. However, events such as local restrictions due to heat waves, scarcity of water sources or poor water quality can affect access to water resources, which is why it is so important for many of the Group’s sites to reduce not only their consumption but also the absolute amount of water they withdraw. The Valeo 4R circular economy program designs products and services to minimize water consumption and to treat and recycle industrial water internally.

Through the quarterly sharing of best practices, on-site water treatment and reuse solutions are promoted and adopted. The overall water withdrawal intensity ratio decreased by 18% to 121 cu.m./million euros in 2024. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental information UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT VALEO 2024 247"

"Methodological details and definitions of metrics The amount of water consumed is determined by the amount of water withdrawn and the amount of water discharged, with or without treatment, in accordance with the expectations of ESRS E3-4. Water withdrawals include water from the public supply network, groundwater, surface water and rainwater collected on all Valeo Group sites. The measurement of water discharge was added to the reporting process in 2023 and includes water discharged to third parties or into a natural environment. Calculations of water consumption, discharges and withdrawals are based on actual data. Water consumption is calculated by subtracting water discharges from water withdrawals. To obtain a breakdown of the various metrics for areas of high- and extremely high-water stress, sites were classified using the WRI Aqueduct V4 tool. The Group records the amount of water treated on-site, recycled and reused in production. Stored water has been deliberately excluded from metrics as it represents immaterial volumes (firewater). Water intensity is measured using two numerators: • water consumption in accordance with ESRS E3-4; • water withdrawal to provide data comparable with those observed in previous reference periods. [ESRS E3 § 28] For withdrawals, 100% of data is from actual measurements. For water discharges, 40% of data is from actual discharge measurements, and 60% from estimates. 4.2.5.6 Anticipated financial effects from water-related impacts, risks and opportunities (DR E3-5) The CSRD allows companies to omit the information prescribed by ESRS E3-5 for the first year of preparation of its sustainability statement. For its first year of publication, Valeo has elected to activate the phase-in clause and not to report data on its anticipated financial effects from water-related impacts, risks and opportunities. To date, the Group's water-related operating expenses and capital expenditure are not automatically identifiable in its accounting systems. Valeo is therefore unable to report this information in respect of 2024. However, a process for identifying these OpEx and CapEx will be implemented in 2025. 4.2.6 Biodiversity (ESRS E4) 4.2.6.1 Transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model (DR E4-1) [ESRS E4 § 13] At this stage, the Group has not conducted a resilience analysis of its strategy and economic model in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems, as it does not have a direct dependence on natural resources that could be affected by systemic, physical and transition risks related to biodiversity and ecosystems. [ESRS 2 MDR – A§69] Initiatives related to IROs of the ESRS E4 topical standards are often integrated into broader action plans. However, Valeo does not always have the data granularity required to track current and future resources allocated to each action (BP 2).

"4.2.6.4 “Policies related to biodiversity”, page 250). Valeo’s commitment to protect biodiversity is further demonstrated by the environmental compliance analyses carried out at its sites and specifically on the Group’s new acquisitions. In the event of proven damage to biodiversity and ecosystems, Valeo has implemented appropriate restoration measures. Minimum safeguards With regard to the minimum safeguards set out in the Taxonomy Regulation, Valeo has longstanding policies and tools that enable it to meet requirements in respect of: • human rights, through the existence of adequate policies and risk management, supported by dedicated tools, such as internal and external whistleblowing procedures for its employees and suppliers, together with a package of sanctions. In 2024, Valeo was not subject to any convictions relating to a breach of its duty of care policies in terms of human rights; • corruption, through the existence of policies and a risk management approach; • taxation, through the existence of a tax policy based on taxation in the country of production; • compliance with competition laws, through the existence of a set of anti-fraud and anti-corruption training programs that are updated annually and mandatory for the entire population exposed to this risk. Thanks to its internal procedures, risk management policy and the absence of disputes relating to the minimum safeguards, Valeo can declare its products meet the minimum safeguards provision of the Taxonomy.

"4.2.6.4 Policies related to biodiversity (DR E4-2) [ESRS E4 § 23] At this stage of the analysis initiated in 2024, described in section 4.2.6.5 “Actions and resources dedicated to biodiversity”, page 250), the Group is not aware of: • significant impacts on biodiversity and shared ecosystems resulting from its activities: • material impacts on biodiversity and shared ecosystems resulting from its activities, • social consequences of biodiversity and ecosystem-related impacts caused directly by its activities. A more detailed and substantiated analysis will be carried out in 2025 with an external expert in the field. [ESRS E4 § 24] Almost all of the sites occupied by Valeo, i.e., nearly 90% of its production sites, are located in urban areas or areas zoned for industrial use, and the remaining 10% are located in agricultural or natural areas. In any event, its activities are not liable to significantly alter ecological processes (no extraction or spraying, for instance). However, to gain a more accurate understanding of its potential impacts, the Group conducts an annual inventory of sites located in or near (within 10 km) protected areas, and has carried out an analysis of the impacts and dependencies, and the resulting risks and dependencies, within the value chain. As part of their ISO 14001 environmental management system and the Group “Biodiversity” directive, which sets out guidelines for biodiversity protection practices during the selection, development and closure phases of plants, all plants and R&D centers implement preventive measures, notably to address the issues of land-use change and pollution, as well as material direct impacts on biodiversity, which may be identified where appropriate through due diligence audits at site level. Prior to the acquisition or leasing of land or buildings, a study is conducted to identify and list protected areas and species in order to maintain ecosystem conditions. Under no circumstances should a site development or expansion project be directly responsible for the disappearance of a forest or wetland, or for the disappearance of a protected species or its habitat. All such projects must therefore be sited away from protected areas. Measures are taken from the site design stage to preserve local biodiversity. During the operational phase, the site takes measures to maintain or improve arrangements made to maintain or improve biodiversity when the site was developed. Valeo is also committed to promoting sites’ biodiversity initiatives with a view to extend them to all sites: • recovery and reuse of food waste to make compost and supply neighboring farms; • elimination of the use of phytosanitary products; • tightened audit of the storage of chemical products; • reduction in the consumption and discharge of heavy metals. Finally, site closures must not result in biodiversity loss. With respect to its value chain, the Group has been assessing its main suppliers as regards their biodiversity practices since 2023 (see section 4.4.4 “Responsible purchasing”, page 293). The Group aims to progressively strengthen its biodiversity and ecosystem protection policy with respect to upstream players in its value chain. Valeo has used the ENCORE tool to identify its key upstream raw materials. This analysis takes into account the five major pressures on biodiversity. The Group addresses indirect policies that may affect biodiversity in the sections dedicated to ESRS E1, E2, E3 and E5. Most direct suppliers are not highly material. Valeo is in the process of constructing a plan aimed at improving the maturity of Tier N suppliers in the value chain in terms of their understanding of their impacts. In addition, as part of the CAP 50 transition plan, the share of biosourced materials is set to increase, particularly bioplastics. Valeo therefore aims to include measures to manage the impacts and dependencies related to the supply of natural resources in its duty-of-care plan, notably to ensure that biosourced materials do not put pressure on biomes, by changing land use for instance. Valeo also aims to involve actors in its ecosystem, particularly in the areas of mineral extraction and electronics (see section 4.4.4 “Responsible purchasing”, page 293). 4.2.6.5 Actions and resources dedicated to biodiversity (DR E4-3) [ESRS E4 § 25] - [ESRS E4 § 27] - [ESRS E4 § 28] To assess its impact on biodiversity, Valeo has implemented the LEAP approach recommended by the TNFD (1). Locate The Group has begun an inventory of sites located near (within 10 km) protected areas using the database made available by the Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) program. For each site identified, the IUCN classification of the species present within the perimeter was analyzed, and sites in the vicinity of “endangered” or “critically endangered” species were included in a list of “Sites of interest for biodiversity”. From this list, five sites with a listed species within a perimeter of less than 1 km were identified as “Biodiversity priority sites”. The inventory is updated annually to take account of changes in locations, and in KBA and IUCN data. At the same time, Valeo is looking to identify the areas of its value chain that interface with biodiversity, highlighting the most affected raw materials. A more detailed and substantiated analysis will be carried out in 2025 with an external expert in the field. Evaluate Valeo’s activities are not likely to significantly alter ecological processes, nor are they dependent on biodiversity. The Group has assessed the impacts of its priority sites against the five IPBES pressures and the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter, using data from the ENCORE database for the Auto Parts & Equipment activity. The “Pressure on biodiversity” impact was found to be of low materiality for all sites of interest for biodiversity. For all the Group’s activities, the dependencies assessed by the WWF Biodiversity Risk Filter are either immaterial or covered by an existing policy (water, pollution, waste).
