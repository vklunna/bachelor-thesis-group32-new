"8.4 environmental information note i climate change climate change has been a material topic for philips for many years, and the double materiality assessment (dma) performed in 2024 re-confirmed this. it has also been a part of senior management remuneration as further explained in remuneration report 2024. building on our success in achieving carbon neutrality in 2020, this chapter details how philips aligns its climate actions with the science based targets initiative (sbti) and european sustainability reporting standards (esrs). we will set out philips’ policy, targets and metrics, material climate-related risks and opportunities as well as actions and resources allocated to the transition. please note that philips is not excluded from any eu paris-aligned benchmarks as we do not meet any of the exclusion criteria stated in article 12.1 (d) to (g) of commission delegated regulation (eu) 2020/1818. policies, metrics and targets in this section, philips’ environmental policy, science based targets and climate action scope will be further explored. for a more detailed overview of this please refer to the climate resilience report. philips’ policy and targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation our climate action targets are in line with our environmental policy, aiming to reduce our full value chain emissions and building philips’ adaptive capacity. these targets therefore also help to address the impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change. philips set its first science-based emission reduction targets back in 2017 for its scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions, officially approved by the science based targets initiative (sbti). in 2022, philips has stepped-up and introduced new science based targets, covering scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (approximately 96% of our value chain emissions). we are therefore committed to collaborating with suppliers and customers to amplify our impact and reduce our footprint across the value chain. our scope 3 target includes the following greenhouse gas protocol categories: • category 1: purchased goods and services • category 4: upstream transportation and distribution • category 6: business travel • category 4: downstream transportation and distribution • category 11: use of sold products all other scope 3 emission categories are excluded from our inventory after a thorough assessment of their relevance and materiality in line with the ghg protocol and cdp reporting requirements. capital goods (category 2), fuel- and energy-related activities (category 3), waste generated in operations (category 5), employee commuting (category 7), and end-of-life treatment of sold products (category 12) are all considered immaterial due to size. additionally, upstream/ downstream leased assets (category 8 and 13), processing of sold products (category 10), franchises (category 14), and investments (category 15) are not applicable to philips'. this approach is consistent with the best practice of focusing on material categories that have the most impact on emissions reductions and ensures the accuracy and credibility of the disclosed inventory. for all of our sbti-approved and 1.5 °c-aligned targets, baselines and performance, please refer to the following table. these targets follow the cross-sector guidance of the sbti and take into consideration future developments such as changes in sales volumes, shifts in customer preferences and demand, regulatory factors, and advancements in technology. please note that we have also committed to net zero via sbti and are in the process of formalizing this target, including the target year. philips group science based targets reduction % compared to baseline scope coverage 2025 2030 2040 absolute contraction approach (aca) emission reduction targets scope 1 & 2 (baseline 2015) 100% -75% -90% scope 3 (baseline 2020) 95% -42% in accordance with the sbti guidance, our site specific direct (scope 1) and indirect (scope 2) emissions fall under the same target. during our baseline year, our scope 1 and 2 emissions were divided as follows: 26% scope 1 emissions and 74% scope 2 (market-based) emissions. in 2024, 89% of our target consisted of scope 1 emissions and 11% consisted of scope 2 (market-based) emissions. we have therefore decarbonized our scope 2 emissions at a faster rate compared with scope 1. all our consolidated subsidiaries contribute to our science based targets at group level listed above. we do not have material subsidiaries that are not fully consolidated and that would therefore require separate targets. in establishing our greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions baseline, the selection of the base year was guided by several considerations. more precisely, it was driven by historical data availability, the stability of operations during that period, and the desire to capture a representative snapshot of our emissions profile. in particular, we considered factors such as significant changes in business operations, facility expansions, or the implementation of emission reduction initiatives. contents 1 our management 2 strategy 3 financial performance 4

"despite the unprecedented challenges brought about by the covid-19 pandemic, the baseline year 2020 for scope 3 stands out as a significant year for philips, marked by a level of relative stability in both customer base and emissions profile. in contrast, the year 2015 was selected as the baseline for scope 1 and 2 emissions because it was the earliest feasible date for measurement and target-setting in alignment with the paris agreement. should enhancements in data quality or methodological changes lead to an emission deviation exceeding 5% compared with our current baseline emissions, we intend to restate the baseline in accordance with the science based targets initiative. actions associated with climate change in this section philips’ 2024 performance will be further described. this includes an analysis of our energy performance, gross scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, investments linked to carbon credits and internal carbon pricing mechanisms. this section will therefore provide further clarification on our 2024 performance. philips’ energy consumption and mix in 2024 our total energy demand has slightly increased by 2% compared to 2023. this was primarily due to an increased consumption of electricity and purchased heating, cooling and steam which can be linked to employees going to the office more frequently. most notably the amount of self generated non-fuel renewable energy has increased by 45% compared to 2023 highlighting our commitment to expand the share of on site renewables. as such we are making good progress in transitioning to renewable energy, increasing the share to 80% in 2024. we have therefore achieved our 2025 ambition of sourcing 75% of our energy from renewable sources. this is largely driven by multiple power purchase agreements (ppas) securing the supply of renewable electricity. prior to 2023, these included the los mirasoles wind farm in the us and the krammer and bouwdokken wind farms in the dutch province of zeeland. to further secure the long-term delivery and quality of renewable electricity for all our operations in europe, we increased our portfolio in 2023 and 2024 with a wind farm in mutkalampi, finland and a solar farm in pontinia, italy. in december 2023, we also closed our first direct renewable energy deal in china followed by a second one in december of 2024. for all remaining electricity demand, we acquire unbundled energy attribute certificates (eacs). details regarding the attributes per country are available through re100. eacs play a pivotal role in achieving our renewable energy target, aligning with the recommendations of re100. these instruments serve as strategic tools in our commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility. by investing in renewable energy projects through the purchase of eacs, we not only contribute to the growth of the clean energy sector, but also directly limit our carbon footprint associated with electricity consumption. for more information on our renewable energy strategy please refer to the renewable energy methodology. philips group energy consumption in megawatt hours (mwh) unless otherwise stated

"please note that no carbon pricing scheme associated with our scope 1 and 2 emissions (ets, carbon tax, etc.) has a current material impact on our financial statements. downstream transition events under the given low global warming scenario, it is assumed that there is strong socio-economic drive to shift towards a low-carbon economy. with more than 60% of our full value chain emissions residing downstream during the use phase of our products this is our main exposure. this could include energy efficiency policies, market forces demanding energy efficiency improvements and consumer preferences that drive technological advancements. the rapid change could lead to a situation where philips’ current technological capabilities lag behind those of our competitors and where the locked-in ghg emissions of our products inhibit our scope 3 target achievement. for a more detailed overview of this risk please refer to our climate resilience report that is available via our esg download page. to manage this risk, we continue our focus on energy efficiency, with energy as one of four key focal areas of our ecodesign program. all new product introductions are expected to optimize their energy efficiency. for more information on how ecodesign can help our target achievement besides the transition towards renewable energy please refer to philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. for a quantitative assessment of our locked-in ghg emissions associated with our products please refer to climate change and more specifically our emission associated with purchased goods and use of sold products. resources allocated to climate change to strengthen our climate resilience from both adaptation and mitigation perspective and meet external commitments (e.g. science based targets) we have allocated resources to reducing our environmental impact and preparing for potential acute and chronic climate related risks. past and current resources philips has allocated resources to enhance environmental resilience, including proceeds from the green and sustainability innovation bonds issued under philips’ green and sustainability innovation bond framework (april 24, 2019). these funds have been invested in green and sustainability eligible projects aligned with the objectives of: • reducing value chain emissions (climate mitigation) • building adaptive capacity (climate adaptation) all bonds issued under the framework follow the international capital market association (icma) green bond principles 2018, social bond principles 2018 and the icma sustainability bond guidelines 2018, to ensure that the selected and disclosed projects meet widely recognized criteria. for more information, visit https://www.philips.com/a-w/about/investor-relations/debt.html. we have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. for climate mitigation and adaptation, a subset of the expenditures for the eu taxonomy reporting are relevant. this is equivalent to approximately eur 3 million (0.3%) of our eu taxonomy aligned capex related to our actions to improve energy efficiency, phase out fossil fuels and build adaptive capacity on site. refer to our eu taxonomy disclosures for more. we have also invested eur 263 million in green innovation in 2024 to support our efforts in reducing our biggest emissions contributors which are purchased goods and use of sold products. in total, our aforementioned expenditures cover these key actions related to our decarbonization levers: • designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase • minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives • collaborating with our suppliers to reduce emissions in our supply chain • reducing emissions from logistics by optimizing our planning horizon • transitioning to lower carbon-emitting energy at our sites future resources to ensure we meet our future climate targets and continue to build our adaptive capacity, it is important that future resources are allocated to our target achievement, such as: • investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency • development of ecodesigned new product introductions and partnerships • infrastructure resilience, flood defense improvements, and climate-resilient, nature-based solutions the final financial planning including future financial resources related to our transition plan is in progress. philips’ emission calculation methodologies: philips reports in line with the greenhouse gas protocol (ghgp). the ghgp distinguishes three scopes, as described below. the ghgp requires businesses to report on the first two scopes to comply with the ghgp reporting standards. as per the updated ghgp scope 2 reporting guidance, from 2015 onward our scope 2 emissions reporting includes both the market-based method and the location-based method. the market-based method of reporting will serve as our reference for calculating our total carbon footprint. as part of our carbon footprint, philips also reports on five scope 3 categories. these are indirect emissions that reside either upstream or downstream and are included in our approved science based target of 42% reduction by 2030. scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions these are direct emissions caused by company owned and -controlled entities. for example, the burning of fossil fuels and the use of refrigerants or chemicals on-site generates scope 1-related co2-e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions. sites report their consumption of refrigerants, and anthropogenic or biogenic-based fuels via our internal sustainability reporting system. consumption per resource is then aggregated across all sites and multiplied by resource-specific emission factors. this approach is being used for all industrial sites and 80% of our non-industrial sites’ floor area. for all other sites, consumption is extrapolated. for scope 1 emissions we use two sets of emission factors. for fossil fuels and natural gases, we use

"please refer to the climate resilience report 2024 that can be found via our esg download page. most importantly our definitions for the short-, medium-, and long-term diverge from our central definition prescribed by the esrs. this was done in consultation with other departments, to ensure perpetual business continuity and acknowledge the fact that climate related risks and opportunities generally materialize beyond a 5-year time horizon. it also accounts for the time horizons linked to our commitments. philips group impact risk and opportunity management time horizons time horizons short term medium term long term duration 1 < x < 2 years 5 < x < 10 years 10 < x < 25 years target year 2025 2030 2050* * 2100-time horizon for sea level rise due to limited data availability (physical risk exposure) and 2040 for site related emissions (transition pathway) philips transition plan for climate change mitigation together with our customers and suppliers, we aim to reduce our collective carbon footprint and build a more sustainable and resilient healthcare industry, in line with a 1.5 degrees scenario (as validated by sbti). this aligns and is embedded in our business strategy as well as financial planning. to achieve this, we focus on the following core objectives, prioritized by their potential impact. further details on underlying assumptions are available in our climate resilience report, which has been approved by our administrative, management and supervisory bodies. designing energy-efficient products and collaborating with our customers to reduce emissions during the use-phase since most of our climate impact occurs downstream during the use-phase of our products, we are dedicated to designing energy-efficient solutions and supporting the transition to renewable energy sources. all new product introductions adhere to our ecodesign requirements, where energy efficiency is a key focus. this approach allows us to engineer a product portfolio optimized for energy consumption during use, which not only reduces our environmental footprint but also helps our customers lower their operational costs. moreover, the adoption of renewable energy by our customers, also supports our use phase decarbonization by eliminating co2-e emissions during the energy generation. we therefore actively support and encourage our customers in their transition to renewables (see champalimaud case). our key assumption is that electrical grids will decarbonize in line with the international energy agency’s (iea) stated policy scenario (sps) or announced pledge scenario (aps). based on preliminary estimates, we expect to reduce our use phase (ghgp category 11) carbon footprint as follows: philips group expected use-phase emission reduction in kilotonnes co2-equivalent unless otherwise stated current medium-term long-term (expected) emissions level 2,529 2,797 – 2,330 1,590 – 98 reduction compared to 2020 baseline 2,631 2,363 – 2,829 3,570 – 5,062 percentage reduction compared to 2020 baseline 51% 46% - 55% 69% - 98% minimizing our purchased goods emissions by adopting circular economy practices and transitioning to sustainable alternatives from a climate perspective, applying circular business models has the potential for significant emission reductions. by retaining materials’ value, we reduce the need for virgin resources and the energy required to produce them, resulting in lower emissions. this approach is led by our circular economy team through the principles of ‘use less, use longer, and use again’, which also includes our ambition of ‘closing the loop’. circular design is one of the key focal areas of ecodesign, which includes for example design for low weight, which reduces the need for material extraction and thereby contributes to emission reductions. it also includes designing with sustainable materials (recycled, biobased, etc.), which often require less energy to process, cutting down greenhouse gases in the sourcing and manufacturing phase. for our personal health segment, for example, this includes replacing virgin plastic packaging with paper-based alternatives or increasing the recycled content of the materials we use. next, we focus on increasing circular practices at our sites and responsible waste management according to the waste hierarchy. as such we actively monitor the waste management of our industrial sites with the aim of retaining the value of materials. this is further explained in sustainable operations. lastly, we initiated the process to focus on responsibly reusing products and parts at the end of their use. among other things, this includes refurbishment, and responsible takeback. by recirculating products, parts and materials, we increase the market for used products and ensure materials are longer in use. altogether we believe that by applying our circularity principles, we will be able to reduce our purchased goods emissions (ghgp category 1) by: philips group expected purchased goods emission reduction in kilotonnes co2-equivalent unless otherwise stated current medium-term long-term (expected) emissions level 904 1,023 – 872 812 – 148 reduction compared to 2020 baseline 275 156 – 307 367 – 1,031 percentage reduction compared to 2020 baseline 23% 13% -

business travel our business travel emissions increased by 27% compared to 2023. this is mainly due to the restructuring at philips that required increased travel to allow for an optimal transition. the post- pandemic increase in travel was also driven by a need to align with customers which further contributed to the increased emissions. moving forward, we continue to electrify our lease fleet and promote online collaboration, as well as increase our efforts to move travelers to rail transport for shorter distances. with tightened travel budgets in 2025, we aim to curb the growth of travel emissions. philips group business travel emissions per mode of transportation in tonnes co2-equivalent 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 air travel 21,433 21,051 30,231 42,130 60,453 lease cars 46,503 48,370 52,838 45,249 52,365 rental cars 2,223 2,723 3,330 3,397 2,716 philips group 70,158 72,144 86,399 90,776 115,534 scope 3, category 11 -

"we finance projects in emerging regions that have a strong link with un sustainable development goals 3 and 12. to ensure these offsets meet our high-quality standard of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting, philips only procures carbon credits from carbon standards that are endorsed by icroa, such as vcs standard and gold standard. each program is also verified by an independent third party. we ensure, through our providers, that the quality criteria of additionality, permanence and avoidance of double counting are met. in addition, philips has conducted site visits to some of the projects in our portfolio. none of our credits as of now are subject to corresponding adjustment under article 6 of the paris agreement. philips will follow the developments of article 6 closely to understand if, and when, any of the projects might become subject to corresponding adjustments. please note that all removal credits are associated with biogenic sinks and linked to activities outside philips value chain. all our carbon offsets drive social, economic and environmental progress in emerging markets. in 2024 we did not retire any carbon credits from removal projects. our projects include: restoring ecosystems and empowering communities through tree planting in kenya, subsistence farmers are supported to plant and maintain trees on their land through the international small group and tree planting program (tist). this carbon removal project enhances biodiversity, improves soil fertility, and strengthens community resilience, providing co-benefits beyond carbon sequestration. farmers retain ownership of the trees and their products, receiving training and a share of carbon revenues. as an afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (arr) initiative, it is a nature-based solution contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. to ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the vcs standard with the ccb label. providing access to safe drinking water while reducing wood consumption this carbon-emission reduction project is expected to provide millions of liters of safe drinking water in uganda and reduce the mortality risk from water-borne diseases. additionally, less wood will be required for boiling water, leading to less indoor air pollution and slowing down the deforestation rate. as such, this contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. to ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the gold standard. protecting forests through sustainable production deforestation is expected to be reduced through promotion of sustainable businesses to protect the forest. unsustainable harvest of fuelwood is reduced, thereby contributing to the protection of a biogenic sink. the forest supports the supply of water to other parts of ethiopia and neighboring countries. it is also the habitat of diverse and, in some cases, rare species. to ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the vcs standard. increasing employment through provision of sustainable energy in india, the energy supply gap is reduced by providing access to clean energy and related employment through wind generation. this is therefore considered a technological solution that also enables an improvement in livelihoods. to ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the vcs standard. improving respiratory health and reducing deforestation through provision of clean cookstoves by supporting a range of cookstove technologies across ghana and kenya, the projects improve respiratory health, reduce fuel costs and reduce deforestation. as such, this project contributes to the protection of a biogenic sink. this also gives people more time for paid work, thus improving prospects. to ensure quality, all offsets are verified under the gold standard. philips’ internal carbon pricing at philips, we apply an internal carbon shadow discount price for our it, real estate, businesses and r&d investments. if an investment may support our climate targets by reducing co2-e emissions, the relevant function and/or business is encouraged to apply eur 150 discount per saved tonne co2-e. this enables all functions and businesses to incorporate climate impacts in their business case development. furthermore, by using a discount we proactively incentivize the pursuit of sustainable projects, rather than imposing penalties on unsustainable investments. the scope spans all philips operations and includes scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as all the material scope 3 categories. there are no geographic or business-specific boundaries. this therefore covers 100% of our scope 1 & 2 targets and approximately 95% of our gross scope 3 emissions (96% of overall emissions). the price of eur 150 per metric ton co2-e is derived from the internationally recognized recipe methodology, in combination with the environmental pricing provided by ce delft. the price is also validated by an external body other than our assurance provider, namely kpmg and set in alignment with our ep&l statement. the key assumption is that the price of carbon will increase in the future. therefore, to ensure price stability over the coming years, an uplift was applied to the price of carbon, identified by ce delft. please note that the internal carbon pricing is not considered in the financial statements as the assumptions in the financial statements are based on (external) market assumptions. philips group carbon pricing in tonnes co2-equivalent unless otherwise stated type of carbon price volume at stake (tco2-e) price

"scope materials within the ep&l. while biological materials like paper are suitable for biological loops, these are also materials that can be recycled and have a high rate of recyclable content. that is why the recyclable content is higher for our biological materials (100%) compared to our technical materials (50%). for our biological and renewable materials, it is important to note that in line with the 1st priority of the cascading principle, these materials are used in our products and packaging and not for energy purposes. similar to our renewable materials, 1% of philips material flow was from sustainably sourced biological materials. the results are similar because most renewable materials are also considered biological. diagnosis & treatment and connected care contributed with 2.5 kilotonnes of reused materials. this includes our circular edition refurbished medical equipment and recirculated parts. personal health contributed with 0.01 kilotonnes from refurbished products. actions philips circular revenues, which is our overarching circularity metric, increased with 4% compared to 2023. the step-up is mainly driven by contributions from circular design, mostly from low-weight design and use of sustainable materials. revenues associated with circular services in use-phase dropped, mainly related to reclassifying products within ‘circular service in use-phase’ to other circular revenue categories. this is also one of the main reasons why circular revenues from circular delivery and financing models increased compared to 2023. philips group philips circular revenues as % of total philips revenues 5.5% 7.5% 1.9% 6.1% 3.3% 5.2% 9.2% 5.7% circular services in-use phase circular end-of-use management circular design of software and hardware circular delivery and financing models 2023 2024 more detailed actions to deliver on our 2025 circularity commitments are described in subsequent sections. circular design of software and hardware our ecodesign program is a key driver for our circular economy program. one of the focal areas of ecodesign is circularity, which encompasses, for example, the application of recycled and bio-based materials and designing for low weight, durability, disassembly, and recycling. a subset of ecodesigned products, those which specifically outperform on the focal area of circular design, will therefore also be counted as contributing to circular revenues target metric. these include, for example, products that meet defined thresholds on reduced weight compared to competitor products or their predecessors. durability is a product’s ability to remain functional and relevant when used as intended and can be expressed through different ways such as reliability and lifetime. at this moment, philips cannot report on the durability of its product groups compared to industry average, as there are no publicly available industry averages for our product groups. we however continue our efforts to optimize lifetime either through circular design requirements (by outperforming on our ecodesign requirements for ‘design for durability & reliability’ vs predecessor) or for which lifetime extensions and refurbishment can be offered. most of our medical equipment portfolio is serviceable, including service instructions for professional maintenance, and spare parts and support availability over the product lifetime. consumer products are being redesigned as required to meet all relevant new standards and regulations including right to repair regulations and the eu battery directive, if applicable and required. philips strives to improve professional and consumer repairability of its products, and our design process includes tools to assess repairability. circular manufacturing and supply in line with our ambition for fully circular operations, philips applies lean methodologies to improve processes and continuously reduce the environmental footprint across our sites. circular materials management is our leading kpi and is not expressed in circular revenues. we retain as much as possible material value of our waste stream through waste management and increasing circular practices at our sites. waste related to biological materials is taken care of according to the cascading principle, which is similar to the waste hierarchy for which we apply with regards to waste from technical materials. we team up with our supply chain partners to find circular solutions for discarded materials, for example in the ’waste to value’ initiative. for inbound supplier packaging, we aim to replace single-use packaging with more sustainable solutions like reusable boxes to contribute to our packaging waste ambitions from recycling to re-use and reduce. for example, at the philips personal health industrial site in zhuhai 0.8 kilotonnes of plastic waste and 0.4 kilotonnes of cardboard waste were prevented by implementing reusable plastic trays to replace cardboard box partitions and implementing circular systems in which boxes are continuously sent back to the suppliers for them to use again for the supply of future shipments. through initiatives like this in 2024, a total of 4.8 kilotonnes of waste were prevented or reused, thereby averting end of life emissions of 3.0 kilotonnes of co2-e (assuming incineration as end-of- life treatment). for more

"packaging put to market (stemming from the philips environmental profit and loss account – ep&l) with the eu weee recycling rates. for products, we use a 3-year average weight put to market, and for packaging we use the weight put to market in the reporting year only. this is a slight change from last year, where we used a 3-year average for both. the change in methodology for packaging is because we assume that packaging is disposed of in the year of purchase. due to this change, this year’s figure is not comparable to last year. impact, risk and opportunity management in this section, philips’ nature risk assessment approach (including risks related to resource use and circular economy), and the results of this assessment, will be explained. philips nature risk assessment approach philips recognizes the importance of identifying, assessing and mitigating nature-related risks to ensure business continuity and resilience. the task force on nature-related financial disclosures (tnfd) report provides information needed by investors, lenders, insurance underwriters, and other stakeholders to appropriately assess nature-related risks and opportunities, including those related to esrs e5. to identify and evaluate our impacts and dependencies (actual and potential) and assess related risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy, we applied the locate, evaluate, assess, and prepare (leap) approach, in line with the recommended approach of tnfd. this approach constitutes four stages: locate (philips’ interface with nature), evaluate (philips’ dependencies and impacts on nature), assess (philips’ nature-related risks and opportunities) and prepare (to respond to and report on material nature-related issues). this is also aligned with the recommended disclosures for task force on nature-related financial disclosures (tnfd). as part of the locate stage, we determined the scope of our risk and opportunities assessment includes philips’ businesses, regions, and functions focusing on philips’ 23 manufacturing sites. to apply the leap approach, philips used multiple available tools such as an external risk insurance tool (munich re), the ecosystem intelligence tool (ecometrix), and the philips ep&l. local teams at our manufacturing sites were involved in the impact assessment to identify high priority nature-related risks and opportunities. as part of the improvement opportunities in developing the leap approach, we aim to expand the consultations with local affected stakeholders in the coming years. philips nature risk assessment results in the evaluate stage, the dependencies analysis results showed dependencies on the ecosystem services like resource extraction. while resource extraction occurs outside the scope of our manufacturing sites, we further assessed its dependencies and impacts on material flows based on 2023 ep&l data. see philips material flows for more information. the highest dependencies identified are: paper & cardboard (29%), plastics (29%) and metals (21%). in terms of materials type, the highest impacts are caused by metals (including processing) (37%), pcbs (33%), and electronics components (10%). overall, the majority of the material impacts are found in the upstream value chain. as part of the assess stage, we applied the same time horizons in the climate-related risk assessments. these timeframes are agreed in the kunming-montreal global biodiversity framework (gbf) for ‘halting and reversing nature loss’ and ‘living in harmony with nature’. see philips transition plan for climate change mitigation. the main physical and transitional risks include: physical philips only uses limited amounts of water, but four manufacturing sites are located in water- stressed regions. continued and/or expansion of business operations could place additional stress on scarcer water supply. transitional a high priority risk identified is the volatility of costs of materials due to change in global abundance of resources: our analysis suggests that the highest risk stems from rising costs from material scarcity due to various geopolitical drivers as well as developments in the non-renewables market in the upstream value chain. secondly, philips could face challenges in incorporating ecodesign criteria from new or upcoming legislation into its products and services. the prepare phase establishes metrics and targets related to nature-related dependencies and impacts. these have been set as part of our esg 2025 commitments. for targets linked to circularity of resource inflows, outflows and waste management, see philips’ policy and 2025 circularity targets. allocated resources to resource use and circular economy to support the transition towards a circular economy and ensure we meet our external circularity commitments, we have allocated resources. past and current resources part of philips resources is from the proceeds of the green and sustainability innovation bonds that were issued under philips’ green and sustainability innovation bond framework dated april 24, 2019. refer to climate change for more information. in addition to the proceeds, we also have other expenditures allocated to our environmental objectives. for circular economy, a subset of the expenditures for the eu taxonomy reporting are relevant. this is equivalent to approximately eur 83 million (13%) of our capex related to our actions to grow circular revenue sales from 'circular delivery and financing models' and 'circular end-of-use management'. the former amounts to eur 72 million from 'ce4.1 provision of it/ot data driven solutions' and 'ce5.5. product-as-a-service and other circular use- and result oriented services'. their expenditures relate mainly to property, plant, equipment and right-of-use assets (75%) followed by intangible assets (25%). the expenditures of ‘circular end-of-use management’ amounts to eur 11 million from 'ce5.1 repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing' and 'ce5.2 sales of spare parts'. their expenditures only relate to property, plant, equipment and right-of-use assets. approximately eur 361 million (19%) of our opex expenditures relate primarily to our actions to grow circular revenue sales from 'circular delivery and financing models'. this amounts to eur 357 million from 'ce4.1 provision of it/ot contents

"6.2.2.2 ​transition plan for climate change mitigation (e1-1) in line with the company’s purpose, “pioneering sustainable aerospace for a safe and united world”, and its aim to lead the transition of the air transport sector towards the goal set by the international air transport association (iata), air transport action group (atag) and international civil aviation organization (icao) to reach ‘net zero carbon emissions by 2050’, the company’s foremost ambition is to play a leading role in the decarbonisation of the aviation sector. this includes developing technologies for the next generations of commercial aircraft, and the ambition to bring a commercially viable, fully electric, hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft into service. based on the international energy agency (iea) remaining global carbon budget and the share it allocates to air transport, air transport can grow at up to a certain level and meet the paris agreement objectives. this relies in part on technological developments to improve the fuel efficiency of air transport, in which the company and its suppliers have a role to play. this approach also echoes “net-zero carbon emissions by 2050” ambitions from international sectoral bodies such as the atag, as well as the un specialised civil aviation body, icao. this is consistent with the company’s near-term target setting, covering all three scopes of emissions, and with its core product policy that focuses on developing and delivering more efficient aircraft while engaging with the energy ecosystem. the company has set combined near-term targets to reduce its ghg emissions (please refer to “– 6.2.2.6 targets (e1-4)” for a detailed description) that are validated by the sbti as being science-based and aligned with limiting global warming to 1.5°c for scopes 1 and 2 and with well-below 2°c for scope 3 relating to the use of its commercial aircraft in service (scope 3 use of sold products (cat 11)). this is in accordance with sbti's criteria and recommendations for near-term targets. share of company's commercial business segment scope 3 use of sold products emissions unit in overall commercial business segment emissions (all scopes) % >95% in overall company emissions (all scopes) % >90% the company's scope 3 use of sold products co2 intensity projections (co2/rpk) are related to the company's delivered commercial aircraft in a given year (2015/2035) over the entire life of service. to achieve its ghg emission targets, the company has developed a transition plan of climate mitigation actions. the plan is structured into decarbonisation levers and sub-levers, which cover innovation in the company’s product and service portfolio, its own operations, and in the company’s value chain. a diverse range of factors of different climate scenarios have been considered to detect relevant environmental, societal, technology, market and policy-related developments and determine decarbonisation levers. for more details on the usage of scenarios, please refer to the “– 6.2.2.3 description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (esrs 2 iro-1) and material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (esrs 2 sbm-3)” hereafter. key actions within each decarbonisation lever are detailed in the section “– 6.2.2.5 actions (e1-3)”. the integration of the decarbonisation levers across all of the company’s business activities, coupled with the focus on enhancing efficiency in its products, translates the objectives of the transition plan into the company’s business model and strategy. the potential of technological levers to support the compatibility of the company's business model with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the limiting of global warming to 1.5°c in line with the paris agreement and the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 are based on its experience and expertise in the field of commercial aviation in collaboration with industrial partners such as engine manufacturers. energy and saf related levers are informed by the sector's work on the topic as well as elements drawn from iea scenarios and regulatory frameworks around the world. the transition plan has been approved by the company’s executive committee and the board of directors. regular updates on the progress of this plan are presented to the board’s ecsc. airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 165"
"6.2.2.5 actions (e1-3)”): decarbonisation lever #1 - energy efficiency (scopes 1&2). this decarbonisation lever focuses on increasing building (stationary) energy efficiency and mobile energy efficiency. decarbonisation lever #2 - renewable energy (scopes 1&2). this decarbonisation lever focuses on switching to renewable energy through power purchase agreements (ppa) (stationary), developing local site renewable energy generation (stationary), and uptake of saf in its internal operations - logistics and flight tests - (mobile). decarbonisation lever #3 - technology improvement introduction (scope 3). this decarbonisation lever focuses on the continuous improvement of the latest generation aircraft as well as developing next generation aircraft that are more fuel efficient than current models. decarbonisation lever #4 - saf uptake (scope 3). this decarbonisation lever focuses on fostering the development of the saf ecosystem, contributing to the setting of industry standards for fuels, and developing aircraft that are 100% saf capable. decarbonisation lever #5 - operations improvement (scope 3). this decarbonisation lever focuses on developing the commercial aircraft portfolio of services aimed at supporting customers in reducing emissions arising from the usage of commercial aircraft, in collaboration with relevant actors in the air transport sector (e.g. air traffic management). the last three decarbonisation levers refer to the company’s scope 3 use of sold products. they imply a close collaboration with many players in the aviation and energy sectors and are consistent with the aviation sector's long-term aspirational decarbonisation goal of reaching “net-zero carbon emissions” by 2050, as illustrated on the following chart. in october 2022, the aspirational objective of “net zero carbon emissions” in 2050 for international civil aviation operations was adopted by a vast majority of icao member states. this political commitment paves the way for the transformation of the aviation sector, ensuring a level playing field at international level and it will accelerate the development of mitigation measures such as fleet renewal, aircraft and engine technologies, alternative energy carriers such as saf or green hydrogen, and the enhancements of the operational practices and air traffic management. the company fully supports this international long-term aspirational goal. the company's activities are not excluded by the eu’s paris-aligned benchmark framework. investing in the future the company’s total research and development budget (see table below) is mainly split between - but not limited to - investments in incremental developments of the company’s current product portfolio which is required to maintain its competitiveness, including from a fuel / co2 efficiency perspective, as well as investment in the development of breakthrough technologies (e.g. hydrogen based systems, electric machines, energy storage and distribution) that are required for future products. airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 166"
"6.2.2.8 ghg emissions (e1-6)”. locked-in ghg emissions - assets. emissions from all key assets are tracked by the company's environmental reporting. future emissions are calculated based on local energy network assumptions and taking into account the decarbonisation levers (as described above) and the impact of industrial production evolution. locked-in ghg emissions for these assets are calculated as the sum of yearly residual emissions until 2030, with further efforts being required for evaluating the locked-in ghg emissions until 2050. locked-in emissions were taken into account when ghg emission reduction targets were set. for more details on how the company plans to manage its ghg-intensive and energy intensive assets and products, refer to the “– 6.2.2.2 transition plan for climate mitigation (e1-1)” and “– 6.2.2.5 actions (e1-3)”. tracking progress and performance scope 1 & 2 market-based ghg emissions unit target year target value % vs baseline baseline year baseline value 2024 value 2023 value yoy change 2024 vs. baseline company (sbti approved) ktco2e 2030 467 -63% 2015 1,262 614 675 -9% -51% “tco scope” (1) ktco2e 2024 581 -2% 2023 592 524 592 -11% -11% assumptions and (1): see “scope of reporting and methodology” in “– 6.2.2.8 ghg emissions (e1-6)” scopes 1&2 ghg emissions have decreased, exceeding the yearly target (see table), primarily due to five factors: a production adjustment during the year, clement weather conditions especially during winter, emission factor updates as well as savings from the increased usage of saf and biofuels in own operations and the increased purchase of renewable electricity. this supports the trajectory towards the 2030 target, that integrates expected upcoming aircraft production ramp-up. airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 167"
"6.2.2.8 ghg emissions (e1-6)” since 2015, the improvement of commercial aircraft scope 3 efficiency - measured through this metric - was largely supported by significant investments into new aircraft technology and designs, as well as by projected saf uptake impact to a lower extent. given the variable time horizons of each of the five decarbonisation pathways presented above, it is expected that the forecasted increase of saf used by airlines in the coming decades will have a decisive impact for achieving this target by 2035. in order to be able to check how actual global penetration of saf is consistent with its target related assumptions, the company is developing the means to monitor actual availability and use of saf and the resulting impact on aircraft emissions. the company's initial approach to develop a tool that has proven insufficient and the company is now considering alternative options. one such option is to rely on aviation industry recognised metrics being developed. for instance, iata is maturing its analytical capability to monitor saf consumption through direct reporting from airlines. key figure unit 2024 est. annual saf production, as per iata report * tonnes 1 million * “fact sheet - sustainable aviation fuels” dated dec 9th 2024 available on iata website for more information on the progress in implementing the transition plan, refer to section “– 6.2.2.5 actions (e1-3)”. 6.2.2.3 ​description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (esrs 2 iro-1) and material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (esrs 2 sbm-3) following the tcfd recommendations, the company has defined a range of temperature scenarios (1.5°c, well-below 2°c and >3°c) to represent different climate realities based upon the global scenarios of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (""ipcc"" - assessment report 6 (""ar6"")) and the international energy agency (""iea""). the scenario analysis is used to identify financial and operational risks and opportunities related to climate change that may begin to impact the company in the short-term, medium-term and long-term so that the company can work to increase the resilience of its assets and airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 168"
"6.2.2.3 description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (esrs 2 iro-1) and material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (esrs 2 sbm-3)”. the resilience analysis includes a review of the company’s own business activities and extends to both upstream and downstream segments of the value chain, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and strengths in the company's strategy and business model concerning climate-related physical and transition risks. with the 1.5°c scenario for transition risk and the >3°c scenario for the physical risk analysis, the company covers both extremes of climate risks, thus covering a broad spectrum of risks. as detailed above, the scope of the resilience analysis is the same as the climate risk assessment; it includes an assessment of operations, supply chain dependencies, and customer interactions to ensure a holistic understanding of potential impacts for all of the company’s business activities. for each remaining identified material physical and transition risks, the existing and potential adaptation measures that contribute to climate resilience are reviewed, resulting in an overall risk picture, including those residual risks where mitigation measures are insufficient to eliminate the risks entirely. the conducted analysis has identified activities related to the transition of the air transport sector as high-risk business activities, with uncertainties including the pace of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market acceptance of low-carbon solutions. this assessment of physical risks for the upstream value chain is still being conducted and therefore is not yet included in these results. the outcomes to date of the physical and transition risk assessments are summarised in the hereafter tables, as well as how these risks are managed to ensure the resilience of the company's assets and activities. as mentioned previously, the resilience analysis is still ongoing and is expected to be completed in 2027. climate-related risks the results of the company’s climate scenario analysis has led to the identification of the following main risks: ●​ transition - technology: emergence of disruptive technologies from competition delivering on existing commitments and potential future requirements to mitigate climate impacts will require significant investments in new technologies for the commercial aircraft sector, making the delivery of low-emission technologies a significant marker of future competitiveness. a competitor or new market participant could have access to technological developments unavailable to the company that offer significantly lower emissions at a faster pace than the company and its partners, resulting in a loss of market share and competitiveness with resulting reduced revenue. the imperative for the company and its partners to develop new technologies faster than other actors in the market will require substantial research and technology (r&t) and research and development investments. airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 171"
"6.2.2.2 transition plan for climate mitigation (e1-1)” and to the above mentioned risk management mitigation measures provide a first understanding of the company's ability to adapt its strategy and business model to climate change. additionally, the section “– 6.2.2.5 actions (e1-3)” provides further information on the adaptation actions taken by the company to reinforce its resilience. more precisely, with regards to product resilience in the context of climate change, aircraft products are sensitive to weather phenomena during their operation phase. while the certified flight envelopes of the company’s products offer some margin compared to relevant bad atmospheric conditions defined by certification authorities, the adaptation of aircraft design and operation to the changing climate is an important activity to be anticipated, in particular given the long lead time associated with aircraft development and operation. with regards to its defence product portfolio, the company is collaborating with the north atlantic treaty organization (“nato”) and other defence industry players and organisations (in the so-called nato study group 291) with the objective of developing recommendations on ensuring allied capabilities adaptation in the context of climate change. this is supported by inputs from the nato climate and defence task force led by the conference of national armaments directors (cnad) the company is also part of, together with the allied governments and other defence industry players. this collaboration aims at assessing, elaborating and deploying solutions to ensure technical capabilities still enable operational effectiveness in facing changing climatic conditions. airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 173"

"6.2.2.8 ghg emissions (e1-6)” since 2015, the improvement of commercial aircraft scope 3 efficiency - measured through this metric - was largely supported by significant investments into new aircraft technology and designs, as well as by projected saf uptake impact to a lower extent. given the variable time horizons of each of the five decarbonisation pathways presented above, it is expected that the forecasted increase of saf used by airlines in the coming decades will have a decisive impact for achieving this target by 2035. in order to be able to check how actual global penetration of saf is consistent with its target related assumptions, the company is developing the means to monitor actual availability and use of saf and the resulting impact on aircraft emissions. the company's initial approach to develop a tool that has proven insufficient and the company is now considering alternative options. one such option is to rely on aviation industry recognised metrics being developed. for instance, iata is maturing its analytical capability to monitor saf consumption through direct reporting from airlines. key figure unit 2024 est. annual saf production, as per iata report * tonnes 1 million * “fact sheet - sustainable aviation fuels” dated dec 9th 2024 available on iata website for more information on the progress in implementing the transition plan, refer to section “– 6.2.2.5 actions (e1-3)”. 6.2.2.3 ​description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (esrs 2 iro-1) and material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model (esrs 2 sbm-3) following the tcfd recommendations, the company has defined a range of temperature scenarios (1.5°c, well-below 2°c and >3°c) to represent different climate realities based upon the global scenarios of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (""ipcc"" - assessment report 6 (""ar6"")) and the international energy agency (""iea""). the scenario analysis is used to identify financial and operational risks and opportunities related to climate change that may begin to impact the company in the short-term, medium-term and long-term so that the company can work to increase the resilience of its assets and airbus se/ report of the board of directors 2024 168"

and land. the group applies ias 41 to account its forest assets. own land is stated at cost whereas leased land is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. any changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in the operating profit in the income statement. the fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows considering existing, sustainable harvesting plans and assessments regarding growth, timber prices, harvesting and silviculture costs and selling expenses. forest renewal costs are capitalised during the growth cycle as part of the forest assets value. the fair value of forest assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy. key estimates and judgements fair valuation the valuation process of forest assets is complex and requires management estimates and judgement on assumptions that have a significant impact on the valuation of the group’s forest assets. main factors used in the fair valuation of forest assets are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates. stumpage price forecasts are based on the current prices adjusted by the management’s estimates for the full remaining productive lives of the trees, up to 150 years or until next regeneration cutting for forests in finland and in the us and up to 10 years for plantations in uruguay. the cash flows are adjusted by selling costs and costs related to future risks. felling revenues and maintenance costs are estimated on the basis of actual costs and prices, taking into account the group’s projection of future price and costs development. in addition, calculations take into account future forest growth and environmental restrictions. the pre-tax discount rate used to determine the fair value of the finnish forests in 2024 was 9.7% (9.5%) and for uruguayan plantations 11.2% (11.5%). a decrease (increase) of one percentage point in discount rate would increase (decrease) the fair value of forest assets by approximately eur 221 million (214 million). 4.3 energy shareholdings upm is both a significant purchaser and producer of energy. the majority of electrical and thermal energy is consumed at the group’s pulp and paper production. the production is mainly carried out by energy companies in which upm has energy shareholdings. energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments. based on the shareholder agreements, upm does not have control or joint control of or significant influence in the said energy companies. the value of energy shareholdings amounted to eur 2,247 million (2,283 million) at the end of 2024. these energy companies supply electricity or both electricity and heat to their shareholders on a cost- price principle (mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the finnish energy industry. under the mankala-principle electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned. in 2020, upm issued a shareholder loan of eur 47 million without a maturity date to pvo. embedded into the loan terms is a right to issue new shares in the pvo b2 series against the remaining, unpaid nominal of the loan starting from 2021. the loan is valued at fair value and is taken into account as a part of the total fair valuation of the pvo b2 series valuation. energy shareholdings number of shares group holding

3) in finland. the operation of a nuclear power plant is governed by international, european union and local nuclear regulatory regimes. pursuant to the finnish nuclear liability act, the operator of a nuclear facility has a strict third-party liability in relation to nuclear accidents. shareholders of power companies that own and operate nuclear power plants are not subject to the liability under the nuclear liability act. in finland, the future costs of conditioning, storage and final disposal of spent fuel, management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste as well as nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by a state established fund (the finnish state nuclear waste management fund). the contributions to the fund are intended to be sufficient to cover estimated future costs. these contributions have been taken into consideration in the fair value of the related energy shareholdings. changes in energy shareholdings eurm 2024 2023 carrying value, at 1 january 2,283 3,652 disposals -4 — changes in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income -32 -1,369 carrying value, at 31 december 2,247 2,283 accounting policies the group has made an irrevocable election to designate its energy shareholdings as equity instruments where changes in fair value are recognised through oci. the shareholdings are not held for trading as the group has an intention to hold the investments for the long term. purchases of energy shareholdings are initially and subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable, with only dividend income recognised through profit and loss. initial fair value is acquisition cost including transaction costs. upon disposal of the investment, the accumulated fair value changes in equity are not recycled to the income statement but instead, are reclassified from the fair value reserve to retained earnings. the fair value of energy shareholdings is a level 3 measure in the fair value measurement hierarchy. key estimates and judgements fair valuation and sensitivity valuation of energy shareholdings requires management’s assumptions and estimates of a number of factors that may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset. fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis and the main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends and discount rates. changes in regulatory environment or taxation may also have an impact on the value of the energy generating assets. the valuation process is carried out by upm energy and the results are reviewed by management. the electricity price estimate is based on future electricity forward prices and a simulation of the finnish area electricity price. a change of 5% in the electricity price used in the model would change the total value of the assets by eur 250 (180) million. the discount rate of 8.07% (8.01%) used in the valuation model is determined using the weighted average cost of capital method. a change of 0.5% percentage points in the discount rate would change the estimated fair value of the assets by approximately eur 180 (100) million. one of the main factors in the decrease in fair value during reporting period was the decrease in electricity forward market prices. additionally, market price volatility’s impact on the value of hydropower assets has been updated, increasing the fair value of hydropower assets. upm annual report 2024 284 285 upm annual report 2024 governance we are upm

indefinite life were carried out in the fourth quarter 2024. water rights of hydropower plants belonging to upm energy and reported in intangible rights amounted eur 189 million at the end of 2024 and 2023. the values of water rights were tested based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydro power plant. the impairment test of water rights did not result in a recognition of any impairment in 2024 and 2023. goodwill impairment tests were carried out for pulp operations in finland and uruguay, belonging to the upm fibres business area, upm raflatac business area, upm plywood business area and upm biochemicals business in other operations. in 2024, the weakened pulp market and high wood costs have negatively affected the performance outlook of pulp operations in finland compared to previous estimates. as a result of the impairment test calculation, upm impaired the entire goodwill of eur 113 million. no other assets than goodwill was impaired. upm biochemicals cgu includes assets of leuna biorefinery, which is the first of its kind new technology-based plant. the increased costs from the initial investment estimate and the construction delays indicated that the carrying amount of cgu may no longer be fully recoverable. as a result of the impairment test calculation conducted in december 2024, upm impaired the entire goodwill of eur 5 million and eur 373 million of other assets. the remaining book value of the refinery closely aligns with the estimated cost of constructing a comparable plant in the current economic environment. refer note 4.1 property, plant and equipment. the recoverable amount of cgus was estimated based on value in use calculations. the basis for valuation and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing are summarised in the below table: cash generating unit basis of valuation period of forecast pre-tax discount rate key assumptions pulp operations finland value in use 10 years + terminal value 10.55 % (2023: 10.68%) pulp price, wood costs pulp operations uruguay value in use 10 years + terminal value 9.12% (2023: 9.61%) pulp price, wood costs upm raflatac value in use 10 years + terminal value

terminal value 9.69% (2023: 10.20%) product prices, cost development sensitivity analyses the sensitivity analyses of goodwill impairment tests indicate that no reasonable change in key assumptions would result in recognition of impairment loss against goodwill. in pulp operations uruguay, the recoverable amount is most sensitive to pulp sales prices. key estimates and judgements the group’s assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life assets requires significant judgement. while management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and operational conditions. actual cash flows could therefore vary from estimated discounted future cash flows and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods. future cash flows the review of recoverable amount for goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using management projections of future cash flows. the most important assessments and assumptions needed in calculations are forecasts for future growth rates for the business in question, product prices, cost development and the discount rates applied. the group is using mainly ten-year forecasts in calculations as the nature of the group’s business is long term, due to its capital intensity, and is exposed to cyclical changes. for upm biochemicals, the group used five-year forecasts in calculations due to different maturity level of the business. in estimates of product prices and cost development, forecasts prepared by management for the next three years and estimates made for the following two to seven years are taken into consideration. in addition, consideration is given to the investment decisions made by the group as well as the profitability programmes that the group has implemented and the views of knowledgeable industry experts on the long-term development of demand and prices. in the projection of cash flows upm uses ebitda adjusted with cash flows not captured within ebitda, including working capital movements and capital expenditures. an assumed terminal value is based on a ebitda multiples six times, except for upm biochemicals for which perpetuity value is determined using inflation based 2% growth rate. discount rate the discount rate is estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (wacc) on the calculation date adjusted for risks specific to the business in question. the adjusted after-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each cash generating unit (cgu) based on the specific tax rate applicable to where the cgu operates. accounting policies goodwill goodwill arises in connection with business combinations where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets. goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment and is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies from the business combination. intangible rights intangible rights include water rights of hydropower plants, patents, licences, intellectual property and similar rights. water rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as the company has a contractual right to exploit water resources in the energy production of power plants. upm annual report 2024 286 287 upm annual report 2024 governance we are upm accounts and performance auditor's report sustainability

"the values of water rights are tested annually for impairment based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydropower plant. other intangible rights are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years. software and other intangible assets research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. costs incurred in acquiring software that will contribute to future period financial benefit are capitalised to software and systems. other intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years. impairment testing goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. for goodwill impairment testing purposes the group identifies its cash-generating units (cgus), which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. each cgu is no larger than a business area. the carrying amount for the cgu includes goodwill, non-current assets and working capital. if the balance sheet carrying amount of the cgu unit exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit. an impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount of the asset is less than the carrying amount. the carrying amount of the asset is then reduced to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset’s net selling price and its value in use. 4.5 provisions eurm

recent years including mill closures and profit improvement programmes. restructuring provisions recognised include various restructuring activities including dismantling costs. termination provisions include severance payments, unemployment compensations or other arrangements for employees leaving the company. in finland, termination provisions include also unemployment arrangements and disability pensions. unemployment provisions in finland are recognised 2–3 years before the granting and settlement of the compensation. at 31 december 2024 and 2023, restructuring and termination provisions relate mainly to capacity closures and optimisation of operations in upm communication papers business area. in 2024, additions to restructuring and termination provisions of eur 71 million relate to closures of hürth newsprint mill and nordland fine paper machine 3 and the planned closure of raflatac kaltenkirchen factory. in 2023, additions to restructuring and termination provisions of eur 143 million relate to the closure of upm plattling paper mill and paper machine 6 at upm schongau paper mill. the group recognises provisions for normal environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred in a future period upon a removal of non-current assets and restoring industrial landfills where a legal or constructive obligation exists. other provisions mainly include other short-term obligations related to emission rights. provisions for emissions include liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights. the group possesses emission rights amounting to eur 264 million (256 million) as intangible assets. » refer note 2.3 operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights. accounting policies a provision is recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated. provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current). restructuring and termination provisions a restructuring provisions is recognised when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when the plan has been communicated to those who are affected. employee termination provisions are recognised when the group has communicated the plan to the employees. environmental provisions environmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed. the recognition of environmental provisions is based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations. such provisions are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located. the amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. a corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised and subsequently depreciated as part of the asset. provisions do not include any third-party recoveries. emission provisions emission obligations are recognised in provisions based on realised emissions. the provision is measured at the carrying amounts of the corresponding emission rights held, which are recognised as intangible assets. in case of deficit in emission rights, the shortage is valued at the market value at the balance sheet date. key estimates and judgements environmental provisions the estimates used in determining the provisions are based on the expenses incurred for similar activities in the current reporting period taking into account the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account of any such changes. the discount rate applied is reviewed annually. the group aims to operate in compliance with regulations related to the treatment of waste water, air emissions and landfill sites. however, expected events during production processes and waste treatment could cause material losses and additional costs in the group’s operations. legal contingencies management judgement is required in measurement and recognition of provisions related to pending litigation. provisions are recorded when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past event, an unfavourable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. due to inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the actual losses may differ significantly from the originally estimated provision. » refer note 9.2 litigation for details of legal contingencies. 4.6 working capital the group defines operating working capital as inventories, trade receivables, trade payables and advances received which are presented separately below. the performance obligations related to advances received are typically fulfilled within 12

"4.1.2.2.1 introduction the topic of pollution is essential for the planet and the existence of all living beings. it takes various forms, such as air, water, or soil pollution. beyond the conventional pollutants, the development of human activities and the increasing vigilance with regard to pollution have raised awareness of the existence of new pollutants, which have only started to be analyzed and measured recently, such as microplastics, endocrine disruptors or pfas (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). the topic of pollution is therefore diverse and concerns a high number of substances, the list of which continues to grow as studies are conducted. hazardous waste occupies a special place among the potential sources of pollution, and the veolia group is particularly involved in its treatment. this type of waste is subject to numerous regulations, in an increasingly strict framework to regulate its handling and treatment: ■in all areas of the world where veolia operates, a local regulatory framework defines the qualification of hazardous waste as well as the methods of traceability, transportation, treatment and disposal; ■these national regulations are supplemented in particular by the international conventions of basel (1989), rotterdam (1998), stockholm (2001), minamata (2013), and montreal (1987); sustainability sustainability statement 204 veolia environnement / universal registration document 2024"

"impacts, risks and opportunities were assessed during workshops organized jointly by the risk management department and the sustainable development department, as described in section 4.1.3.3, “material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model”, page 200. during these workshops, internal contributors identified and assessed impacts, risks and opportunities (iros) according to the methodology described in section 4.1.4.1 “processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities”, page 201. as valeo has not identified any affected population within the scope of its activities, the group has not carried out stakeholder consultations with specific communities. [esrs 2 mdr – a§69] initiatives related to iros of the esrs e2 topical standards are often integrated into broader action plans. however, valeo does not always have the data granularity required to track current and future resources allocated to each action (bp 2). 4.2.4.2 policies related to pollution (dr e2-1) [esrs e2-1 § 12 à 15] some of valeo’s activities use chemical substances that may be harmful to the environment, biodiversity and human health, and generate hazardous waste. they generate effluents that may contain such substances as oil, heavy metals or suspended solids. the risk to the group arises from the failure to control the use of certain substances, the polluting nature of the resulting discharges and effluents, and the management of its hazardous waste. the group must be exemplary in its management of chemical substances at each stage of their use cycle in order to avoid any risk of pollution of the natural environment. each site must ensure, through regulatory monitoring, that its processes and the substances it uses always comply with local environmental regulations each site must also prevent the risk of pollution resulting from an industrial accident. the main causes to be averted are: • non-compliance of discharges; • aging of internal processing equipment; • the absence of treatment stations on site or externally; • poorly managed waste treatment channels; • the tightening of regulations in force. the risk may also be aggravated by late detection of discharges into the environment due to a lack or absence of: • periodic checks of storage facilities; • periodic checks of the discharge treatment process; • intervention and control policy in respect of environmental accidents. • a firewater retention area. to prevent the risk of pollution across all sites, the group has adopted several operational environmental directives setting rules for all sites, on the following issues: • effluents; • intervention means and consequence limitations; • the management of underground tanks; • waste management; • soil and groundwater management. all pollution risks are addressed by the group’s environmental policy (see section 4.2.1 “environmental policies and commitments”, page 205), which describes the standards and iso 14001 reference framework on which it is based and includes the following subjects: pollution of air valeo’s activities are liable to generate emissions into air that could affect the environment and human health. such emissions must be tightly controlled and monitored to avoid any risk of pollution. the group aims to limit the level of risk at each site through the following measures: • maintaining an up-to-date inventory of its emissions into air; • reducing chemical emissions into air; • controlling personal exposure limits; • implementing a monitoring plan for its regulated emissions. each site must establish a system to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements on emissions into air. in addition to complying with local regulations, the group’s guidelines require that the best available solutions be shared across all sites. each site establishes an inventory of its emissions as follows: • listing the sources of emissions into air, taking all of the site’s processes and activities into consideration; • listing facilities for the treatment of these emissions; • describing emissions based on their origin (emissions from combustion plants or production processes); • quantifying emissions in order to determine whether operating permits need to be obtained in accordance with applicable regulations. each valeo site assesses, particularly whenever any production processes are changed, potential ways of reducing atmospheric emissions of pollutants at source, focusing primarily on processes that do not require the installation of emission treatment facilities. the group monitors atmospheric emissions related to its activities and recommends a calculation method for indicators of emissions of volatile organic compounds (vocs), nitrogen oxides (nox), refrigerant gases and heavy metals such as lead (pb). the monitoring of emissions related to combustion (sulfur oxide (sox), covnm, pm10) is not applicable, as equipment mainly uses natural gas, which emits very little of these elements during combustion. valeo applies the policy to all its plants and r&d centers. the hse department is responsible for its implementation. to monitor the effectiveness of its policy, valeo collects the quantities emitted each year using a reporting tool based on the sites’ declarations. these data are evaluated by internal and external audits in accordance with group guidelines and local regulations. in addition, sites are subject to regular management system audits. this policy complements the group’s policies and standards, local, national and international regulations, the monitoring of operating bylaws and specific air emission limitations in the plant’s operating permit. sustainability report environmental information universal registration document valeo 2024 237"
"4.2.4.3 actions and resources related to pollution (dr e2-2) [esrs e2 § 19] pollution of air as part of its air pollution control policy, valeo took the following key actions in 2024 at all plants and r&d centers to prevent and/or reduce pollution risks: • volatile organic compounds (vocs): improvement of reporting processes through systematic consideration of inputs through the production management system. valeo is committed to reducing vocs through the use of purification systems, such as dry filters or chemical processes. incineration is no longer preferred, in order to reduce co2 emissions; • refrigerants: improvement of data reliability; • lead emissions: valeo continues its work to eradicate lead. today, the use of lead is limited to soldering flux in end-of-life products. to reduce inputs (avoidance), this type of welding is no longer authorized for new projects. valeo has observed the following results of these actions: • emissions of combustion pollutants: based on the list defined in annex ii of the iepr, only nitrogen dioxide (nox) exceeds reporting thresholds. other pollutants have also been quantified and are below the relevant thresholds. in the short term, the following actions are planned for all industrial sites and r&d centers: • vocs: • installation of purification systems that go beyond the requirements of national and local regulations. the group aims to make voc-free products the norm where this is compatible with achieving quality objectives; • improvement of calculation methodologies; • refrigerants: • in 2025, the group intends to change the method used to calculate its refrigerant emissions in order to reflect actual ghg emissions by moving from estimates to physical data (declaration of refrigerant charge volumes); • quantification of investments required to replace the most polluting gases and their implementation; • combustion: • identification of investments in line with the cap 50 plan to move away from fossil fuel-based energy sources or towards less polluting fuels (e.g., substituting of heavy oil with natural gas). sustainability report environmental information universal registration document valeo 2024 239 (1) chemical abstracts service (cas)."

[esrs 2 mdr – a§69] initiatives related to iros of the esrs e3 topical standards are often integrated into broader action plans. however, valeo does not always have the data granularity required to track current and future resources allocated to each action (bp 2). based on an analysis conducted in 2021 with an external consultant, the list of sites exposed to the risk of water stress, or even to risks of water restrictions, water shortages or water cuts by 2030, 2040 and 2050 has been updated. it is based on two ipcc global warming scenarios, ssp2 4.5 and ssp5 8.5, reasonably optimistic and reasonably pessimistic respectively (see section 4.2.3.3.1 “analysis of physical and transition risks”, paragraph “physical risks – analysis methodology”, page 219). given the importance of this resource, the group aims to limit withdrawals, control its water consumption, and ensure the supply of good quality water for its staff. due to their geographic location, some valeo sites may be exposed to water cuts or restrictions resulting from: • a municipal/regional decision in the event of a drought; • a shortage of water sources supplying the site (public network, groundwater); • poor water quality (wells, groundwater); • a restriction imposed by local authorities in the event of overconsumption; • the lack of a water recovery system; • the absence of internal treatment and recycling; • the absence of a closed-loop water circuit. the main water-related risk factors are coastal flooding, river flooding and water stress. data are from aqueduct (wri(1)), from jba), with a resolution of less than 1 km, and demand and supply are assessed using the iiasa(2) water futures and solutions (wfas) and isimip(3) models. in addition, all existing and newly acquired valeo sites are subject to analysis by a specialized external firm. this water-related due diligence covers the following risk metrics: wastewater discharge, impact on soil and groundwater, site location and surrounding land use, site utilities (including water supply and network, wastewater discharge and treatment, rainwater discharge and drainage, fire protection facilities and water supply), hydrology and hydrogeology (including surface watercourses closest to the site, national water quality standard and shallow groundwater). each year, valeo assesses its suppliers’ sustainability practices through a self-assessment questionnaire that includes a section on water management (see section 4.4.4 “responsible purchasing”, page 293). [esrs e3 § 8] due to the location of the group’s sites and the nature of its activities, water consumption and discharges have not impacted local communities to date. 4.2.5.2 policies related to water (dr e3-1) the risk of water stress is increasing in many geographic areas relative to the local capacity to renew water reserves due to: • changes in global water demand (particularly in the united states, china and india); • the effects of global warming. under the impetus of the group health, safety and environment (hse) director, valeo applies the following water management policy to all its activities, sites, employees and subcontractors: • performance of an environmental risk assessment before any acquisition or leasing of land or buildings, notably to determine the potential level of water stress of the future site locations; • preparation of a water supply and distribution network plan, identifying its isolation systems, backflow preventers and meters, distinguishing between domestic and industrial uses and uses for firefighting and drinking water. with regard to drinking water, the site must, where possible, be supplied from an external source (preferably the public network) and be protected against the risk of contamination by other networks; • encouragement of the use of non-drinking water wherever possible (toilets, irrigation, cleaning, firefighting, etc.); • installation of systems for determining the volume of water consumed by use (domestic, industrial, firefighting) for each water supply source; • completion of water cycle studies to fine-tune the identification of water losses related to processes, evaporation or water leaks in pipes; • work to prevent leaks attributable to aging equipment; • development of on-site water treatment processes to recover and reuse water internally; • rainwater collection. however, events such as local restrictions due to heat waves, scarcity of water sources or poor water quality can affect access to water resources, which is why it is so important for many of the group’s sites to reduce not only their consumption but also the absolute amount of water they withdraw. the valeo 4r circular economy program designs products and services to minimize water consumption and to treat and recycle industrial water internally. sustainability report environmental information universal registration document valeo 2024 245 (1) word resources institute (wri): environmental research organization.

"methodological details and definitions of metrics the amount of water consumed is determined by the amount of water withdrawn and the amount of water discharged, with or without treatment, in accordance with the expectations of esrs e3-4. water withdrawals include water from the public supply network, groundwater, surface water and rainwater collected on all valeo group sites. the measurement of water discharge was added to the reporting process in 2023 and includes water discharged to third parties or into a natural environment. calculations of water consumption, discharges and withdrawals are based on actual data. water consumption is calculated by subtracting water discharges from water withdrawals. to obtain a breakdown of the various metrics for areas of high- and extremely high-water stress, sites were classified using the wri aqueduct v4 tool. the group records the amount of water treated on-site, recycled and reused in production. stored water has been deliberately excluded from metrics as it represents immaterial volumes (firewater). water intensity is measured using two numerators: • water consumption in accordance with esrs e3-4; • water withdrawal to provide data comparable with those observed in previous reference periods. [esrs e3 § 28] for withdrawals, 100% of data is from actual measurements. for water discharges, 40% of data is from actual discharge measurements, and 60% from estimates. 4.2.5.6 anticipated financial effects from water-related impacts, risks and opportunities (dr e3-5) the csrd allows companies to omit the information prescribed by esrs e3-5 for the first year of preparation of its sustainability statement. for its first year of publication, valeo has elected to activate the phase-in clause and not to report data on its anticipated financial effects from water-related impacts, risks and opportunities. to date, the group's water-related operating expenses and capital expenditure are not automatically identifiable in its accounting systems. valeo is therefore unable to report this information in respect of 2024. however, a process for identifying these opex and capex will be implemented in 2025. 4.2.6 biodiversity (esrs e4) 4.2.6.1 transition plan and consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in strategy and business model (dr e4-1) [esrs e4 § 13] at this stage, the group has not conducted a resilience analysis of its strategy and economic model in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems, as it does not have a direct dependence on natural resources that could be affected by systemic, physical and transition risks related to biodiversity and ecosystems.

"4.2.6.4 “policies related to biodiversity”, page 250). valeo’s commitment to protect biodiversity is further demonstrated by the environmental compliance analyses carried out at its sites and specifically on the group’s new acquisitions. in the event of proven damage to biodiversity and ecosystems, valeo has implemented appropriate restoration measures. minimum safeguards with regard to the minimum safeguards set out in the taxonomy regulation, valeo has longstanding policies and tools that enable it to meet requirements in respect of: • human rights, through the existence of adequate policies and risk management, supported by dedicated tools, such as internal and external whistleblowing procedures for its employees and suppliers, together with a package of sanctions. in 2024, valeo was not subject to any convictions relating to a breach of its duty of care policies in terms of human rights; • corruption, through the existence of policies and a risk management approach; • taxation, through the existence of a tax policy based on taxation in the country of production; • compliance with competition laws, through the existence of a set of anti-fraud and anti-corruption training programs that are updated annually and mandatory for the entire population exposed to this risk. thanks to its internal procedures, risk management policy and the absence of disputes relating to the minimum safeguards, valeo can declare its products meet the minimum safeguards provision of the taxonomy. sustainability report environmental information universal registration document valeo 2024 211 (1) see sustainable development glossary, page 341."
"4.2.6.4 policies related to biodiversity (dr e4-2) [esrs e4 § 23] at this stage of the analysis initiated in 2024, described in section 4.2.6.5 “actions and resources dedicated to biodiversity”, page 250), the group is not aware of: • significant impacts on biodiversity and shared ecosystems resulting from its activities: • material impacts on biodiversity and shared ecosystems resulting from its activities, • social consequences of biodiversity and ecosystem-related impacts caused directly by its activities. a more detailed and substantiated analysis will be carried out in 2025 with an external expert in the field. [esrs e4 § 24] almost all of the sites occupied by valeo, i.e., nearly 90% of its production sites, are located in urban areas or areas zoned for industrial use, and the remaining 10% are located in agricultural or natural areas. in any event, its activities are not liable to significantly alter ecological processes (no extraction or spraying, for instance). however, to gain a more accurate understanding of its potential impacts, the group conducts an annual inventory of sites located in or near (within 10 km) protected areas, and has carried out an analysis of the impacts and dependencies, and the resulting risks and dependencies, within the value chain. as part of their iso 14001 environmental management system and the group “biodiversity” directive, which sets out guidelines for biodiversity protection practices during the selection, development and closure phases of plants, all plants and r&d centers implement preventive measures, notably to address the issues of land-use change and pollution, as well as material direct impacts on biodiversity, which may be identified where appropriate through due diligence audits at site level. prior to the acquisition or leasing of land or buildings, a study is conducted to identify and list protected areas and species in order to maintain ecosystem conditions. under no circumstances should a site development or expansion project be directly responsible for the disappearance of a forest or wetland, or for the disappearance of a protected species or its habitat. all such projects must therefore be sited away from protected areas. measures are taken from the site design stage to preserve local biodiversity. during the operational phase, the site takes measures to maintain or improve arrangements made to maintain or improve biodiversity when the site was developed. valeo is also committed to promoting sites’ biodiversity initiatives with a view to extend them to all sites: • recovery and reuse of food waste to make compost and supply neighboring farms; • elimination of the use of phytosanitary products; • tightened audit of the storage of chemical products; • reduction in the consumption and discharge of heavy metals. finally, site closures must not result in biodiversity loss. with respect to its value chain, the group has been assessing its main suppliers as regards their biodiversity practices since 2023 (see section 4.4.4 “responsible purchasing”, page 293). the group aims to progressively strengthen its biodiversity and ecosystem protection policy with respect to upstream players in its value chain. valeo has used the encore tool to identify its key upstream raw materials. this analysis takes into account the five major pressures on biodiversity. the group addresses indirect policies that may affect biodiversity in the sections dedicated to esrs e1, e2, e3 and e5. most direct suppliers are not highly material. valeo is in the process of constructing a plan aimed at improving the maturity of tier n suppliers in the value chain in terms of their understanding of their impacts. in addition, as part of the cap 50 transition plan, the share of biosourced materials is set to increase, particularly bioplastics. valeo therefore aims to include measures to manage the impacts and dependencies related to the supply of natural resources in its duty-of-care plan, notably to ensure that biosourced materials do not put pressure on biomes, by changing land use for instance. valeo also aims to involve actors in its ecosystem, particularly in the areas of mineral extraction and electronics (see section 4.4.4 “responsible purchasing”, page 293). 4.2.6.5 actions and resources dedicated to biodiversity (dr e4-3) [esrs e4 § 25] - [esrs e4 § 27] - [esrs e4 § 28] to assess its impact on biodiversity, valeo has implemented the leap approach recommended by the tnfd (1). locate the group has begun an inventory of sites located near (within 10 km) protected areas using the database made available by the key biodiversity areas (kba) program. for each site identified, the iucn classification of the species present within the perimeter was analyzed, and sites in the vicinity of “endangered” or “critically endangered” species were included in a list of “sites of interest for biodiversity”. from this list, five sites with a listed species within a perimeter of less than 1 km were identified as “biodiversity priority sites”. the inventory is updated annually to take account of changes in locations, and in kba and iucn data. at the same time, valeo is looking to identify the areas of its value chain that interface with biodiversity, highlighting the most affected raw materials. a more detailed and substantiated analysis will be carried out in 2025 with an external expert in the field. evaluate valeo’s activities are not likely to significantly alter ecological processes, nor are they dependent on biodiversity. the group has assessed the impacts of its priority sites against the five ipbes pressures and the wwf biodiversity risk filter, using data from the encore database for the auto parts & equipment activity. the “pressure on biodiversity” impact was found to be of low materiality for all sites of interest for biodiversity. for all the group’s activities, the dependencies assessed by the wwf biodiversity risk filter are either immaterial or covered by an existing policy (water, pollution, waste). sustainability report environmental information 250 universal registration document valeo 2024 (1) tnfd: taskforce on nature-related financial disclosures, a working group created by the financial stability board to promote financial transparency with regard to the risks and opportunities related to biodiversity and companies’ dependence on nature"

"78 assa abloy | annual report 2024 task force on climate-related financial disclosures in 2024, assa abloy continued to explore and understand the requirements of the tcfd. we are gradually developing the process of reporting to the tcfd, to ensure it is meaningful and helpful in guiding our organization to make informed decisions based on climate-related risk and opportunity. we are firmly convinced the tcfd framework will enable us to identify and navigate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. we carried out our third climate scenario analysis during the year. the analysis reviewed the risks and opportunities of market and technology, reputation, policy and regulation, and physical risks, to 2030 and 2050. the two different climate scenarios we reviewed were developed by the un international panel on climate control (ipcc): rcp 6 and rcp 2.6. the two scenario analyses were used to identify and assess transition risks and opportunities over the short and medium term to 2030, as well as the long- term to 2050. rcp 2.6, called realizing the paris agreement, is a scenario where emissions decline rapidly over the coming decades, resulting in a temperature increase up to 2.3°c warmer by the end of the century. rcp 6, called the rocky road, is a scenario where emissions are declining at an insufficient rate and not to the level required, resulting in a temperature in­ crease up to 3.7°c warmer by the end of the century. scenario analysis during the scenario analysis we added more context, where we tried to understand both the qualitative and quantitative aspects, especially for climate-relat­ ed risk. we developed the process to be able to quan­ tify our climate-related risk, in terms of percentage of sales from low risk to very high risk. depending on the level of risk (from low to very high), the financial risk is then determined as percentage impact on total annu­ al sales. the analysis reviewed risks and opportunities relating to two different climate scenarios and how they could impact assa abloy’s business in 2030 and 2050. the outcomes are summarized in the blocks to the right. the rocky road – rcp 6 temperature increases between 2 – 3.7°c increased extreme weather events fossil fuel-generated energy, poor air quality forced migration increased areas of water stress ocean levels rising opportunities/risks as a % of annual sales low <1 % medium 2–5% high 6–10% very high is >10% opportunities • producing locally, a competitive advantage • increased solution requirements • technology will be a solution enabler • new markets • increased focus on security risks: physical risk (pr), transition risk (tr) • coastal factories at risk of flooding (pr) • supply chain uncertainty (tr) • materials availability (tr) • customer expectation (tr) • ability to get insurance (tr) • higher costs for emissions (tr) realizing the paris agreement – rcp 2.6 temperature increases between 0.9 – 2.3°c lower frequency of extreme weather events large-scale installed renewable energy robust energy legislation and carbon taxes high energy effectiveness and efficiency opportunities • new solutions reducing customers’ environmental footprint • transition to circular economy • local production will be an advantage • increased resource efficiency risks: physical risk (pr), transition risk (tr) • availability of low-carbon materials (tr) • need to upgrade and retrofit older sites (pr & tr) • carbon taxes and market regulations (tr) • customer expectation (tr) • m&a in higher risk geographies (tr) • energy quality and availability (tr) sustainability statement | report of the board of directors"

"87 assa abloy | annual report 2024 sustainability statement | report of the board of directors emphasizing that almost the entire reduction is due to a change in methodology and not actual reduc­ tions. further, it is important to understand that the methodology is, despite being far more accurate than previously, still based on assumptions and simplifi­ cations in certain places and the emissions may still go up or down when even more accurate data will be available. another important aspect to raise is the fact that even if we base the emission calculation on actual item weight or actual material information, this information is often not verified and could theo­ retically be incorrect. we believe our suppliers have a thorough understanding and correct data regarding the items they sell to us. although we use a science-based and data driven approach, there is a degree of uncertainty where estimates are utilized. this presents a risk to the ac­ curacy of our scope 3 footprint. we are continuously working to improve our data accuracy across our scope 3 categories, while benchmarking with other complex organizations. we will also stay abreast of the development of the new ghg protocol scope 3 carbon accounting standard, which is due for release in 2026, to ensure our methodology is aligned. assa abloy has included 100 percent of subsidi­ aries' emissions under operational or financial in the target boundary, as required per the ghg protocol corporate standard; which has been verified and ratified by the science based targets initiative. assa abloy does not have any significant joint ventures. our scope 3 data has been restated to include ac­ quisitions, where the data is available. our scope 1 & 2 data will be restated to include acquisitions during 2025. we anticipate the inclusion of hardware and home improvement (hhi) will have a material impact on our baseline across all three emission scopes, when the data becomes available for us to restate. we do not anticipate significant risk or impact from acquisitions made in 2024. our scope 1 emissions are generated from energy burned on site in our operations such as oil and gas, co2eq from industrial processes and fleet emissions. reported normalized kpis are based on cur­ rency-neutral monetary values and value added rather than sales – to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations and the ongoing restructuring of the group. as a result, value added for intensity met­ rics is restated each year. by using value added as a measure, the normalized values are also not affected by the outsourcing of manufacturing. we believe this provides a more accurate picture of what is going on in the group. electricity emission factors are based on data on electricity production for 2010, as published by the international energy agency (iea, 2012). these emission factors are used for calculation of emissions until end of 2016. in 2017 and again in 2024 assa abloy updated the emission factors used to calculate greenhouse gases from electricity consumption. the emission factors are based on the most recent data published by the iea and the international panel on climate change (ipcc), and are expressed in co2 equivalents (co2 eq). our transition plan to realize our long-term climate commitment is approved by the board of directors, our highest governing body with overall responsibility for sustainability. sustainability is part of everything we do and is or­ ganically integrated into our overall business strategy; the transition plan is aligned to our business strategy and financial plans. the progress towards our transi­ tion plan can be seen in our carbon data table e1-6 gross scopes 1, 2, 3 and total ghg emissions on page 89. we have excluded scope 3 categories that are not relevant to our organization; for example, upstream/ downstream leased assets, as well as excluding categories which represent less than 0.2 percent of scope 3, for example, capital goods, as approved by the science based targets initiative. assa abloy is not taking any other actions besides that to mitigate negative effects on the environment and/or affected communities. we are working towards using primary data from suppliers, though to date we do not utilize primary data. we do not have a carbon pricing scheme at assa abloy. we do not have carbon removal projects in place and do not utilize carbon credits or offsets. there are no changes in target and corresponding metrics or underlying measurement methodologies, significant assumptions, limitations, sources and adopted pro­ cesses to collect data."

"70 assa abloy | annual report 2024 sustainability statement | report of the board of directors double materiality assessment methodology we followed the steps outlined by the esrs to conduct our double materiality assessment: 1. stakeholder engagement: we conducted stakeholder surveys with over 500 stakeholders to understand the concerns and priorities of various stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and ngos. 2. materiality workshops: we carried out work­ shops to discuss both impact materiality (the sig­ nificance of the social and environmental impact of the company) and financial materiality (the importance of sustainability issues to enterprise value). 3. preliminary findings: we compiled the prelim­ inary results from the workshops and surveys to identify the sustainability matters that are materi­ al to the company. 4. validation process: we established a verification team made up of function heads and subject mat­ ter experts to validate the preliminary findings, where feedback was collected and incorporated. 5. reporting: our sustainability statement and an­ nual report have been prepared in alignment with the csrd reporting metrics and requirements, ensuring that it includes the updated materiality analysis. 6. continuous improvement: we will use the outcomes of the materiality assessment to continuously improve sustainability practices and reporting. process steps – impact materiality we followed the five process steps for impact materiality as defined by the csrd: 1. engagement of stakeholders: we engaged internal subject matter experts, representatives from each division and all functional heads across the group to attend and provide input during the impact materiality workshop. we ran a series of education and awareness sessions before the impact materiality workshop with all internal stakeholders to bring them up to speed on what disclosing to csrd would entail. we developed a standardized survey for our wider stakeholders and received over 500 responses from stakehold­ ers; including employees, customers, suppliers, investors, industry associations and ngos. the output from the stakeholders was aggregated into focus areas to ensure the stakeholder input from the surveys was taken into account during the impact materiality workshop. 2. scoping of impacts: we reviewed our previous materiality assessments and sustainability focus areas as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant topics. this provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the csrd. 3. assessment of individual impacts: as outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each impact, considering factors such as scale, scope, irremediability and likelihood. 4. calibration of material impacts: we used the in­ put from our stakeholder surveys, internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. this ensured that the identi­ fied material topics are relevant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. stakeholder and management review: the findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our executive team and the board of directors. this step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects assa abloy’s sus­ tainability impacts and material issues. this result­ ed in the identification of fifteen negative impact material sub-topics. the findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or group strategy. our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to csrd as well as progress towards our sustainabili­ ty goals and objectives. process steps – financial materiality we followed the five process steps for financial materiality as defined by the csrd: 1. engagement of stakeholders: we engaged internal subject matter experts, including risk management and all functional heads across the group to attend and provide their input during the financial materiality workshop. 2. scoping of impacts: we reviewed our previous disclosures to tcfd and scenario analyses as a reference point, to determine if we have been addressing the materially relevant financial topics. this provided a stable foundation to build upon, factoring in the additionality required by the csrd. 3. assessment of individual impacts: as outlined earlier in the report we evaluated the significance of each risk, considering factors such as likelihood and magnitude. 4. calibration of material impacts: we used the input from our internal subject matter experts and functional heads to assess and verify the outcome from the double materiality assessment process. this ensured the identified material topics are rel­ evant and there were no gaps or missed relevant topics. 5. stakeholder and management review: the findings from our double materiality assessment process were presented to our executive team and the board of directors. this step ensured that the assessment accurately reflects assa abloy ́s sustainability impacts and material issues. this resulted in the identification of twelve financial material sub-topics. the findings from our double materiality assessment process were assessed with our existing business model and group strategy, where it was clear there are no wholesale changes required for either our business model or group strategy. our current business model and strategy are sufficient to ensure we can disclose to all csrd minimum disclosure requirements (mdr) as well as progress towards our sustainabil­ ity goals and objectives."

"214 terna s.p.a. and terna group | 2024 annual report the control model for sustainability statement is methodologically based on the framework developed by the committee of sponsoring organisations of the treadway commission (so-called ‘coso report’), which, in march 2023, published a specific supplementary guide dedicated to sustainability reporting, entitled ‘achieving effective internal control of sustainability reporting (icsr)’. consistent with the principles of the coso report, the sciis management process is structured into the following main phases: • scoping; • analysis of risks and controls; • monitoring; • assessment and reporting. the identification of the areas of greatest risk for the sustainability statement is carried out as part of the scoping phase through a risk/materiality analysis of the data (kpis) included in the terna group’s consolidated sustainability statement, based on assessment drivers that take into account endogenous and exogenous risk factors. for the kpis assessed to be of higher risk/materiality and for the group companies that contribute significantly to them, an additional risk analysis is carried out, according to a top-down, risk-based approach, concerning the business processes from which these kpis originate. in particular, risk analysis at the process level consists of identifying events that may compromise the qualitative characteristics (relevance, faithful representation, comparability, verifiability and understandability) that the data and information presented in the consolidated sustainability statement prepared in accordance with the esrs standards must fulfil. in this area, the assessments carried out highlighted the following main categories of risk: (i) completeness and integrity of data; (ii) availability and timeliness of data; (iii) traceability of data; (iv) authorisation of data and information; and (v) compliance with relevant legislation. the following main types of controls are envisaged in order to properly monitor these risks: • approval and management review controls; • data reconciliation checks; • consistency checks of the consolidated sustainability statement with respect to the relevant esrs; • logical access controls and traceability of operations performed on the system used for the consolidated sustainability statement; • consistency checks by analysing the variance of data within the time series available. it should also be noted that the process of collecting and consolidating sustainability data and information and drafting the consolidated sustainability statement is supported by the use of an it application that represents a further integral risk mitigation factor that enables structured data collection flows, automatic controls and monitoring dashboards. a further general element of risk mitigation on consolidated sustainability statement is represented by the terna group’s ‘control environment’, consisting of the set of ‘ethical values’ and cultural values, the governance and organisational model, the leadership style exercised by senior management and management, and by the personnel management policies, aimed at establishing a general context designed to ensure that process activities are carried out and controlled in accordance with the principles and objectives defined by management. the sciis provides for a periodic assessment phase of the adequacy of the design and effective application of the controls of which it is composed. the results of these assessments are analysed and evaluated by management in order to define, where appropriate, corrective actions to be implemented in the relevant processes. in this context, a system of ‘chain’ certifications was implemented by terna’s management and the delegated administrative bodies of the consolidated other documents separate financial statements consolidated financial statements report on operations"
"232 terna s.p.a. and terna group | 2024 annual report climate change [esrs e1] strategy terna group’s decarbonisation process as italy’s national grid operator, terna plays a central role in italy’s energy transition process. its sustainability and decarbonisation strategy is not only required by global climate change objectives and italy’s international commitments; indeed, it marks a strategic choice that responds to a long-term vision, in which the electricity system becomes the main driver of energy transformation. the group has always operated with the aim of ensuring a safe, reliable and efficient electricity system, while reducing its environmental impact and actively contributing to combat climate change. over the years, terna group has adopted a series of concrete initiatives and strategic investments aimed at promoting environmental sustainability, ensuring efficient grid management and facilitating the integration of renewable energy into the system. by developing advanced technologies, digitalising infrastructures and adopting increasingly innovative operating models, the company is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, while contributing to the decarbonisation of the entire national electricity system. terna group’s sustainability strategy is built on solid foundations, based on a thorough understanding of its strategic role and its responsibility towards the environment and the community. the company has invested considerable resources in the modernisation of the transmission grid, in order to optimise the integration capacity of renewable energies and reduce grid losses, which are two key aspects for achieving national and european climate change objectives. the group has also developed and is currently developing innovative tools for smart grid management, exploiting the potential of new digital technologies and automation solutions to increase operational efficiency and improve the resilience of the electricity system. the adoption of sophisticated real-time monitoring and control systems optimises management of the energy flow, promoting a more effective use of available renewable sources and reducing the need for more polluting energy sources. these initiatives have contributed and still contribute directly to improving, year after year, the national production energy mix and the related co2 emission factor. at company level, this aspect is confirmed by the constant decrease in emissions associated with grid losses, which account for more than 90% of the group’s total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and which move in the same direction as the national emission factor, with the same grid losses (indeed, these emissions are the product of grid losses and the national emission factor, expected to be a zero factor thanks to the integration of renewables - and will correspond to zero grid loss emissions). in order to confirm its commitment to combating climate change, terna group has adopted scope 1 and scope 2 emission reduction targets in line with the paris agreement’s trajectory, and a scope 3 emission reduction target, all validated and certified by the science based targets initiative (sbti), an internationally recognised framework for setting emission reduction targets in line with the latest scientific evidence. with respect to the scope 3 emission reduction target, the group is currently adjusting the scope of the target to bring it in line with the applicable legislation. the main initiatives implemented by the group to achieve these targets include, first and foremost, the above- mentioned capital expenditure to integrate renewable sources into the italian electricity system and the digitalisation of grid infrastructure, in addition to the optimisation of operating processes by adopting more efficient and sustainable technologies and improving the energy efficiency of its facilities. terna’s approach to decarbonisation is not limited solely to reducing its own direct emissions (scope 1 and scope 2). indeed, it also includes the commitment to reduce indirect emissions along the value chain (scope 3), through targeted engagement actions with suppliers, industrial partners and relevant stakeholders. with a view to constantly raise its ambition in combating climate change, when publishing the 2024-2028 industrial plan update in march 2025, the group officially announced its commitment to the science based targets initiative to define a net zero target within two years. e1-1 > other documents separate financial statements consolidated financial statements report on operations"

"242 terna s.p.a. and terna group | 2024 annual report the definition of the terna group’s ghg emissions reduction targets is based on the identification of its impacts in terms of climate change and on the analysis of the company’s environmental data, particularly with respect to ghg emissions. the relevant national and international targets are also considered, such as limiting global warming to 1.5°c as per 2015 paris climate conference. in this respect, terna group’s target related to climate change mitigation, specifically the reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions, was validated by sbti (science based target initiative) in 2022 and is therefore compatible with the above-mentioned limitation of global warming to 1.5°c. on the other hand, with respect to the target to reduce scope 3 ghg emissions, the group is currently redefining its targets in order to align them to the reporting boundary as intended by the csrd. furthermore, with a view to constantly raise its ambition in combating climate change, when publishing the 2024-2028 industrial plan update in march 2025, terna group officially announced its commitment to the science based targets initiative to define a net zero target to 2050 within two years. with respect to the fundamental assumptions behind the definition of terna group’s science-based target, as mentioned earlier, more than 90% of the group’s total scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are associated with grid losses, and the main lever for reducing these emissions is terna’s integration of renewable sources into the italian electricity system103. therefore, the definition of the target depends on the assumptions underlying the planning of grid development in line with the guidelines of the national integrated energy and climate plan (“pniec”), which applies the targets of the european “fit-for-55” and “repowereu” legislative packages at national level. in particular, the pniec sets national objectives for 2030 on energy efficiency, renewable sources and the reduction of co2 emissions, as well as objectives for energy security, interconnections, the single energy market and competitiveness, sustainable development and mobility, outlining for each of them the measures that will be implemented to ensure their achievement. for further information, reference should be made to the section describing the energy scenarios in the paragraph on the double materiality. when reporting ghg emissions reduction targets, the terna group combines scope 1 and scope 2 emissions104. as already discussed, the main reasons behind group’s emissions depend on the type of emissions. with respect to scope 1 emissions, these are mainly caused by the sf6 gas which is present in terna’s plants and whose leaks mainly affect equipment installed. on the other hand, scope 2 emissions are mainly attributable to grid losses, in addition to electricity consumption. the scope of the ghg emissions reduction target does not differ from that of the ghg emissions reported under the e1-6 disclosure requirement. furthermore, it should be noted that these are gross targets, meaning that the company does not include ghg removals, carbon credits, or avoided emissions among the means to achieve them. at all stages of its decision-making process, the terna group is committed to taking into account the opinions of its key stakeholders. this also applies when the group’s targets are defined, including those for reducing ghg emissions. indeed, the ongoing dialogue with stakeholders has enabled terna to set the group’s priorities in terms of climate change mitigation and adaption, has contributed to defining the related targets, and has supported the implementation of many initiatives aimed at combating climate change. for information on the business process for setting and updating the group’s targets, monitoring the related performance and the engagement of employees, see the section ‘2024 - 2028 sustainability plan update’. 103 see the section “actions in relation to climate change” for information on the link between these emissions and the decarbonisation of italy’s energy mix. 104 in the base year (2019), scope 1 emissions in relation to total scope 1 and scope 2 were 4% and scope 2 emissions were 96%. other documents separate financial statements consolidated financial statements report on operations"

"196 terna s.p.a. and terna group | 2024 annual report protecting biodiversity the interaction of the group’s activities with biodiversity is mainly related to the physical presence of power lines and electricity substations78 and their impact on the surrounding environment, which can be both natural and man-made. in particular, with reference to the construction phase of the works, great attention is paid to the choice of areas and access tracks, selected, when possible, in areas of lesser natural value. in the case of submarine power lines, the impacts concern the integrity of the seabed on which the undersea cables are laid. regarding laying and maintenance operations, the impacts primarily concern aquatic flora species such as, for example, posidonia oceanica. in this context, the search for the route constitutes the most delicate design phase as it determines the future impact on the environment and biodiversity of the entire development project. for this reason, terna, without prejudice to the need to identify a route that allows for the regular operation and maintenance of the power line, seeks design solutions that minimise the amount of land used, interference with areas of environmental, natural, landscape, and archaeological value whether urbanised or urban development areas, and the encumbrances on the properties involved79. the support of the gis technology (‘geographic information system’), is fundamental when searching for sustainable locations (corridors) for national transmission grid (ntg) development projects. this technology allows comprehensive consideration of all information relating to the different types of land use and protection obligations (territorial, naturalistic, cultural, landscape, etc.), in order to identify possible locations which are the most compatible with the area concerned. the interaction between terna lines and substations and protected areas or areas of natural interest is constantly monitored. therefore, all of the group’s assets are assessed with the support of gis technology, and overall, monitoring includes all substations (915 in 2024) and power lines (68,374 km in 2024). with the support of this database, it has been carried out an inventory of possible interferences between assets and protected area or areas of high biodiversity, cross-referencing data on the electricity grid with local data. (in 2024, there were 7,276.24 km of power lines and 34 electricity substations interfering with protected areas; for more details, see the tables on page 259, in the context of paragraph “metrics related to biodiversity protection”). considering that interventions in protected areas are reduced to a minimum by virtue of the application of erpa procedures, the mitigation measures required by legislation and ordered by local authorities are applied for new works. the double materiality assessment 2024 identified and considered the impacts that may collectively concern the group’s activities with respect to biodiversity, it was not deemed necessary to break down the impacts by specific sites. this detail is carried out following the requirements and environmental impact assessment for the implementation of the development plan. the double materiality assessment considered the direct and indirect impacts of terna’s activities on biodiversity and ecosystems, assessing both actual and potential impacts. starting from an analysis of internal and external corporate documents, also considering sector-specific guidelines of the task force on nature-related financial disclosures (tnfd), a series of impacts related to the topics and sub-topics indicated by the esrs standards were then identified. the identified impacts were submitted to the relevant corporate functions and external sustainability experts, who assessed their materiality based on the criteria of significance and likelihood. the contribution of the functions involved in the context of the double materiality assessment is of particular importance since they are responsible for ensuring ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders as a fundamental element of the preparatory activities for updating and implementing the development plan. the group is constantly committed to establishing and implementing the most efficient forms of engagement and participatory planning, with particular focus 78 for a list of sites, see the tables ‘details of power lines owned by the terna group’ and ‘details of electricity substations owned by the terna group’ on page 388. 79 terna’s planning includes the study of site plans aimed at using existing roads or tracks to minimise the opening of new tracks, especially in wooded or protected areas, and the assessment of problems related to cutting vegetation, adopting methodologies and tools to minimise interference such as optimising the height of supports and their location. agreement on location criteria is the instrument used for selecting local corridors with least impact. these criteria are used to identify the greater or lesser degree of suitability of an area to host new electricity infrastructure. terna and the regions have agreed on a system of erpa criteria (exclusion; repulsion; problems; attraction), based on four classes, to be adopted when locating new electrical works. protected areas, including the iucn (international union for the conservation of nature) categories that coincide with these, fall into the ‘repulsion’ category, which binds terna not to operate unless there are no alternatives or there are only alternatives that are even less environmentally compatible. e4 | sbm-3 > e4| iro-1 > other documents separate financial statements consolidated financial statements report on operations"

"to address these impacts and risks, finnair has established a saf working group dedicated to evaluating how finnair’s own operations and the operations of its upstream value chain impact biodiversity and ecosystems, with the objective of addressing these aspects of saf use as part of finnair’s saf strategy. finnair aims to align its strategy with the objectives of maintaining biodiversity and ecosystems at a healthy level, which is a prerequisite for the continuation of business operations. finnair continues to develop its processes in this area, involving stakeholders as appropriate, to ensure transparency for its impacts and to account for transitional and regulatory risk for operations. e4-2 policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems finnair’s environmental and energy efficiency policy defines finnair’s commitment to managing its most material environmental and energy efficiency impacts and the objective to continuously improve its operational performance in these areas. the policy is approved by the finnair executive board and owned by the ceo. the policy establishes that finnair has an environmental management system (ems) in place, which shall bring together a coordinated approach to environmental and energy efficiency management, while enabling the holistic management of significant impacts and efficiencies where possible identified material sustainability matter type description direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss adverse impacts of feedstock production for renewable fuel (saf) negative impact producing feedstock for renewable fuel has potential adverse impact on biodiversity mainly through land-use change. the potential impact occurs in finnair ́s upstream value chain in the medium- and long-term as demand and supply increase. regulation of renewable feedstock supply and transparency of saf production risk regulatory requirements can potentially lead to issues with the availability of sufficient volumes of feedstock, which may lead to shortage of saf supply on the market and thus, an increase in the price level. on the other hand, lack of transparency may create a reputational risk as finnair procures saf from the market. through a wider consideration of operational activities. the policy also states that finnair will explore the sustainable deployment of renewable fuels together with its business partners as the sustainable production of saf requires cooperation in the value chain. specific measures related to biodiversity and ecosystems are not addressed at policy-level, but rather in saf procurement guidelines and processes. the policy also establishes that finnair aims to protect biodiversity and ecosystems and minimise its impacts on these. finnair does not tolerate illegal wildlife trade (iwt) and promotes the aviation industry’s activities against it. for further information on iwt, see g1 business conduct. sbm-3 material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model ceo review report of the board of directors financial statements board of directors’ proposal on a return of capital auditor’s report finnair – financial information 2024 104 business model and operating environment financial performance in 2024 financial position and capital expenditure shareholder return policy and the board’s proposal for the distribution of profit fleet strategy implementation changes in company management shares and shareholders risk management significant risks and uncertainties seasonal variation and sensitivities in business operations outlook performance indicators classified as alternative performance measures reconciliation of performance indicators classified as alternative performance measures other performance indicators • sustainability report general information environmental information eu taxonomy e1 climate change e4 biodiversity and ecosystems e5 resource use and circular economy social information governance information report of the board of directors"
"e4-3 actions and resources related to biodiversity and ecosystems finnair’s identified material impacts and risks related to biodiversity are connected to the sourcing of biogenic saf. in its operations, finnair is committed to purchasing saf that shall meet at least the following sustainability criteria: • the purchased saf should generate at least 50% lower carbon emissions on a life cycle basis compared to the baseline of fossil fuel. the fossil baseline shall be the corsia baseline of 89 gco2e/ mj for impact measurement. this mitigates the impact of climate change on biodiversity. • the purchased saf shall be validated by an external certification body (e.g., iscc, rsb) against a recognised sustainability standards and requirements (e.g., corsia or eu red). this addresses the potential adverse impact of feedstock production on biodiversity. corsia is a global scheme designed for international flights between participating countries, whereas eu red applies to eu member states. there are certain differences between the requirements of corsia and eu red for the sustainability principles that the saf shall meet, namely in terms of biodiversity, conservation, ecosystem services, and impact on food production. continuous dialogue with finnair’s current saf providers is conducted to ensure the compatibility of the procured saf. finnair is also engaging with various stakeholders from fuel providers to regulators to ensure sustainable and scalable future production of non-biogenic saf. during 2024, finnair participated in un global compact finland’s training program focusing on science-based targets for nature (sbtn), with the aim of developing knowledge on the assessment of the nature impacts of its operations. within 2025 finnair also aims to introduce more thorough guidance on saf sustainability criteria in accordance with the latest regulatory requirements and scientific findings. during 2024, no biodiversity offsets were utilised nor was local or indigenous knowledge or nature-based solutions incorporated into decision-making. for the reporting period of 2024, finnair has not quantified the current or future operational and capital expenditures related to addressing biodiversity or ecosystem impacts. e4-4 targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems finnair has not set targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems as there is currently not a mature enough understanding of saf’s biodiversity and ecosystem impacts to put in place measurable and outcome- oriented targets. finnair’s continuous objective is to protect biodiversity and ecosystems and minimise its impacts on these. this is achieved by sustainable purchasing guidelines of saf. e4-5 impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change finnair is not following quantitative impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change as there is currently not a mature enough understanding of saf’s biodiversity and ecosystem impacts. finnair is aiming to develop understanding of its operations’ nature impacts through, for example, participation in sbtn training. the potential impacts of saf production on biodiversity and ecosystems are evaluated to materialise in the long-term so stakeholders’ understanding is likely to increase in the future along the value chain, namely among saf producers, regulators, and airlines. ceo review report of the board of directors financial statements board of directors’ proposal on a return of capital auditor’s report finnair – financial information 2024 105 business model and operating environment financial performance in 2024 financial position and capital expenditure shareholder return policy and the board’s proposal for the distribution of profit fleet strategy implementation changes in company management shares and shareholders risk management significant risks and uncertainties seasonal variation and sensitivities in business operations outlook performance indicators classified as alternative performance measures reconciliation of performance indicators classified as alternative performance measures other performance indicators • sustainability report general information environmental information eu taxonomy e1 climate change e4 biodiversity and ecosystems e5 resource use and circular economy social information governance information report of the board of directors"
"e5 resource use and circular economy finnair conducted a double materiality assessment in 2023 according to the process described under esrs 2 iro-1 description of the processes to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities. e5-1 polices related to resource use and circular economy as part of its environmental management system (ems) finnair has developed a circular economy policy that addresses the resource use and waste management aspects concerning finnair’s own operations in its helsinki-vantaa airport home hub, with specific objectives set for finnair kitchen, finnair technical operations, and finnair cargo. the policy follows the eu waste framework directive (2008/98/ ec) and its amendments to reduce material use, reuse when possible, recycle, and recover. the policy’s objective is to implement robust material management process in finnair’s own operations by the end of 2025, including the identifying of most important material and waste flows, finding opportunities to minimise those, implementing the measures, and follow-up on progress. progress is reported to the sustainability leadership team on a quarterly basis by the respective operational leadership teams that are accountable for implementing the policy. for more information on the governance of sustainability at finnair, see esrs 2 gov-1 the role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies. policy guidelines for minimising resource use emphasise continuous improvement in finnair’s own operations. aurinkomatkat operations are excluded as their resource use in own operations is minimal. identified material sustainability matter type description use of virgin resources and depletion of natural resources negative impact the extraction of virgin resources significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity loss. within finnair’s own operations, in-flight catering services cause substantial material consumption in the form of food, beverages, and packaging. proactive engagement in the adoption of reused and recycled materials within the industry presents an opportunity to ensure material availability and achieve cost-efficiency. while aircraft manufacturing predominantly involves the use of virgin raw materials, there is potential in reducing this dependency in the medium- and long-term as the cost of virgin raw materials is expected to rise. decreased need for virgin resources opportunity waste generation and non-recycling negative impact if waste is not properly handled in finnair’s own operations or its upstream value chain, there are potential negative impacts to the environment in the form of pollution and animal and plant diseases. not recycling valuable materials leads to increasing exploitation of virgin resources. environmental information ceo review report of the board of directors financial statements board of directors’ proposal on a return of capital auditor’s report finnair – financial information 2024 106 business model and operating environment financial performance in 2024 financial position and capital expenditure shareholder return policy and the board’s proposal for the distribution of profit fleet strategy implementation changes in company management shares and shareholders risk management significant risks and uncertainties seasonal variation and sensitivities in business operations outlook performance indicators classified as alternative performance measures reconciliation of performance indicators classified as alternative performance measures other performance indicators • sustainability report general information environmental information eu taxonomy e1 climate change e4 biodiversity and ecosystems e5 resource use and circular economy social information governance information report of the board of directors"
"policy guidelines include, for example, the optimisation of over-catering in finnair kitchen operations as well as reducing the use of single-use packaging in finnair cargo. in their daily operations, finnair technical operations repairs and maintains aircraft and aircraft components for re-usage, thus extending the life cycle of various aircraft parts. waste hierarchy is addressed in the policy in different stages of product and service life cycle. finnair aims to design its service elements to be light, durable, and repairable to minimise material use and to prevent waste. repairability allows for the reuse of products. finnair aims to use recyclable materials when possible. recycling objectives are set in the circular economy policy acknowledging the animal health regulation (1069/2009/ec) which prohibits recycling of international catering waste. due to the safety regulations in the aviation industry set in commission regulation (eu) no 1321/2014, usage of recycled materials in aircraft is limited, whereas within the service design for inflight catering and cargo operations the use of recycled materials is encouraged. the circular economy policy also addresses sustainable procurement practices in the upstream value chain and sets as an objective for implementing policy and working instructions for sustainable procurement for food and beverage. e5-2 actions and resources related to resource use and circular economy to achieve the objectives on material management, waste reduction, and recycling outlined in the circular economy policy, finnair has established a circular economy working group. the working group is responsible for overseeing the continuous improvement actions in the different functions, namely finnair kitchen, finnair technical operations and finnair cargo. action plans and resourcing for continuous improvement are approved and results monitored in each operational unit’s leadership team. circular economy action plan implementation does not require significant financial investments in the short-term time horizon. according to finnair’s sustainability governance model company-level performance is monitored in the sustainability leadership team. reducing the need for virgin materials finnair’s product and service design addresses circularity by following a set of principles that aim to minimise virgin material need and prevent non-recyclable waste. these principles address the weight of products, preference for recycled materials, durability and maintainability as well as recyclability by, for example, preferring monomaterials. to address virgin material use and prevent food waste finnair has established a continuous process to optimise in-flight catering. it is estimated that in 2024 this reduced the annual catering waste by 10 tonnes. finnair has also replaced individual cosmetics in business class amenity kits with on-demand cosmetics. this has reduced the amount of packaging and prevented the amenity kits from expiring. the usage of aircraft materials and material lifetime are regulated by aviation legislation. within those regulatory boundaries finnair technical operations is keeping aircraft parts in circulation for as long as possible. new repair possibilities are also constantly evaluated and implemented whenever feasible. finnair maintains and repairs various components within its own facilities. these include for example various structural items, cargo containers, brakes, wheels, batteries, and several types of cabin and galley equipment. in addition to its own maintenance and repair services, finnair participates in shared component pools with other organisations. the shared inventory and repair management activities contribute to reduced need for virgin resources and optimise finnair’s own inventory. as part of the continuous improvement agenda finnair is currently exploring the possibility of maintaining, repairing, and reusing life vests.

"annual report 2024 - cfe 46 • several new project finance arrangements in both belgium, luxembourg and poland were put in place on similar terms to those prevailing before the health crisis. as at 31 december 2024, bpi belgium and its subsidiary bpi luxembourg together had € 60 million in confirmed bilateral credit lines, of which € 3 million had been drawn down by bpi luxembourg. risks related to special-purpose vehicles to carry out some of their real estate projects, bpi belgium, bpi luxembourg and/or bpi poland belong to special purpose vehicles (“spvs”) which provide real guarantees in support of their credit facilities. the risk, in the event of the failure of this type of company and exercise of the guarantees, is that the proceeds from such exercise are not sufficient to cover some or all of the amount of shareholders’ equity or equivalent used as collateral for setting up the credit facility. the business units concerned therefore take measures and steps to mitigate risk, such as: • sharing risk with partners; • financing through non-recourse or limited-recourse debt against shareholders; • paying special attention to the preparation phase and stakeholder relations, and • monitoring marketing and sales momentum. risks related to the ability to sell projects the activity, financial position, results and prospects of business units’ operating in real estate development are almost entirely de­ pendent on the sale of its projects. investments in real estate projects for which no planning permission has been obtained yet are relatively illiquid. the business units concerned may be unable to find a suitable buyer for this type of asset if it needs cash. moreover, market conditions may force them sell their projects at lower prices than planned. the segment’s inability to generate positive cash flow from project sales can adversely affect its capacity to repay its debts. to mitigate this risk, the following measures and factors come into play: • carrying out careful market research before any investment and during development; • inserting suspensive conditions in land purchase contracts. • limiting unsecured transactions, with a minimum pre-commercialisation threshold required; • elasticity of demand in the residential market, and • adopting a conservative and prudent financing strategy, characterised by diversification of financing sources and a broad group of banking partners. risks related to portfolio concentration the vast majority of projects in this segment are residential. consequently, any slowdown or regulatory changes or any market changes affecting the residential market may have a considerable negative impact on the segment’s results and operations. in the financial year 2023, bpi luxembourg was particularly affected by a slowdown in the sector and the market has recovered only slightly in 2024. the group therefore takes the following risk management measures: • diversifying the portfolio and projects, in belgium, poland and luxembourg, and • maximising anticipation of any legislative change likely to impact projects by providing for an adjustment of the contractual provisions (price, deadline) in the event of legislative, fiscal or regulatory change. risks related to stakeholders the real estate development segment maintains contractual relations with several parties, such as partners, investors, tenants, en­ trepreneurs, financial institutions and architects. those stakeholders may experience disruptions in their operations or be confronted with financial difficulties that may cause a delay or total inability to meet their contractual obligations. the business units of the real estate development segment are therefore ensuring that the following measures are implemented: • strengthening controls for awarding and monitoring works; • including guarantees in contractual agreements, with a preference for first demand bank guarantees; • prior screening and ongoing monitoring of stakeholder creditworthiness, and • arranging appropriate insurance policies. message from the chairman and ceo our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements"
"annual report 2024 - cfe 47 risks specific to the investments & holding segment deep c holding (port concessions in vietnam) geopolitical risk the political situation in vietnam has been stable for many years. however, even if highly unlikely, political risk can never be com­ pletely ruled out. therefore, other than monitoring the evolution of the country’s political situation, no other specific measures to manage this risk are currently in place. liquidity and financing risks project development requires significant investment. deep c holding may be exposed to liquidity risk, in particular: • obligations to repay existing debt, and • general needs. deep c holding has therefore put in place corporate financing with its subsidiary infra asia investment hk, as well as local financing in vietnam to finance both fixed assets such as warehouses or leased infrastructure, and the working capital requirements of the various industrial zones etc. green offshore (minority stakes in belgian offshore wind farms, rentel and seamade) given that (i) the two wind farms are built, financed and fully operational and (ii) a minimum price for the electricity produced is guaranteed by a green certificate mechanism, the significant residual risks are: • maintenance budget overruns, and • the production of green electricity, which depends on weather conditions and the availability of wind turbines. 1.3. major events after the close of the financial year no significant change in the group’s financial and commercial situation has occurred since 31 december 2024. 1.4. research and development in 2024, the group pursued a number of innovative projects. one of these projects involves kitting, which the bpc group business unit has successfully trialled on its erasme i and tervuren sites. this intelligent logistics tool is aimed in particular at delivering goods to a consolidation centre, re-palletising ad hoc and lean-compliant phased delivery directly to the work area concerned. the group’s digital transition also accelerated in 2024 by stepping up its efforts to develop tools based on artificial intelligence. these advances are part of the group’s drive to modernise its approach to the building industry and offer its customers safer, sus­ tainable, high-performance solutions. for example, the group has been working on a project based on artificial intelligence, called “ai-generated income forecasting for construction sites”. the initial aim of this project was to use historical cash flow data from the sites of the construction & renova­ tion segment to create scripts applying polynomial regression at different degrees in order to optimise cash flow forecasts. artificial intelligence would be used to adapt these scripts dynamically, taking account of project sectors (residential, logistics, industrial, etc.), building heights and foundation methods. moreover, the teams explored potential applications in 2024, considering that future professional development could benefit from the integration of erp systems, with data being a key factor. finally, cfe poland continues to use and update its parametric design model that generates a 3d model, a carbon footprint assess­ ment and a budget estimate for logistics or industrial projects in just a few clicks. this tool helps to understand the impact of differ­ ent parameters on project budgets and carbon footprints, enabling the group to propose more optimal buildings to its customers. 1.5. financial instruments the group has defined a system of investment limits to manage the counterparty risk. this system determines maximum amounts eligible for investment by counterparty defined according to their credit rating published by standard & poor’s and moody’s. these limits are regularly monitored and updated. 1.6. outlook 2025 the medium- and long-term outlook for cfe is positive, thanks to its positioning in the growth markets of renovation and energy performance improvement of existing buildings, the development of infrastructure linked to the energy transition and sustainable mobility as well as industrial automation. message from the chairman and ceo our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements"

"annual report 2024 - cfe 97 change on the community, such as extreme weather events or rising sea levels. consequently, although these projects are essential for urban and social development, their direct contribution to climate change adaptation remains limited. as cfe does not actually hold any real estate in its portfolio, there is no real financial risk associated with climate change adaptation. the absence of these assets means that cfe is not directly exposed to the potential costs associated with upgrading or protecting infrastructure against climate impacts. esrs e1 sbm-3 19c although climate change mitigation is a material issue for cfe, involving the reduction of scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as its en­ ergy consumption, the theme of energy transition is not considered a material subject. this is because scope 3 emissions, including embodied and operational carbon, are significantly higher than direct emissions. in other words, indirect emissions linked to the materials used and building operations account for a much larger share of cfe’s total carbon footprint, so the leverage effect of this energy transition is much less relevant than managing scope 3 emissions. for this reason, cfe will not report on esrs e1-5. the assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities linked to climate change has been carried out taking into account the group’s different business lines, as each segment may present specific iros. a consolidation exercise was then carried out as described in chapter 1.5 of the dma. this analysis was carried out taking into account different time horizons (current, short-term, medium-term and long-term). on the other hand, the anticipated financial effects of iros have been omitted by applying the phase-in principle. esrs e1 sbm-3 19 a, b , esrs e1 sbm-3 ar7b although climate change is material for cfe, it does not constitute a risk requiring immediate and radical adaptation of the group’s business model. indeed, the current model is already in line with the strategy, which focuses on designing and developing sustaina­ ble buildings, intelligent industry and infrastructure for green energy and mobility. rather, it’s a transition to increased activity of this kind in the future, and both the teams and the company are ready for it. esrs e1 sbm-3 19 c, esrs e1 sbm-3 ar 8b 2.2.2. e1.iro-1: description of the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities cfe has assessed the list of esrs themes in its dma, including esrs e1 climate change, esrs e2 pollution, esrs e3 water and marine re­ sources, esrs e4 biodiversity and ecosystems, and esrs e5 resource use and circular economy. on the basis of the dma carried out, only esrs e1 climate change is identified as a risk with a high materiality of impact and financial impact. the process of identifying impacts, risks and opportunities is described in more detail in section 1.4.3 relating to dma in sustainability statements. as stipulated in the esrs, the dma exercise covers the entire value chain and is assessed over different time horizons. esrs e1.iro-1 20 a,b,c, ar 9 et ar12a the main risks, opportunities and impacts are transition risks. these are detailed in chapter 1.5.2. for climate risks, the phasing-in of provisions for the year ending 31 december 2024 have been used. cfe has developed a method­ ology for assessing climate risks and opportunities. this assessment will cover both physical and transitional risks in its own opera­ tions, as well as along the upstream and downstream value chain (including detailed scenario suggestions and time horizons to be covered in short-, medium- and long-term scenario analysis). phase in requirements for esrs ­e1.iro-1, ­ar 11 a, b, c & d, 21, ar 12 a, b, c & d, 21 et ar 15 an initial analysis indicates that no major physical risks have been identified in connection with the group’s activities. this analysis confirms the dma results. the assessment will therefore focus on transition risks. the results of this assessment could have an impact on the dma exercise carried out. 2.2.3. e1-2 climate change mitigation policies cfe has drafted a policy entitled “climate change policy”. it does not cover climate change adaptation, as this theme has not been deemed material. esrs e1-2 24, 25 this policy applies to all the group’s activities and is addressed to all group employees. it was drafted by the group’s cso and ap­ proved by the executive committee and board of directors. it is available to employees via the group intranet. with this policy, cfe undertakes not only to monitor its ghg emissions, but also to implement the actions necessary to achieve its ambitions in terms of reducing these emissions. our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"
"annual report 2024 - cfe 98 to ensure the quality and completeness of the data monitored, this policy is accompanied by a specific manual on data definition and collection methods. data is collected by the business units and consolidated by the central teams in accordance with ghg protocol methods. this policy also addresses the roles and responsibilities of the various business units in drawing up local action plans. it is also based on standards and certifications specific to the various businesses (iso, co2 performance scale, etc.). cfe revised its decarbonisation objectives in 2024 and now aims to reduce its direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 40% by 2030 com­ pared with 2020 emissions. indirect emissions (scope 3) need to be reduced by 20% by 2030, compared with the values measured in 2024. esrs e1-2 24 the path to decarbonisation is a complex one, as the construction sector has a long, fragmented and interdependent value chain. rather than setting bold ambitions without concrete actions, cfe believes in annual progress based on operational excellence, available technologies and innovation efforts. the growth in turnover and capex in line with the eu’s taxonomy is further proof of this commitment. there is clearly still a need to improve data collection, establish comparable baselines for the sector as a whole, and verify the fea­ sibility and availability of technologies that can act as levers for decarbonisation. as a result, the 2050 transition plan is still under development. this takes into account the evolution of current technological limitations, insufficient sector innovation, and the overall lack of visibility on the commitments of the rest of the sector. furthermore, scope 3 emissions were only calculated this year, and still have their limitations, as already highlighted above. on the other hand, a ghg reduction plan for 2030 has been put in place, demonstrating our decarbonisation efforts. this plan is based on the sbti framework. although not yet formally validated, cfe will adhere to the sbti framework as soon as possible. esrs e1-1 16a 2.2.4. e1-1, e1-3 et e1-4: transition plans, decarbonisation levers, targets and resources in relation to cli­ mate change policies to remain in touch with the field and market while guaranteeing a global and integrated strategic approach despite its decentral­ ised business model, cfe has put in place clear esg governance. the overall strategy, long-term vision and target setting is the responsibility of cfe’s executive committee. in particular, this means that the group’s overall ghg emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 and the related transition plans (in line with the csrd) are the responsibility of the executive committee. on the other hand, each business unit develops its own specific reduction action plans, taking into account its own business and oper­ ating model. the relevance of these plans and the possibility of carrying out collective actions are assessed at sustainability boards. as climate change and the negative impact of ghg emissions have been identified as material issues at group level, these aspects are included in the annual esg review at board level. changes in indicators and targets are also presented annually to the audit committee and the board of directors. esrs e1-1, 16 h & i in 2024, 100% of scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions are supported by a ghg reduction plan for 2030. for 2050, no commitment has been made for the reasons explained in section 2.2.3. consequently, no scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions are currently covered by a transition plan for this horizon. this plan is currently under development. 100% of scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions have reduction targets set for 2030 (short-term). these targets are aligned with sbti and therefore compatible with the paris agreements to limit global warming to 1.5°c in terms of reduction ambition, although they have not yet been formally validated by sbti. esrs e1-4, 34 e & 16 a for scope 3 ghg emissions, the most significant emission categories were mapped in 2024. emissions representing less than 1% of the total are considered non-material and will not be reported. a consultant carried out an audit to verify that no material aspect of the scope 3 emissions calculation had been overlooked, and that the calculation methodology was indeed correct. the data collected in 2024 is considered a reference value for setting the basis for reduction efforts in 2030. scope 3 emissions come mainly from the emissions category purchases of goods and services, and are based on expenditure data for the materials with the high­ est emissions for the business sector (concrete, steel, special techniques, façade elements). this calculation method will be subject to subsequent adjustments to improve accuracy. where relevant to the company, more granular data will be collected based on activity data, to refine calculations and provide better information on actions to be taken. this will be an ongoing process for years to come. our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the

"annual report 2024 - cfe 83 closely monitored. a regular review of this matrix was then carried out and systematically validated by the administrative, management and control bodies. this methodology anticipated to some extent the philosophy of a dma under the csrd. in 2024, cfe took a new dma approach using the concept of “financial materiality” (outside-in) and “impact materiality” (inside-out) based on esrs 2 and efrag ig1’s implementation guidance “materiality assessment”. the methodology for identifying potentially material themes has been presented in chapter 1.4- sbm-2 interest and view of stakeholders. the methodology used to determine the iros relating to these themes and to assess them will be presented in chapter 1.6 iro-1 and 2 double materiality assessment. cfe is convinced that the results presented give a true and fair view of its key sustainability issues, including impacts, risks and op­ portunities. the following sections provide more details on the results of the dma and the process applied. 1.5.1. results of the double materiality assessment exercise the table below summarises our assessment of the importance of sustainability issues, indicating whether they have an impact or financial materiality (or both). as far as the financial perspective is concerned, it specifies whether the importance is linked to a risk or an opportunity. only material sub-themes are represented. the analysis of the iros was carried out in detail with the various stakeholders. on the basis of the dma, three topics were selected as material: “climate change mitigation”, “safety and health of own workforce” and “safety and health of subcontractors”. cfe presents its analysis of iros in chapter 1.5.2 “impact, risks and opportunities for material themes”. the other chapters of the sus­ tainability statement detail policies, objectives, key performance indicators and progress for each material theme in accordance with the csrd format, following the sequence included in the esrs under “2. environmental information”, and “3. social information“. esrs 2 sbm-3 48 a table 8: dma results material for cfe definition corresponding esrs impact materiality financial materiality risk opportunity climate change miti­ gation the process of reduc­ ing cfe's ghg emissions (scope 1, fleet, fuel and gas;

nevertheless, the belgian judicial authorities are currently conducting an investigation into alleged criminal acts relating to the con­ struction of the grand hotel in n’djamena, chad. as a reminder, this contract, which dates back to 2011, resulted in a loss of more than eur 50 million for cfe, due to the non-payment of part of its receivables. the work was carried out by cfe tchad, a group sub­ sidiary until its sale in 2021. as part of this investigation, a search was carried out at cfe’s head office on 4 september 2024. in addition, several members of management and the board of directors, as well as former employees of the cfe group, were interviewed. however, at the date of this report, cfe has not yet had access to the investigation file and no charges have been brought against cfe or its current man­ agers and/or directors, nor, to its knowledge, against former employees of the cfe group. cfe is cooperating fully with the current investigation. in the current circumstances and in light of the above, cfe is unable to reliably estimate the financial consequences of this ongoing procedure. consequently, no provision has been recognised as at 31 december 2024, in accordance

"annual report 2024 - cfe 98 to ensure the quality and completeness of the data monitored, this policy is accompanied by a specific manual on data definition and collection methods. data is collected by the business units and consolidated by the central teams in accordance with ghg protocol methods. this policy also addresses the roles and responsibilities of the various business units in drawing up local action plans. it is also based on standards and certifications specific to the various businesses (iso, co2 performance scale, etc.). cfe revised its decarbonisation objectives in 2024 and now aims to reduce its direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 40% by 2030 com­ pared with 2020 emissions. indirect emissions (scope 3) need to be reduced by 20% by 2030, compared with the values measured in 2024. esrs e1-2 24 the path to decarbonisation is a complex one, as the construction sector has a long, fragmented and interdependent value chain. rather than setting bold ambitions without concrete actions, cfe believes in annual progress based on operational excellence, available technologies and innovation efforts. the growth in turnover and capex in line with the eu’s taxonomy is further proof of this commitment. there is clearly still a need to improve data collection, establish comparable baselines for the sector as a whole, and verify the fea­ sibility and availability of technologies that can act as levers for decarbonisation. as a result, the 2050 transition plan is still under development. this takes into account the evolution of current technological limitations, insufficient sector innovation, and the overall lack of visibility on the commitments of the rest of the sector. furthermore, scope 3 emissions were only calculated this year, and still have their limitations, as already highlighted above. on the other hand, a ghg reduction plan for 2030 has been put in place, demonstrating our decarbonisation efforts. this plan is based on the sbti framework. although not yet formally validated, cfe will adhere to the sbti framework as soon as possible. esrs e1-1 16a 2.2.4. e1-1, e1-3 et e1-4: transition plans, decarbonisation levers, targets and resources in relation to cli­ mate change policies to remain in touch with the field and market while guaranteeing a global and integrated strategic approach despite its decentral­ ised business model, cfe has put in place clear esg governance. the overall strategy, long-term vision and target setting is the responsibility of cfe’s executive committee. in particular, this means that the group’s overall ghg emission reduction targets for 2030 and 2050 and the related transition plans (in line with the csrd) are the responsibility of the executive committee. on the other hand, each business unit develops its own specific reduction action plans, taking into account its own business and oper­ ating model. the relevance of these plans and the possibility of carrying out collective actions are assessed at sustainability boards. as climate change and the negative impact of ghg emissions have been identified as material issues at group level, these aspects are included in the annual esg review at board level. changes in indicators and targets are also presented annually to the audit committee and the board of directors. esrs e1-1, 16 h & i in 2024, 100% of scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions are supported by a ghg reduction plan for 2030. for 2050, no commitment has been made for the reasons explained in section 2.2.3. consequently, no scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions are currently covered by a transition plan for this horizon. this plan is currently under development. 100% of scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions have reduction targets set for 2030 (short-term). these targets are aligned with sbti and therefore compatible with the paris agreements to limit global warming to 1.5°c in terms of reduction ambition, although they have not yet been formally validated by sbti. esrs e1-4, 34 e & 16 a for scope 3 ghg emissions, the most significant emission categories were mapped in 2024. emissions representing less than 1% of the total are considered non-material and will not be reported. a consultant carried out an audit to verify that no material aspect of the scope 3 emissions calculation had been overlooked, and that the calculation methodology was indeed correct. the data collected in 2024 is considered a reference value for setting the basis for reduction efforts in 2030. scope 3 emissions come mainly from the emissions category purchases of goods and services, and are based on expenditure data for the materials with the high­ est emissions for the business sector (concrete, steel, special techniques, façade elements). this calculation method will be subject to subsequent adjustments to improve accuracy. where relevant to the company, more granular data will be collected based on activity data, to refine calculations and provide better information on actions to be taken. this will be an ongoing process for years to come. our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the

"annual report 2024 - cfe 113 3.1.11. s1-14 health and safety metrics since safety is a major concern, cfe has developed qhse dashboards to keep close track of the trend in the figures and to take the necessary remedial action as soon as possible. the severity rate (one of the traditional security indicators) was chosen to be one of the kpi’s governing our sustainability linked loans with the banks. the dashboards, which contain the main information for each subsidiary, are updated at least once a month to keep track of the safety data. they include traditional safety information (frequency and severity rates etc.) but also indicators of proactive safety actions (toolbox meetings, management involvement, taking into account incidents and feedback, etc.). this data covers 100% of the group’s own workers. this does not include self-employed workers, temporary staff or subcontractors. the monitoring of this data follows the rules prescribed by iso 9001 and the belgian legal definitions for safety indicators: • frequency rate = number of lost-time accidents x 1 million divided by the number of working hours. • severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of working hours. • a lost-time accident is an accident in the workplace resulting in at least one day’s incapacity, not including the day of the acci­ dent. • an accident without incapacity is an accident that does not result in incapacity for work beyond the day of the accident. • a first aid accident is an accident requiring only first aid on the spot. these are not included in this report. • recordable incidents are the sum of lost-time accidents and accidents without incapacity (excluding first-aid). • the frequency rate is calculated as follows: number of lost-time accidents x 1,000,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • the severity rate is calculated as follows: severity rate = number of calendar days of absence x 1,000 divided by the number of hours worked. • the recordable incident rate is calculated as follows: number of recordable incidents x 1,000,000 divided by number of hours worked. esrs s1-14 87 table 28: data on accidents involving our own workforce 2022 2023 2024 % of workers included in the health and safety risk management 100 100 100 number of work-related fatalities (own workforce) 0 0 0 number of work-related fatalities (subcontractor or third party) 1 1 0 number of recordable accidents (excluding first aid) 145 139 115 number of lost-time accidents 93 77 64 frequency rate 21.96 18.47 15.34 severity rate 0.72 0.68 0.56 recordable accident rate nc nc 27.55 number of cases of illness directly linked to work 0 0 0 number of days lost due to an accident at work 3,050 2,847 2,321 the number of accidents reported and the number of days lost correspond to data recorded and validated by insurers for belgium and luxembourg. in poland, on the other hand, accidents and their consequences are recorded in national records. this information is therefore robust, complete and reliable. esrs s1-14 88 the safety of subcontractors is also taken into account in a specific dashboard (see chapter 3.2.7). 3.1.11.1 incidents, complaints and severe human rights impacts no offences or complaints of discrimination or failure to respect human rights were recorded in 2024. no fines have been reapplied either. esrs s1-17 3.2. esrs s2: workers in the value chain this analysis focuses specifically on subcontractors rather than the entire value chain of a construction project. the main reason is that the value chain in this sector is often very long and fragmented, involving many different players with varying roles. further­ more, there is not always direct contact with the lower links in this chain, which makes it difficult to assess all the potential risks and impacts in a comprehensive and accurate way. by focusing on subcontractors, who are key partners and directly involved in site operations, it is possible to implement more targeted and effective safety measures, ensuring better management of material risks and a significant improvement in working conditions. our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"

"annual report 2024 - cfe 102 other actions concern raising awareness or switching to alternative means of transport, which are included in the group’s mobility plan. this plan takes into account all aspects of mobility (tco, taxes, etc.) and does not involve any particular costs or investments. levers 2 and 3: energy consumption on site and in the offices to limit this, on-site consumption is monitored daily to prevent energy wastage, solar panels are being installed on the site barracks and more efficient generators are being used. there are no major costs associated with these actions, as the reduction in con­ sumption generally offsets the investment in equipment. these amounts are marginal. at the same time, a switch to green energy has already been in place since 2020. the relocation of cfe and its subsidiaries bpc, bpi, cle, vma and van laere to new buildings that consume very little energy (notably wood hub), as well as the renovation of other group headquarters, has also significantly reduced the group’s energy consumption. cfe has not identified any assets whose economic lifetime should be reduced. note on capex aligned with european taxonomy capex plays an essential role in the development of sustainable activities. these relate to equipment and machinery, cfe’s own fleet and, to a lesser extent, cfe’s offices and production sites. in 2024, a total of eur 27 million was invested in these categories, 13.97% of which was directly linked to sustainable projects, in accordance with the eu taxonomy. indirect emissions: scope 3 at this stage, it is too early to draw conclusions on the resources supporting the transition plan for scope 3 emissions. it’s a complex subject because it concerns the entire value chain. a more detailed analysis will be carried out in 2025. nevertheless, the initial trends are as follows: the cfe group’s activities will be developed to reduce costs in terms of co2 emissions, particularly in terms of the choice of materi­ als and transporting materials and waste in the construction & renovation and multitechnics segments. it is also expected that the proportion of renovation and energy-efficiency renovation work will increase as the regulatory framework evolves. the financial impact of the choice of materials or the development of new approaches to transport is estimated at the project submission stage and then incorporated into the commercial offer submitted to the customer. this study is carried out on a pro­ ject-by-project basis, so margins are re-evaluated at the start of each new order. on the other hand, a residual risk is the cost of the inefficiencies inherent in learning new production techniques or new approaches to logistics. this is because it is not always possi­ ble to anticipate (both at contractual level and when preparing for project implementation) and quantify with sufficient accuracy. the real estate business systematically includes solutions for reducing the energy consumption of buildings during the develop­ ment of new projects. in addition, renovation projects for existing buildings are becoming increasingly common. once the land has been acquired to develop a project, a feasibility study is carried out. the cost price of the project is estimated and incorporated into the commercial offer made to customers. specific framework to ensure that these actions are implemented, cfe has strengthened its management team with local sustainability officers work­ ing in the various business units, as well as a team working at the holding company to consolidate information and support local teams. the cost of this specific framework is included in “operating costs” as presented in the financial report on page 128. further details will be provided from 2025 onwards. esrs e1-3 29 ci, esrs e1-1 16c the resources linked to the transition plan will be reassessed in greater detail in 2025 to analyse the costs linked to the scope 3 re­ duction plan, once this has been finalised. similarly, an analysis will be made to take account of the 2050 targets and the corresponding reduction plan once it has been final­ ised. no significant capital investment is planned for economic activities related to thermal coal, nuclear power or fossil fuel. esrs e1-1 16 f; esrs e1-3 29 c ii,16 c & c iii,16 c 2.2.4.3 risks of blocking ghg emissions capital expenditure (capex) has been assessed and the blocking risk has not been considered significant. esrs e1-1 16 d 2.2.4.4 eu benchmarks aligned with paris agreements neither cfe nor any of its subsidiaries are excluded from the eu benchmarks aligned with the paris agreements. esrs e1-1 16 g our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"

"annual report 2024 - cfe 115 3.2.5. s2-3 processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise concerns to remedy negative impacts on sites, it is essential to put in place a structured process and effective communication channels. this process begins with the identification and assessment of potential impacts. this includes carrying out risk analyses to identify potential hazards and assess their severity and probability. at the start of site activities, each subcontractor is required to share this specific risk analysis with the site management team, in order to analyse the resources to be implemented and responsibilities to­ gether. once the impacts have been identified, preventive and/or corrective measures must be implemented. this can include modifying work procedures, improving safety equipment, or training workers to better manage identified risks. it is crucial to document these measures and ensure that they are clearly communicated to all team members. to enable workers in the value chain to voice their concerns, several communication channels need to be established: onboarding new workers: this onboarding provides information and training for new workers on a project. in particular, the organi­ sational chart of site management and their contact details are provided to facilitate future exchanges. regular meetings: weekly safety meetings are organised on projects where workers can discuss safety issues and propose solu­ tions. direct communication lines: subcontractors are encouraged to communicate any concerns or comments directly with site teams as a matter of priority. mobile applications: on most worksites, a mobile app enables workers to report incidents or concerns quickly and easily. security representatives: the site’s qhse manager, along with the entire site management team, makes regular visits to the site, enabling direct interaction with all those involved. it’s also important to create a safety culture where workers feel comfortable reporting problems without fear of reprisal. this is en­ couraged by visible, committed leadership that values and respects workers’ contributions to safety. finally, it is essential to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place, by tracking safety indicators. esrs s2-3 27, 28 3.2.6. s2-4 taking action on material impacts on value chain workers, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to value chain workers, and effectiveness of those actions each project is unique and requires a specific risk analysis. this exercise must be carried out both by the project management team and by subcontractors. this analysis must be carried out before work begins, to enable a dialogue with the project’s management teams and to validate the most suitable working methods for limiting risks together. scheduling will also be defined in such a way as to keep co-activities between workers to a minimum. weekly site meetings allow us to see whether or not we need to adapt or correct the chosen work methods. everyone involved in a project is jointly responsible for their own safety and that of others. on the other hand, subcontracting agree­ ments specify in detail the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. among other things, it defines who is responsible for the breakdown and maintenance of collective protection equipment. each subcontractor is responsible for his or her own personal protective equipment. on the other hand, the site management team will ensure that each employee uses the equipment correctly. the site management team will ensure that a responsible, collaborative and respectful site culture is in place. this working atmos­ phere facilitates communication and a genuine safety culture. regular checks are carried out on site by the bu’s qhse manager and by management teams. these visits enable us to identify safety shortcomings and correct them as quickly as possible. these visits are always accompanied by a visit report to ensure that every remark has been addressed. control also involves regular monitoring and communication of safety indicators. a specific monthly dashboard also includes the number of incidents and accidents involving subcontractors. the management team will also ensure that subcontracting teams receive the necessary training. in the event of failure to comply with the established rules, penalties are applied. in the event of serious misconduct, the person responsible will be asked to leave the site with immediate effect and will not be allowed to return. cfe also monitors the company’s track record in terms of safety compliance and safety culture, and

"annual report 2024 - cfe 40 pollution, particularly from the use of construction materials and site activities, has an impact on air and soil quality. there is a risk of potential contamination of natural environments, as well as a more general risk of impact on biodiversity. the increasing scarcity of materials, aggravated by growing demand and disruptions to supply chains, poses challenges for the sustainability of resources. waste management is therefore crucial, as construction sites generate large quantities of waste that must be sorted and recycled to minimise their impact on the environment. finally, water usage is also an important issue, as construction activities consume large quantities of water, and wastewater discharges can pollute water resources. in this regard, the group is committed to reducing pollution and environmental waste by aiming for “zero environmental incidents”. to this end, all group teams are committed to exemplary behaviour and to rigorously following quality, health, safety and environ­ ment policies (“qhse”), which are based on the requirements detailed in iso 9001, iso 45001 and iso 14001 , as well as vca certifica­ tion. in particular, the group’s business units may be subject to various risks linked to the environmental conditions of the projects in which they are involved. in addition to the economic aspects, environmental risks can also be assessed in terms of image and reputation, as the operation may be affected over the long term by their consequences. from a longer term perspective, changes in regulations related to the ecological transition may also constitute a risk factor. all these risks can therefore generate human, technical, financial and legal issues. the measures for managing the risks are: • analysing these risks as early as the tender phase and developing solutions with the development teams, taking into account these issues as far upstream as possible; • implementing appropriate technical and organisational solutions to reduce risks – bearing in mind that these risks evolve throughout the life of the projects; • restoration costs related to major climatic events may be partially covered by insurance companies. the environmental issues relating to the group’s activities and their potential impact on the environment are detailed more specifi­ cally in section 2 of the sustainability statement. 1.2.3. operational risks at group level a distinction should be made between the risks common to the four divisions and those specific to each segment. risks common to all four segments risks associated with project execution the main characteristic of the group’s main activities is the commitment made when submitting a proposal to perform a task that is by its nature unique, for a price with predetermined terms and within an agreed time schedule. the risks are mainly related to: • “upstream phase”, i.e. before the contract is signed: • poor assessment of the project or client; • design and costing errors; • errors in assessing the terms of the contract; • overestimation of available internal resources, and • poor evaluation of subcontracting. • “downstream phase”, i.e. after the contract is signed: • insufficient or inadequate staff and supplies; • difficult customer relations; • encountering the unexpected; • pollution or environmental accidents; • changes imposed by the client during the work; • poor contract management; • changes in the cost of materials and supplies; • supply chain disruption and shortages of raw materials and labour; message from the chairman and ceo our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements"

"annual report 2024 - cfe 100 age of 180 kwh/m2/year for office buildings, wood hub stands out as an exceptional nzeb (nearly zero energy building), designed for the future. the reduction potential of these actions is fairly limited (less than 1%), as total energy consumption in offices is very low compared with construction sites. nevertheless, these actions are necessary to be consistent with other actions and to establish a real corporate culture around the challenges of climate change. although we have taken advantage of most of the levers for reducing ghg emissions from scopes 1 and 2, cfe continues to seek further optimisation of its energy consumption. the company regularly tests new pilot projects on its worksites, and closely monitors technological advances and innovations in this field. particular attention is paid to construction site generators, for which current technology unfortunately does not yet meet market expectations. esrs e1-3 29a, esrs e1-3 ar21, esrs e1-1 14, 16b,j, esrs e1-4 34f, 16b to ensure that these various measures are followed up, and that worksites choose the solutions best suited to their situation, cfe has compiled all solutions that bring good results in a handbook called the ‘greenbook’. by 2024, cfe has already achieved an absolute reduction of 25% in total scope 1 and 2 compared with the 2020 reference values. the expected results for 2024 were to achieve a 16% reduction on 2020 values. these excellent results are due in particular to the rapid adoption of on-site energy optimisation methods and an effective fleet greening policy. esrs e1-3 29 b table 19 : scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions by source scope 1 and 2 results of actions taken unit 2020 reference 2023 n-1 2024 n improvement on n-1 improvement on reference year scope 1 tco2eq 15,812.17 13,974.47 11,235.58 -20% -29% fleet tco2eq 11,713.19 9,821.61 8,329.56 -15% -29% fuel tco2eq 3,319.34 3,078.64 1,966.17 -36% -41% gas tco2eq 779.64 992.62 899.72 -9% 15% refrigerants tco2eq 0.00 81.60 40.13 -51% scope 2 tco2eq 1,872.00 1,412.11 1,954.99 38% 4% electricity tco2eq 1,872.00 1,342.15 1,742.15 30% -7% electricity for the fleet tco2eq 0.00 69,96* 212.84 204% total scope 1 and 2 tco2eq 17,684.17 15,386.58 13,190.57 -14% -25% *in the previous year’s report (2023), ghg emissions linked to electric vehicle charging were erroneously calculated in scope 1 instead of scope 2, which explains the minimal deviation in scope 1 and 2 values for 2023 (67.69 tco2eq). however, total scope 1 and 2 emissions for 2023 remain unchanged esrs e1-3 29 b, esrs e1-4 34 a,b indirect emissions: scope 3 in 2024, cfe carried out a complete analysis of its indirect emissions according to the ghg protocol. this analysis highlighted the material categories of scope 3 ghg emissions, which are “purchases of goods and services”, which accounts for 92% of emissions, “use of products sold”, which accounts for 7% of emissions, and to a lesser extent “goods and equipment”, which accounts for 1% of emissions. in the “purchases of goods and services” category, this analysis shows that a small category of materials is responsible for the majority of these emissions. these include concrete, steel, façade elements and, to a lesser extent, technical building instal­ lations such as hvac, piping, cabling, etc. taking into account this analysis, as well as current technologies, information and con­ struction methods, cfe has defined its objectives for 2030. cfe has carried out an in-depth study of the stated objectives of its value chain, in particular those of suppliers of materials with a high impact on ghg emissions. based on this information, cfe has set itself the target of reducing its scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2030, based on 2024 values. a detailed reduction plan has yet to be drawn up, requiring a more granular analysis of the data. specific targets for the “use of products sold” category will also be defined from 2025. the 20% reduction target applies to the entire cfe group. esrs e1-3 ar21, esrs e1-4 33, esrs e1-4 34b as 2024 is the reference year, so far there are no measurable results from the actions undertaken. esrs e1-3 29 b lever 1 - sustainable suppliers and materials the main lever for reducing scope 3 ghgs is therefore the commitment of suppliers who themselves have targets and reduction plans in line with the paris agreements. alongside this lever, cfe also wants to take a pro-active approach. as a developer, bpi real estate is committed to developing sustainable projects and limiting both the level of embodied carbon and our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"
"annual report 2024 - cfe 102 other actions concern raising awareness or switching to alternative means of transport, which are included in the group’s mobility plan. this plan takes into account all aspects of mobility (tco, taxes, etc.) and does not involve any particular costs or investments. levers 2 and 3: energy consumption on site and in the offices to limit this, on-site consumption is monitored daily to prevent energy wastage, solar panels are being installed on the site barracks and more efficient generators are being used. there are no major costs associated with these actions, as the reduction in con­ sumption generally offsets the investment in equipment. these amounts are marginal. at the same time, a switch to green energy has already been in place since 2020. the relocation of cfe and its subsidiaries bpc, bpi, cle, vma and van laere to new buildings that consume very little energy (notably wood hub), as well as the renovation of other group headquarters, has also significantly reduced the group’s energy consumption. cfe has not identified any assets whose economic lifetime should be reduced. note on capex aligned with european taxonomy capex plays an essential role in the development of sustainable activities. these relate to equipment and machinery, cfe’s own fleet and, to a lesser extent, cfe’s offices and production sites. in 2024, a total of eur 27 million was invested in these categories, 13.97% of which was directly linked to sustainable projects, in accordance with the eu taxonomy. indirect emissions: scope 3 at this stage, it is too early to draw conclusions on the resources supporting the transition plan for scope 3 emissions. it’s a complex subject because it concerns the entire value chain. a more detailed analysis will be carried out in 2025. nevertheless, the initial trends are as follows: the cfe group’s activities will be developed to reduce costs in terms of co2 emissions, particularly in terms of the choice of materi­ als and transporting materials and waste in the construction & renovation and multitechnics segments. it is also expected that the proportion of renovation and energy-efficiency renovation work will increase as the regulatory framework evolves. the financial impact of the choice of materials or the development of new approaches to transport is estimated at the project submission stage and then incorporated into the commercial offer submitted to the customer. this study is carried out on a pro­ ject-by-project basis, so margins are re-evaluated at the start of each new order. on the other hand, a residual risk is the cost of the inefficiencies inherent in learning new production techniques or new approaches to logistics. this is because it is not always possi­ ble to anticipate (both at contractual level and when preparing for project implementation) and quantify with sufficient accuracy. the real estate business systematically includes solutions for reducing the energy consumption of buildings during the develop­ ment of new projects. in addition, renovation projects for existing buildings are becoming increasingly common. once the land has been acquired to develop a project, a feasibility study is carried out. the cost price of the project is estimated and incorporated into the commercial offer made to customers. specific framework to ensure that these actions are implemented, cfe has strengthened its management team with local sustainability officers work­ ing in the various business units, as well as a team working at the holding company to consolidate information and support local teams. the cost of this specific framework is included in “operating costs” as presented in the financial report on page 128. further details will be provided from 2025 onwards. esrs e1-3 29 ci, esrs e1-1 16c the resources linked to the transition plan will be reassessed in greater detail in 2025 to analyse the costs linked to the scope 3 re­ duction plan, once this has been finalised. similarly, an analysis will be made to take account of the 2050 targets and the corresponding reduction plan once it has been final­ ised. no significant capital investment is planned for economic activities related to thermal coal, nuclear power or fossil fuel. esrs e1-1 16 f; esrs e1-3 29 c ii,16 c & c iii,16 c 2.2.4.3 risks of blocking ghg emissions capital expenditure (capex) has been assessed and the blocking risk has not been considered significant. esrs e1-1 16 d 2.2.4.4 eu benchmarks aligned with paris agreements neither cfe nor any of its subsidiaries are excluded from the eu benchmarks aligned with the paris agreements. esrs e1-1 16 g our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"
"annual report 2024 - cfe 114 3.2.1. sbm2 interests and views of stakeholders collaboration and dialogue with subcontractors are essential elements of cfe’s group strategy. we consider them as important as our own workforce. by fostering open, ongoing communication, we ensure that subcontractors are fully integrated into our process­ es and share our safety and quality objectives. this collaborative approach strengthens relationships based on trust, improves co­ ordination on construction sites and ensures that everyone works together harmoniously and efficiently. by valuing the contributions of subcontractors and treating them as key partners, we create a safer, more productive working environment for all. esrs 2 sbm-2 3.2.2. sbm3 material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business model the dma exercise (chap 1.5.1) has demonstrated that health and safety are material sub-themes for cfe and its subcontractors. in particular, there is a significant risk of negative impact, as accidents can occur on site, leading to serious incapacity, permanent after-effects and even death. the heart of cfe’s business happens on the construction sites. the work is carried out by cfe’s own workers or by subcontractors. at present, there’s no way of carrying out these projects without manpower. every effort must therefore be made to limit these risks. cfe considers that it is just as important to fight to limit safety risks on site for its own workforce as for subcontractors, since every human being deserves to be treated equally in the face of danger. the analysis carried out in chapter 3.1.2 therefore also covers the entire value chain. esrs s2-sbm-3 11 a,c 3.2.3. s2-1 policies related to value chain workers cfe has adopted a series of policies that apply both to its own workforce and to the various parties involved on site. these include the human rights policy and the qhse policy. these documents are described in detail in chapter 3.1.3. a code of conduct for commercial partners has also been drawn up. it includes an obligation to comply with the internal code of conduct, and in particular to respect the safety rules set out in the qhse policy. the obligation to comply with local and european laws and regulations, as well as with the aforementioned policies, are an integral part of the contractual clauses for sub-contractors. esrs s2-16, 17, 18, 19 3.2.4. s2-2 processes for engaging with value chain workers about impacts ongoing dialogue with the various parties involved on our worksites is a priority, and this primarily concerns safety. the onboarding of all subcontractors is formalised by means of a short training session introducing the site, the contact persons and the specific rules relating to the project. it is vital to ensure that everyone can identify the various stakeholders involved, and knows who to contact in the event of any problems. the site manager will ensure that all this information is understood by providing training in a language that the workers understand. each team should have a manager who speaks one of the project’s national languages, to ensure that he or she can communicate with the site management teams at all times. formal meetings are held at least once a week with subcontractors working on the site. to ensure that these meetings run smoothly, team leaders from the various subcontractors represent their companies. these meetings are followed by a clear report setting out the actions to be taken by the various parties involved, an update on the schedule and an overview of the phases to come. a lean and collaborative approach is adopted on all projects. engagement with the value chain on worksites on safety issues, using a lean approach, is essential to ensure a safe and efficient working environment. secondly, value chain mapping enables us to analyse each stage of the construction process, from design to delivery, and detect critical points where safety incidents may occur. a culture of safety must be established, with visible leadership where managers set the example by respecting and valuing safety practices and open communication. finally, the monitoring and evaluation of safety performance, through key indicators and regular site visits, ensures compliance with standards and identifies areas for improvement. by integrating these lean principles into worksite safety management, it is possible to create a safer, more efficient and more col­ laborative working environment. the key lies in the commitment of all players in the value chain and in a culture of continuous im­ provement. penalties are foreseen and communicated for any worker who does not respect the safety rules in force on projects. esrs s2-2 our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"
"annual report 2024 - cfe 115 3.2.5. s2-3 processes to remediate negative impacts and channels for value chain workers to raise concerns to remedy negative impacts on sites, it is essential to put in place a structured process and effective communication channels. this process begins with the identification and assessment of potential impacts. this includes carrying out risk analyses to identify potential hazards and assess their severity and probability. at the start of site activities, each subcontractor is required to share this specific risk analysis with the site management team, in order to analyse the resources to be implemented and responsibilities to­ gether. once the impacts have been identified, preventive and/or corrective measures must be implemented. this can include modifying work procedures, improving safety equipment, or training workers to better manage identified risks. it is crucial to document these measures and ensure that they are clearly communicated to all team members. to enable workers in the value chain to voice their concerns, several communication channels need to be established: onboarding new workers: this onboarding provides information and training for new workers on a project. in particular, the organi­ sational chart of site management and their contact details are provided to facilitate future exchanges. regular meetings: weekly safety meetings are organised on projects where workers can discuss safety issues and propose solu­ tions. direct communication lines: subcontractors are encouraged to communicate any concerns or comments directly with site teams as a matter of priority. mobile applications: on most worksites, a mobile app enables workers to report incidents or concerns quickly and easily. security representatives: the site’s qhse manager, along with the entire site management team, makes regular visits to the site, enabling direct interaction with all those involved. it’s also important to create a safety culture where workers feel comfortable reporting problems without fear of reprisal. this is en­ couraged by visible, committed leadership that values and respects workers’ contributions to safety. finally, it is essential to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the measures put in place, by tracking safety indicators. esrs s2-3 27, 28 3.2.6. s2-4 taking action on material impacts on value chain workers, and approaches to managing material risks and pursuing material opportunities related to value chain workers, and effectiveness of those actions each project is unique and requires a specific risk analysis. this exercise must be carried out both by the project management team and by subcontractors. this analysis must be carried out before work begins, to enable a dialogue with the project’s management teams and to validate the most suitable working methods for limiting risks together. scheduling will also be defined in such a way as to keep co-activities between workers to a minimum. weekly site meetings allow us to see whether or not we need to adapt or correct the chosen work methods. everyone involved in a project is jointly responsible for their own safety and that of others. on the other hand, subcontracting agree­ ments specify in detail the roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. among other things, it defines who is responsible for the breakdown and maintenance of collective protection equipment. each subcontractor is responsible for his or her own personal protective equipment. on the other hand, the site management team will ensure that each employee uses the equipment correctly. the site management team will ensure that a responsible, collaborative and respectful site culture is in place. this working atmos­ phere facilitates communication and a genuine safety culture. regular checks are carried out on site by the bu’s qhse manager and by management teams. these visits enable us to identify safety shortcomings and correct them as quickly as possible. these visits are always accompanied by a visit report to ensure that every remark has been addressed. control also involves regular monitoring and communication of safety indicators. a specific monthly dashboard also includes the number of incidents and accidents involving subcontractors. the management team will also ensure that subcontracting teams receive the necessary training. in the event of failure to comply with the established rules, penalties are applied. in the event of serious misconduct, the person responsible will be asked to leave the site with immediate effect and will not be allowed to return. cfe also monitors the company’s track record in terms of safety compliance and safety culture, and takes this into account when selecting subcontractors. cfe is not aware of any serious human rights problems or incidents linked to the upstream or downstream value chain (other than the site accidents listed in the following chapter). our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"

scope 1: all direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company (e.g. fleet, fuel and natural gas combus­ tion). • ghg - scope 2: all indirect emissions from the production of electricity purchased by the company. scope 2 emissions occur physically at the facility where the electricity is generated. • ghg - scope 2 location based: this method calculates emissions using the average emission factor of the electricity network where the energy is consumed. it reflects the average emissions intensity of local electricity networks • ghg- scope 2 market based: this method calculates emissions based on the electricity that organisations have chosen to purchase, often specified in contracts or instruments such as renewable energy certificates (recs). it takes into account the company’s specific energy supply choices. • ghg – scope 3: indirect emissions from a company’s activities, such as emissions from the production of sourced products (upstream) or from products, services or projects sold by the company (downstream). • ghg protocol (greenhouse gas protocol): a standardised global framework for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from private and public sector operations, value chains and mitigation actions. it provides the most widely used standards for ghg emissions accounting, helping companies, countries and cities to track their progress towards climate goals. • human rights: rights as defined in the universal declaration of human rights. • ilo (international labour organization) : this is a specialised agency of the united nations. its mandate is to promote social and economic justice by establishing international labour standards • iro (impact, risks and opportunities); • impacts: the effects that the company’s activities have on the environment and society. • risks: the potential threats facing the company, such as climate or financial risks. • opportunities: potential opportunities for development and innovation • jv (joint venture): this is a commercial partnership in which two or more companies join forces to carry out a joint project. our ambitions and achievements management report sustainability statements financial statements message from the chairman and ceo"

"high-performing, diverse teams our ambition is to offer equal opportunities to all our colleagues, no matter who they are or where they work. we expect our leaders to embrace their role as inclusive leaders and ensure everyone feels valued, respected, and safe to contribute their best. in 2024, danfoss' employees represented 131 nationalities. 30% of our colleagues and 24% of our leaders are women. we have set targets for a more diverse leadership: 30% women in leadership positions by 2025 and 80% management team diversity by 2030. this means, a minimum of two nationalities and genders in all danfoss leadership teams at management levels 1-4. responsibility for our people strategy lies with our executive vice president, group human resources. we know that to meet our diversity targets, we must build our leadership pipeline through succession planning and talent development. we have seen steady progress every year but also realize that it will take more time to reach our stretched 30% target of women in leadership positions. focus areas in 2024 we continued to strengthen our attraction and recruitment practices, such as inclusive language in job ads, unconscious bias training for hiring managers and recruiters, and exit surveys. a key focus has been on improving the onboarding of new colleagues joining danfoss to quickly strengthen their sense of belonging by providing the best possible start in their new team and role. our employee resource groups (ergs) have continued to help us identify and address existing barriers to inclusion, and provide access to community building, personal and professional growth, mentoring, and networking for many danfoss colleagues. our five global erg themes cover abilities — gender, generations, multicultural and nations, and pride — which are currently driven by 46 local employee-led groups. activities include seminars and events on unconscious bias, women in stem, neurodiversity, work environment for seniors and millennials, mental health, and well-being. danfoss leaders serve as executive sponsors and encourage broad involvement. we have also continued mentoring programs for women, with one led by our president & ceo. the programs offer women in senior leadership positions the opportunity to grow through coaching from top leadership and building a strong network. talent development developing our people is key to continuing the transformation of danfoss. by providing in-house and external training, mentoring, and coaching programs, as well as talent rotation possibilities, we aim to foster a culture of continuous learning and knowledge- sharing. along with people and performance reviews, people development and succession planning are ongoing priorities for our leaders. focus areas in 2024 people development is key for both engagement and retention of our people. we apply the 70:20:10 learning model where 70% of learning and development comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from working together and learning from each other, and 10% from formal training. we have invested in e-learning opportunities that enable employees to learn at their own pace. additionally, we have we firmly believe that diverse teams are more innovative and deliver better results. we strive to create and cultivate an inclusive growth-oriented culture that empowers our team members to be themselves and boldly share opinions. functional training in areas like finance, operations, safety, quality, and sustainability. we have succession plans in place for all critical roles at danfoss, with 25% of successors and 30% of the total talent pipeline being women candidates. to support our succession pipeline, we partner with international business schools like insead. to support our target of 30% women in leadership positions, we always consider gender balance in leadership programs. in 2024, women represented 32% of the participants in our insead program. the executive transitions program supports a smooth transition to executive roles. members of the group execu- tive team welcome and onboard the past year’s new sen- ior leaders. in 2024, we had over 60 program participants with an average age of 45, of which 37% were women. our global mentoring program has supported the development of 280 people since 2019. in 2024, we finished the 5th cohort with an overall satisfaction score of 8.7 out of 10. we also started the 6th cohort with 49 new mentees, representing 15 nationalities and a share of 45% women. 83 / 185 danfoss annual report 2024 > sustainability statement > social"
"the danfoss postgraduate program remains a key talent pipeline for early career development. in 2024, we celebrated the 50-year anniversary of the program. striving for gender and nationality balance remains a priority, and in 2024, the share of women was 48%, while 13 nationalities were represented. equal pay for work of equal value equal pay for work of equal value, regardless of gender, is a key element of equity and equality, and fundamental for our ability to attract, motivate, and retain colleagues. the basic principles of fairness, equity, and transparency are embedded in our company values and behaviors and as such danfoss is committed to competitive and fair compensation and benefits. our ambition is to maintain the total gender pay gap below 5% globally. to prevent pay gaps, we monitor the developments by comparing salary levels between men and women within defined, comparable job bands and when needed targeted mitigation actions to increase relevant salaries are implemented. this is governed by our total rewards policies and processes, which are reviewed annually. the total net gender pay gap globally in 2024 reached 6.3%. during the year, we have adjusted our calculation methods to better reflect the direction from the eu pay transparency directive. consequently, we have recalculated our 2023 gender pay gap to 6.9%. during the year we have seen an improvement, and we remain committed to lower the gap to below 5%. the gross gap in pay between genders was 22.5% (2023: 22.4%). our calculation is based on data for salaried employees. to prepare for the eu pay transparency directive taking effect in 2026, we focused in 2024 on eu countries as a starting point. following targeted actions, the net gender pay gap per job category in the eu countries was lowered from 5.9% to 4.6%. in 2025, we will start incorporating the analysis of hourly employees, adding variable pay elements, and quantifiable benefits. to ensure mindful and bias-free pay decisions, we will additionally focus on upskilling our leaders and hr professionals who execute pay decisions together. living wage at danfoss, we believe that providing a decent total compensation through a living wage is an important aspect of respecting human rights. we are therefore committed to paying our employees a living wage. this means providing compensation that covers basic needs such as costs of housing, food, transportation, telecommunication, childcare, clothing, personal care, furnishing, and medical care, as well as allowing for savings. in 2024, we started to assess our compensation and payment practices across all our own operations to ensure that all danfoss employees receive a living wage. to date, our assessment has covered more than 60% of our workforce. in 2025, we will finalize our assessment and moving forward, we will also continue establishing processes to ensure that we meet our commitment. 84 / 185 danfoss annual report 2024 > sustainability statement > social"
"case story to enhance workplace well-being and productivity, we want danfoss to be a safe space to speak up, where our high-performing, diverse teams feel valued and empowered to contribute their best. in 2024, we launched virtual conversations with top leaders about psychological safety and team impact. psychological safety means that colleagues feel included and safe to learn, contribute, and challenge status quo. it creates a safe work environment where team members can take risks, make mistakes, ask questions, and offer new ideas without fear of embarrassment or humiliation. in conclusion, a safe environment forms the foundation for addressing biases and fostering a growth mindset, thus leading to better performance. engaging with our people to ensure our colleagues feel safe to raise work- related concerns, we engage with our colleagues in many ways and provide several channels for raising questions or concerns, including hr- and it-related inquiries through our service hub platform; the danfoss ethics hotline, which serves as a whistleblower function; and our global network of ergs. focus areas in 2024 our four danfoss askhr hubs provide professional employee services on people inquiries — including wages, benefits, holidays, policies, or specific concerns that might require personnel intervention. we encourage our managers to give instant and constructive feedback. regular manager-employee conversations enable our people to grow and perform. to promote an open feedback culture, every employee is offered individual performance dialogues with their immediate manager that focus on performance, new goals, and development plans for upcoming years. our global engagement survey, the voice, takes account of our people’s satisfaction, engagement, and inclusion and identifies areas for improvement. it is conducted every second year and most recently in 2023, with a 92% participation rate and an engagement score of 79, placing us in the top quartile of our benchmark peer group, which is our ambition. the survey showed, among other things, that psychological safety was a key driver of inclusion at danfoss, an insight we brought into our work in 2024. all teams discuss their own survey reports for additional insights to create action plans. our leaders are responsible for follow-up and can conduct local pulse surveys, enabling prompt action. additionally, we continued our engagement with work councils, which enables a social dialogue with employee representatives is important for building trust and integrity. our work councils are organized at the local, national, and european level. the danfoss european works council (dewc) is the highest forum for collaboration between employees and management. the dewc consists of 34 representatives from 28 countries, representing 19,742 or 50% of our employees. meeting minutes are published on our intranet. in 2024, we also held meetings with employee representatives and unions in non-eu countries, ensuring effective execution of the collective bargaining agreements within day-to-day operations. a few examples come from the us, where danfoss meets with two collective bargaining units on a regular basis, and latin america and china, where danfoss has continuous social dialogues with local unions at most locations, e.g., related to reorganization, safety, and other labor union activities. being safe 85 / 185 danfoss annual report 2024 > sustainability statement > social"

"the whistleblower function — including the danfoss ethics hotline, which is publicly available — plays an important role in helping us identify and understand where and how human rights impacts may be taking place in our value chain. if we find that danfoss has caused or contributed to actual negative impacts on human rights, we will ensure that we meet our responsibilities according to the ungps. this means that we will ensure that remediation actions are taken and remedy is provided for impacted people. the actions we take are determined on a case-by-case basis and depend on whether our role as a business is directly linked or contributed to the negative impact. through our human rights due diligence process, we have identified salient human rights issues. these are human rights that are at the greatest risk of severe negative impact. to address these risks and potential adverse impacts, we work proactively to mitigate and prevent human rights-related risks in our value chain. as part of our due diligence process, we monitor our activities to ensure progress in our risk prevention and risk mitigation. regular follow-up ensures that progress is monitored and countries with the highest risk of negative impacts are prioritized. for example, to ensure the health and safety of our employees, all our factories are covered by our 'safety first' program and have actions in place to prevent excessive working hours during peak seasons. we actively work to raise awareness on topics such as discrimination and have processes established to prevent discrimination in the workplace. our responsibility to respect human rights extends across our value chain as defined by the un guiding principles. in previous years, we conducted an assessment to identify our salient human rights issues. one of the key issues identified relates to modern slavery, including forced labor, child labor, prison labor, and human trafficking. our requirements for our employees and suppliers are clearly defined in our danfoss ethics handbook and our danfoss supplier code of conduct, and they are integrated into our supplier onboarding and monitoring mechanisms. additional information on how we work to address and mitigate modern slavery risks is found in the danfoss modern slavery act statement which is available here key actions in 2024 in 2024, we continued to assess and strengthen our due diligence processes in pursuance of existing and incoming regulation on sustainability due diligence. we also conducted an internal mapping against the eu corporate sustainability due diligence directive (csddd) to gain a better understanding of potential areas for improvement. furthermore, we strengthened our due diligence regarding potential military end-use of our products. during the year, we also updated our human rights policy to reflect our commitment on human rights due diligence. going forward, in 2025 we will focus on actions that aim to increase transparency of our value chain and strengthen our risk assessment and due diligence processes. responsible mineral sourcing and conflict minerals minerals such as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold that originate from conflicted or high-risk areas are known as conflict minerals as these are used to finance armed conflicts and human rights abuses. danfoss supports the efforts of governments and organizations to end human rights abuses and violations in conflict areas. danfoss is therefore committed to sourcing materials and components from companies that also share our values regarding human rights, ethics, and environmental responsibility. to support the responsible minerals initiative and to enable responsible sourcing decision-making, we review whether the tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold in our products originate from conflict-affected or high-risk regions. as part of this work, we engage with our suppliers on an ongoing basis through, for example, our recurring campaigns to acquire supplier information on conflict minerals, including smelter/ refiner identification and country of origin. through our supplier engagement approach, we are able to reach 1,500 tier one suppliers on an annual basis to address this topic. this has enabled us to provide conflict minerals reporting templates (cmrt) to our customers and initiate relevant due diligence activities to mitigate high risk smelters in our supply chain. read more about policies on danfoss business conduct danfoss ethics handbook ethics and human rights danfoss human rights reporting danfoss supplier code of conduct danfoss position on responsible mineral sourcing 88 / 185 danfoss annual report 2024 > sustainability statement > social"

"material iro description how do we manage the iro? climate-related physical risks (chronic and acute) risk (own operations) the chronic physical risks relate to the dependency of renewable energy generation on natural resources, such as wind patterns, and the acute physical risks relate to a potential increase in the severity and frequency of extreme weather events. we assess the resilience of all new assets towards the occurrence of climate-related hazards. energy consumption, mainly at our chp plants negative impact (own operations) we have identified a negative impact associated with energy consumption at our combined heat and power (chp) plants, which includes the use of fossil-based fuels. the use of fossil-based fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which negatively affect the environment by contributing to global warming. we target reductions in our scope 1 and 2 ghg emissions. in 2024, we closed esbjerg power station, our last coal-fired chp plant, advancing our decarbonisation efforts. climate change adaption energy this section outlines our approach to managing climate-­ related impacts, risks, and opportunities, ensuring ­resilience and alignment with global ­sustainability goals. while the transition to a green economy offers significant growth opportunities, it also presents ­challenges, particularly in decarbonising supply chains. we have already made substantial progress, transitioning from a fossil fuel-based utility to a global leader in renewable energy. our policies, strategic actions, and other initiatives highlight our continued efforts towards a low-carbon economy. for an overview of how we have structured this ­chapter, please see page 61. our iros are highlighted in italics. // e1-1 transition plan ørsted’s transition plan outlines the company’s overall pathway to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040, aligned with the 1.5 °c goal of the paris agreement. the plan is substantiated by science-based targets, includes key decarbonisation levers, and identifies strategic actions that have driven the transformation of our business model towards renewable energy and will continue to shape our ongoing transition. the plan supports broader policy priorities, including the european union’s 2050 climate neutrality goals formalised in the european green deal and associated regulations (e.g. the eu taxonomy and the eu green bonds standard). these goals represent both an opportunity and a responsibility to align our business strategy with global decarbonisation efforts, contributing to the renewable energy transition and broader sustainability objectives. first transition wave: shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy over the past 15 years, we have undergone a significant transformation, evolving from a fossil fuel-based utility to a global leader in renewable energy deployment. this transformation has been driven by substantial investments in offshore wind, onshore wind, solar pv, and storage assets, achieving material progress in decarbonising energy production. additionally, our shift to biomass-fuelled combined heat and power (chp) generation has played a pivotal role during this period. this shift continues to be characterised by the following: · growth in renewable capacity: in 2024, we continued to expand our renewable energy portfolio, reaching a total of 18.2 gw of installed ­capacity, with a pipeline of 7.6 gw in decided (fid’ed) ­capacity, reinforcing our commitment to advancing the global shift to renew- able energy in line with our long term ambition. · an increase in renewable energy generation and the phase-out of coal: we are on track to meet our 2025 target of a 99 % share of energy genera- tion coming from renewables. our coal generation ­activities were ceased in 2024. · capital alignment with climate goals: since the entry into force of the eu climate delegated act, 99 % of ørsted’s capital expenditures (capex) have been allocated to activities classified as sustainable. for 2024, these expenditures include dkk 37,867 million for the deployment of offshore and onshore wind capacity, dkk 6,097 million for the deployment of solar pv and energy storage 83 sustainability statements | environment ørsted annual report 2024 | esrs e1"
"technologies, and dkk 2,836 million for hydro- gen, carbon capture and storage, and bioenergy activities. · a measurable performance: we track and disclose progress of our renewable energy portfolio by monitoring progress towards our installed capacity ambition. in addition, we track and disclose pro- gress towards our decarbonisation efforts through a suite of sbti-validated climate targets, including near-term targets for 2025 and 2030 as well as long term targets for 2040. as part of the sbti valida- tion process of our interim targets, we updated the baseline year for our scope 1-2 emissions intensity target to 2018, replacing the original targets of reducing the scope 1-2 emissions intensity by 98 % by 2025 and by 99 % by 2030 from a 2006 base- line. from the updated 2018 baseline, we now aim to achieve a 93 % reduction in scope 1 and 2 ghg ­emissions intensity by 2025 and progress towards a 96 % reduction by 2030. our interim scope 1-3 ghg emissions intensity target outlines a reduction ­trajectory of ~77 % by 2030. these interim targets serve as critical waypoints that chart our overall pathway to achieving net-zero by 2040. · climate advocacy: as part of our efforts to advance policies and frameworks that accelerate the transi- tion to renewable energy, we actively engage with policy-makers and industry peers. addressing transition risks from locked-in emissions locked-in emissions refer to future emissions resulting from existing or planned infrastructure and assets. in our case, such emissions are tied to our gas sales ­activities. this is primarily due to our binding contractual obligations for offtake volumes of natural gas from the gas fields operated by the danish ­underground consortium (duc). we recognise the importance of tackling the impacts of our legacy business, as locked-in emissions pose a significant transition challenge if left unadressed. to guide progress toward our net-zero goals, we have set an absolute emissions reduction target for scope 3 emissions from gas sales, aiming to reduce emissions by ~67 % by 2030 (baseline 2018) and by ~90 % by 2040. to mitigate potential risks associated with locked-in emissions, we focus on the following: · measurable performance: we track and disclose progress towards our absolute reduction targets for gas sales. the targets are aligned with the 1.5 °c pathway, and we aim to remain on track to deliver on our net-zero ambition. · avoiding additional locked-in emissions: we do not enter into new gas sourcing agreements that would contribute to additional locked-in emissions. as a renewable energy company committed to driving the energy transition, we aim to address the challenges posed by our legacy business. these efforts reflect our commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040 and making a meaningful contribution to the global renewable energy transition. as of 31 december 2024, we are not excluded from the paris-aligned benchmark (pab), providing further evidence for the successful transition away from fossil fuels. second transition wave: decarbonising our supply chains having shown substantial progress in transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy gener- ation, we are now entering the second wave of our transformation: addressing emissions from our value chains. already today, power from offshore wind farms has 99 % lower ghg emissions than power from coal. however, the large scale of renewable energy projects creates both a need and an opportunity to further decarbonise, particularly by addressing emis- sions, such as steel production, maritime fuels, and manufacturing processes. achieving our 2040 net-zero target will require close collaboration with suppliers and industry peers. this wave is characterised by the following: · value chain decarbonisation road map: we con- tinuously revise and improve our company-wide decarbonisation roadmap to stay aligned with the latest developments and support informed decision-making. · active supplier engagement: we work closely with key suppliers to drive the integration of decarboni- sation into their strategies and operations. · partnerships: we work to establish strong partner­ ships and collaborate with key suppliers to support the decarbonisation of our value chain. strategic partnerships, such as our collaboration with ­dillinger, play a vital role in securing access to lower-emissions steel for critical components like offshore wind monopile foundations. · tracking and measuring: we continue to improve our in-house life cycle assessment capabilities to ­measure and monitor value chain emissions reductions effec- tively. we maintain detailed emissions reporting both internally and externally, with external reports being subject to limited assurance. governance and oversight of the transition plan matters related to the transition plan are addressed within our sustainability governance framework. the elements of our transition plan are fully disclosed in our annual report, which is presented to shareholders for approval at the annual general meeting (agm), providing them with an opportunity to offer feedback. the way forward our vision supported by our strategic ambition remains clear: to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. achieving this ambition requires us to remain attuned to a market environment increasingly shaped by national climate ambitions, regulatory developments, and the need to proactively identify and manage material sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities that influence our long term resilience and competitiveness. as the interlinkages between rising global tempera- tures, biodiversity loss, resource scarcity, and affected communities become more pronounced, they are driving shifts in demand, investment priorities, and expectations for corporate action. managing these sustainability-related dynamics is essential to main- taining our leadership in the energy transition and securing our organisation’s adaptability in a trans- forming market. 84 sustainability statements | environment ørsted annual report 2024 | esrs e1"
"we continue to leverage advanced technologies and scalable solutions to optimise renewable energy ­integration and supply chain decarbonisation, as outlined in our innovation report. additionally, as highlighted in our first climate advocacy report, we actively engage in shaping policies to align global energy needs with the 1.5 °c goal set by the paris agreement. the ­climate advocacy report includes an assessment of our most important industry associa- tions in terms of their alignment with this goal. guided by our ‘just transition policy’, we are commit- ted to inclusivity by safeguarding workers, support- ing communities, and protecting ecosystems as we advance the global energy transformation. by collab- orating closely with local communities, we strive to create opportunities, foster socio-economic growth, and ensure that the renewable energy transition is fair and brings meaningful benefits to all involved. through innovation, advocacy, and a focus on equity, we aim to lead this transition responsibly. // // esrs 2, sbm-3; e1, sbm-3 and iro-1 resilience analysis scope of the resilience analysis as a global leader in renewable energy, we employ a comprehensive approach to assessing and man- aging climate-related transition and physical risks, ensuring not only alignment with evolving regulatory requirements but also the resilience of our business model and strategy. thus, identifying and addressing climate-related impacts, risks, and opportunities are at the core of our vision to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. our approach to resilience analysis consists of two main components: 1. assessing and managing transition risks and oppor- tunities, which include macroeconomic, political, technological, and market developments associated with the global shift to a low-carbon economy. 2. conducting physical climate risk assessments to evaluate how climate-related hazards (chronic and acute), including extreme weather events and long- term climate changes, may impact our operations. transition risks and opportunities transition risks stem from a shift to a low-carbon economy and encompass factors such as new regu- lations, technological innovation, changing market dynamics, and shifting consumer preferences. over the past decades, we have effectively mitigated these risks by transforming our business model from fossil fuels to renewable energy, aligning our operations with a 1.5 °c climate trajectory. this proactive shift has positioned us well to capitalise on the increasing demand for renewable energy deployment. neverthe- less, we recognise that a key challenge to the overall industry is the possibility of insufficient political support for a continued renewable energy build-out, which is critical to the global energy transition. insufficient political or regulatory support for renewable energy deployment has also been assessed as part of the financial part of our double materiality assessment. transition risks are particularly relevant to our opera- tions in the us, where changes in investment conditions, reductions in subsidies, or shifting policy priorities could increase uncertainty for future projects. this is why transition plan highlights governance · board level oversight of transition efforts. · executive incentives linked to climate performance indicators. financial planning · capital alignment with climate goals and a 1.5 °c world – 99 % of capex allocated in 2024 is classified as sustainable. strategy · renewable energy deployment aligned with global, regional, and national level decarbonisation goals and a 1.5 °c pathway. targets · comprehensive suite of sbti-validated near-term and long-term climate targets (intensity and absolute), supported by ørsted-specific climate targets. scenario analysis · addressing climate-related physical and transition risks, such as extreme weather events and climate variability, and regulatory and political shifts, respectively. scope 1, 2, and 3 accounting with limited assurance · detailed greenhouse gas emissions reporting, which is subject to limited assurance. risks and opportunities · we monitor climate-related risks, such as changes in the regulatory and political landscape, and assess design safeguards and business case impacts. · renewable energy deployment as a busi- ness model to mitigate climate change. policy engagement · active engagement with policymakers, industry stakeholders, and communities to support the renewable energy transition. advocacy aligned with the goal of the paris agreement. value chain engagement · engaging key suppliers on climate, representing 50 % of procurement spend. vision · to create a world that runs entirely on green energy. 85 sustainability statements | environment ørsted annual report 2024 | esrs e1"
"we have not identified any material dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems, although soil stability at our sites constitutes the most significant dependency. regarding our transitional and physical risks, we have mapped out our exposure and have not found significant risks from biodiversity and ecosystems that are not already covered in our mitigation processes and biodiversity action plans. additionally, we have not identified any systemic risks to our business model that are not addressed through our established practices or the implementation of measures to reach our biodiversity ambition. a key outcome of our biodiversity programme has been the development of our ‘biodiversity measurement framework’, which will ensure that we can capture all potential impacts and risks to biodiversity and eco­ systems when developing new renewable energy pro- jects starting from 2024 and thus avoid the majority of impacts and risks to our operations. we have not completed an assessment of how ­systemic risks to society have been considered in the assessment of biodiversity and ecosystems-­related risks yet. however, we have begun the work of under- standing the correlation of these risks, how they impact our projects, and what we can do to mitigate them. the assessment of our upstream value chain that was completed in 2022 using the global ­biodiversity score tool is still relevant today. the results pro- vided an overview of impacts based on our most used ­materials (incl. minerals and metals) and how each material impacts the environment, focusing on biodiversity. the assessment did not include an assessment of how the biodiversity impacts from our upstream value chain affect local communities, but it did provide an essential first step in our work with the science based targets network (sbtn) frame- work and our progress towards being ready to set ­science-based targets for nature. our continuous work to identify and mitigate ­potential impacts and risks of our assets to biodiversity and ecosystems continues to inform our dma. in this pro- cess, we base the identification and scoring of iros on the knowledge gathered across all our offshore and onshore assets, enabling a cross-business assessment of impacts, risks, dependencies, and opportunities. management of impacts in our own operations at ørsted, we have sites located in or near biodiversity-­ sensitive areas. however, our activities at these sites only have temporary negative impacts during the ­construction phase, with no material impacts during operations, cf. the outcome of our dma. by following the steps of our new measurement framework, conducting environmental assessments, implementing appropriate mitigation measures, and applying our ‘biodiversity policy’, we will be able to avoid any impacts related to the deterioration of biodiversity or natural habitats within our own operations. we adhere to the mitigation hierarchy in the develop- ment of new projects, prioritising to avoid biodiversity impacts wherever feasible. for impacts that ­cannot be entirely avoided, we focus on minimising and ­mitigating them to the extent possible. an example of this is avoiding sensitive habitats during the routing of and installation of cables for offshore projects. post construction, any residual impacts that could not be fully mitigated are addressed through species-specific or habitat-specific restoration. these efforts aim to restore biodiversity and habitat functioning to at least pre-construction baseline levels and are our measures towards achieving a net-positive impact. this means that the majority of our impacts on bio­ diversity occur during the construction phase, and are appropriately mitigated, while during the operational phase, we have very limited impact on biodiversity that we are not able mitigate. one example of an impact that we are sometimes unable to mitigate during the operational phase of an offshore wind farm, which we have assessed as imma- terial, is the collision of airborne mobile species, such as birds or bats, with wind turbine blades. in cases where this impact cannot be mitigated through loca- tion or design, operational management plans are put in place, for example through enhanced monitor- ing campaigns, often in conjunction with local stake- holder groups. vulnerable species and critical habitat types are iden- tified during the early screening phase of a project, allowing us to plan our project development around these factors, implementing the mitigation hierarchy and ensuring we are undertaking the actions needed to avoid and mitigate impacts on biodiversity. // // e4, sbm-3 material impacts and opportunities related to biodiversity and ecosystems site locations in our own operations we have completed an assessment of all our opera- tional assets in collaboration with the biodiversity consultancy, using their biodiversity risk screening kit (brisk). this assessment focused on biodiversity- and ecosystem-related impacts, risks, dependencies, and opportunities at an asset level, helping us to better understand which sites are material in this respect. it takes a variety of factors into account that ­indicate impacts on biodiversity on a scale ranging from low over medium to high. these factors include species, designated areas (including protected areas and key biodiversity areas (kbas)), ecoregion intactness, water pollution, and marine habitats, amongst others. the assessment highlights a list of matters, indicating that there are potential negative impacts on biodiver- sity if nothing is done to avoid or mitigate these. from that output, we have found that the majority of the identified risks have already been identified through our eia or equivalent processes as well as mitigated as a part of our biodiversity action plans. therefore, we are taking all necessary steps to limit risks and negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosys- tems at all our site locations. when we identify over- laps with e.g. an iucn red-listed species, an action plan is developed to ensure that we do no significant harm to this species, nor any threatened species, both during construction and the operational phase. 111 sustainability statements | environment ørsted annual report 2024 | esrs e4"
"site locations without material impacts in total, we have 63 operational sites across our portfolio of renewable energy assets (i.e. offshore and onshore wind, solar pv, and power stations) that currently overlap with or are adjacent to protected areas or kbas. this is the majority of our assets and is connected to the fact that a buffer zone has been applied (25 km for offshore assets, 10 km for onshore assets), increasing the amount of overlaps with both protected areas and kbas. through our mitigation planning and restoration of impacts, we have found that we have no negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems at these sites. site locations with temporary material impacts in addition to the operational sites, we had 12 assets under construction in 2024, which were identified as material sites that temporarily have activities nega- tively affecting biodiversity-sensitive areas. these sites are listed in the table on page 114 and include nine off- shore wind and three solar pv projects. at the offshore construction sites, biodiversity impacts were primarily associated with monopile piling, which generates noise pollution, and cable laying, which disrupts ­benthic and intertidal habitats. additionally, the increased vessel traffic during construction caused further disruption to the ecosystem through noise pollution. for the solar pv assets under construction, ­biodiversity impacts were primarily due to land clearing and cable laying, which caused temporary habitat disruption and species displacement. additionally, the ­operation of machinery contributed to noise pollution. all these impacts are appropriately managed or mitigated through implementation of measures agreed through impact assessment and permitting processes. we have found no negative impacts related to land degradation during the operational phase of our projects, including desertification or soil sealing. any potential impacts on land degradation are mitigated during the construction phase. material impacts in our value chain we have identified material negative impacts in our upstream value chain. these impacts are primarily direct impact drivers of biodiversity loss due to extrac- tion of natural resources and mining activities. further- more, mining also has negative impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems and thus impacts spe- cies diversity. as mentioned previously, we used the global biodiversity score tool to obtain an overview of ­biodiversity- and ecosystems-related impacts in our upstream value chain, using global average data for our industry. we are dependent on mining of metals and minerals to expand the capacity of renewable energy assets, just as our peers in the industry. how- ever, we acknowledge the trade-offs of mining in the value chain, which we actively work towards manag- ing. as mentioned before, we are actively engaging with our tier 1 suppliers on their impacts on biodiver- sity, and we also continuously work towards gathering location-specific data on our upstream value chain. // // e4-2 policies related to biodiversity and ecosystems policy scope in 2024, we updated our ‘biodiversity policy’, which applies to all sites owned and operated by ørsted, including sites in or near biodiversity-sensitive areas. the policy addresses the direct impacts from our operations on biodiversity, ecosystem protection, and sustainable ocean practices. the scope of the policy covers all of ørsted’s renewable energy assets, both offshore and onshore, and includes our initial steps towards addressing biodiversity in our value chain and the associated dependencies. more specifically, we engage with some of our tier 1 suppliers on their progress on working with biodiversity, similar to our approach with decarbonisation. our biodiversity policy does not currently cover the impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems from e.g. raw material extraction in our upstream value chain. how- ever, we are committed to working with our suppliers through our ‘supply chain sustainability programme’ on mitigating their impacts on biodiversity, where we are currently engaging with our tier 1 suppliers. further tiers down in the value chain, it becomes more challenging to mitigate the inherent impacts on ­biodiversity and, on a broader scale, nature. through our supplier dialogues and continued work towards a more sustainable supply chain, we aim to implement mitigating actions for biodiversity in our supply chain in the future. the objective of our policy is to outline the importance of biodiversity to ørsted and how we believe that bio- diversity is a key part of a sustainable project life cycle. the policy also explains the steps we take to protect biodiversity throughout an asset’s life cycle, aiming to avoid potential impacts and risks to biodiversity – from planning and development, through construction, over operation and maintenance, and finally to the decom- missioning and potential repowering phases. policy governance accountability of the policy lies with the chief commercial officer (cco). to ensure that our policy is implemented and taken into account across our business, the policy includes an overview of the governance structure to support its implementation as well as specific third-party standards that support our work, e.g. the eu taxonomy for sustainable economic activities. interests of key stakeholders similar to the development of our biodiversity projects (see key actions below), we have also included key stakeholder concerns and interests into the scope of our biodiversity policy. for example, local communities, ngos, and academia are included in the stakeholder engagement steps during the various phases of an asset’s life cycle. management and mitigation hierarchy our business model is to develop, construct, operate, and own renewable assets, and we are committed to doing this in an environmentally and socially sustain- able way. however, we recognise that expanding our operations also implies a greater pressure on ­natural ecosystems. therefore, protecting and restoring these ecosystems must be part of the solution, and we remain fully committed to effectively manage our impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. biodiversity management is an integral part of our business model and decision-making processes throughout the full life cycle of our projects. this ranges from early-stage site selection and planning, over project design, construction, operations, and eventually to decommissioning.

strengthened the group executive team’s accountability for sustainability and delegated accountability of material sustainability areas to individual members of the group executive team in alignment with the sustainability topics defined in the esrs standards. the new governance integrates responsibility into the line organisation in ørsted to ensure a focused set-up with a strong mandate to execute on sustainability topics. the new accountable persons in the group executive team are individually accountable for driving progress on the assigned sustainability topic according to road- maps, including defining key actions and allocating resources to secure progress on targets and ambitions. they will be supported by supportive decision forums as well as internal experts from the support functions on sustainability topics. supportive decision forums the decarbonisation core group and the ­biodiversity & community impact core group will support the accountable persons in the group executive team in delivering on our strategic sustainability priority areas. the two new groups will kick off in 2025 and consist of the group executive team accountable person and senior leaders from functional areas with a clear role in delivering on the material sustainability matters. the groups have a tactical responsibility and decide on new sustainability initiatives needed to deliver on our ambitions and targets, guide implementation in the organisation, and act on iros. the core groups will meet two-three times a year or pending need. we are in the process of establishing a human rights task force, specifically focused on strengthening our due diligence systems to ensure compliance with the upcoming eu corporate sustainability due diligence directive (csddd). the task force will enable the implementation of a human rights management ­system and oversee its integration into relevant business processes to reach compliance. the task force will kick off in 2025 and consist of the group executive team accountable person as well as senior leaders representing ørsted’s value chain to ensure the value chain-wide approach of integrating human rights into management systems and processes. the task force will meet twice a year. the compliance committee monitors compliance with laws, rules, standards, and internal codes of conduct for all business areas. the qhse committee oversees our quality, health, safety, and environment (qhse) priorities and has a special focus on these aspects in relation to sustainability topics. business functions the business functions are responsible for executing on material sustainability iros. they deliver concrete actions on the ground to progress on our targets and ambitions while managing risks and capturing performance data. support functions the key support functions are corporate strategy, global sustainability, and group finance. the support functions assist all the accountable persons in

sustainability matters. // // esrs 2, gov-5 risk management and internal controls in preparation for the csrd, a plan was estab- lished to perform walkthroughs to identify risks, reassess existing controls, and identify additional controls for sustainability reporting. this initiative started in 2024 and will continue until the end of 2025. these walkthroughs of sustainability reporting processes were priori- tised based on the results of the dma performed in 2023 with reference to the draft esrs. priority is given to the quantitative data points related to our material esrs topics. the walkthroughs are facilitated by the internal control assurance team (second line of defence) in collaboration with functions involved in the sustainability reporting processes and data collection processes. the risks associated with the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the data as well as results of estimations and calculations are assessed based on materiality of the individual data points and process complexity. the walkthrough of the esrs ‘e1 climate change’ topic was finalised in 2024. it was con- firmed that main risks in data collection and reporting processes for material data points within this area have been mitigated by rele- vant controls. some controls required formal- isation, which has been completed in 2024. since january 2025, formalised controls for this area have been included in our ‘internal con- trol framework’ for financial and sustainability reporting processes to further monitor their design and operating effectiveness. the audit & risk committee monitors our ­sustainability reporting processes, including the plans for improvements, risks, internal controls, and their operating effectiveness. // 64 sustainability statements | general ørsted

"238 by reducing the specific scope 1 ghg emissions by 90%, and by reducing the intensity of scope 3 ghg emissions attributable to electricity sales by 98% relative to 2020 as the base year. ghg reduction goal 2050 – net zero: verbund is committed to achieving net zero ghg emissions from 2050 onwards (a reduction of at least 90% of greenhouse gas emissions and the elimination of residual emissions) starting in 2020 as the base year with the exclusion of ghg emissions generated by capital goods in order to achieve decarbonisation of the energy system (expansion of renewable energy). the aim is to reduce ghg emissions to an unavoidable minimum level and to use recognised actions to neutralise a maximum of 10% of residual emissions. indirect ghg emissions in category 2 are attributable at verbund to upstream ghg emissions from capital goods with the aim of decarbonising the energy system. these ghg emissions are reported transparently, but are excluded from the scope of the target, as the capital goods in question are aimed at increasing and diversifying renewable generation capacities, and expanding and modernising the electricity grid (for more information, see the taxonomy regulation disclosures in the eu taxonomy section). therefore, these targets are not consistent with the boundaries of the ghg inventory. these investments make an important contribution to the transition to clean energy, and are not linked to locked-in emissions. capital expenditure invested in grid expansion also facilitates the integration of new wind farms and photovoltaic installations. the verbund 2030 strategy provides for an expansion of renewable generation assets, grids and storage, which will lead to an increase in both the renewables generation capacity and in indirect ghg emissions in category 2 (capital goods) in the years these generation assets are brought into operation. reducing this emissions category is not compatible with verbund’s strategy of expanding the renewable energy sector. the expansion of renewable energies contributes to reducing verbund’s ghg emissions and those of many other companies and countries. sector coupling allows electricity generated from renewable energy sources to replace fossil fuels in the thermal energy and transport sectors. targets and actions aimed at expanding renewable energies, increasing energy efficiency and achieving the technological and geographical diversification of generation facilities are defined in order to manage further climate-related risks and opportunities. the levers for reducing ghg emissions by 2030 include reducing the use of fossil fuels, purchasing electricity from renewable energy for grid losses (where approved by the regulator) and distributing electricity from renewables generation to industrial customers. scope 1 accounts for 4%, scope 2 for 6%, and scope 3 for 90% of the total contributions to the target achievement of 74% (see also “ghg emissions table” under e1-6). in terms of net zero, the target for 2050 defined by verbund’s executive board is to achieve a reduction of at least 90% and remove residual emissions. the contributions to reducing scope 1 emissions are mainly achieved by replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen, for scope 2 by purchasing electricity from renewable energy for all energy consumption, and for scope 3 through further reductions in the supply chain. in the 2020 base year, a total of 6,258 kt co2e was calculated for scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions as well as scope 3 emissions. these emissions are used to calculate the reduction targets with the exclusion of category 2, with 6,242 kt co2e thereby serving as the basis for defining the target. the targets for the emissions intensity of electricity generation and electricity sales are based on the absolute targets. the intensity target for electricity generation refers to the ratio of scope 1 emissions from the electricity generation and electricity transport sector to total generation. the scope 3 intensity target is determined on the basis of the ratio of scope 3 emissions from the sale of purchased electricity to the total sales of electricity to consumers. accordingly, the target includes the emission sources associated"

"integrated annual report group management report 271 setting up environmentally optimised dam maintenance at the power plants in egglfing-obernberg, ering-frauenstein and braunau-simbach in bavaria. to minimise potential negative impacts of wind turbines on populations and habitats, independent environmental agencies and the related authorities have prescribed a range of actions to be taken as part of environmental assessments. for one, many sites require periodic monitoring of bird and bat populations, often in conjunction with related adjustments to operations and temporary plant shutdowns for certain observed species or specified circumstances, such as the harvest period for cornfields. environmental compensation areas are also being set up for birds of prey, owls, and other birds at certain sites, including mariengarten and göttlesbrunn, to provide substitute habitats that are extensively cultivated or planted with forage crops at a suitable distance from wind turbines. sections of the land may be mowed on a rare or partial basis to ensure cover is maintained for small mammals, deer and ground nesting species. another area in the green space is kept mown to provide a biotope where birds of prey can hunt. in order to promote biodiversity, (mineral) fertilisers and pesticides are not permitted in these compensation areas. following the construction phase of new wind farms, temporary access routes and crane parking spaces are reduced to a minimum and restored to their original condition. other measures related to wind farms include replacement or reforestation of prescribed tree species, as well as the protection and developmental upkeep of trees and shrubs. action plans have been established for open-field solar installations in austria and spain, both for the construction phase and for the operation of the installations. these related measures may be one-off or recurring, and follow the biodiversity mitigation hierarchy. for instance, to prevent negative impacts on biodiversity, construction times and any necessary clearing work are adapted to the breeding behaviour of native species, as is the case at the installations in mitterkirchen and ludmannsdorf. valuable habitats are not touched during construction or, where this is not possible, restored after construction. permeable fences are also built to facilitate the unhindered passage of wild animals, for example at the la solana installation in spain. restoration measures taken after the construction of installations include replanting native plants affected by the construction work. compensatory measures can include the establishment of insect hotels, wildflower strips on the edge of the installation, or planting new trees and shrubs on the installation land to create additional habitats. in austria, care is also taken to ensure extensive land cultivation without fertilisation and with the removal of mowed grass clippings. as part of mowing management, attention is paid to ensuring that animals such as partridges remain protected by visual cover and to the management of non-native and invasive species. an example of this approach can be found at the photovoltaic installation in güssing, which opened in 2024. austrian power grid ag and gas connect austria gmbh also take measures to maintain and promote biodiversity and base their actions on the mitigation hierarchy as a matter of course. this helps to both minimise the environmental impacts in relation to the grid and avoid unnecessary environmental impacts from the outset. in addition to statutory requirements, special consideration is given to species protection in projects undertaken by gas connect austria gmbh. as part of its sustainable habitat management, austrian power grid ag has a long history of implementing environmental and species protection measures in relation to the power grid that go far beyond the stringent legal requirements. the gas connect austria gmbh gas network and the austrian power grid ag electricity grid lead through various landscape areas in austria. depending on the region, the climate, the naturally occurring circumstances and the type of use by humans, austrian power grid ag and gas connect austria gmbh routes pass through various landscapes, including forests, grasslands and farmland. the route corridors not only contain the power lines and pipelines, but also provide valuable habitats for flora and fauna."
"272 when planning the construction of new gas pipelines and high-voltage power lines, the aim is always to plan the route such that it avoids sensitive areas (nature reserves, bird sanctuaries, biotopes, natural and archaeological monuments, etc.). if this is not possible, nature conservation experts are consulted to determine whether interfering with nature can be avoided to the greatest possible extent. at gas connect austria gmbh, biodiversity measures include ecological site supervision, compliance with guidelines for proper soil recultivation, reforestation, regulatory monitoring, management of non- native and invasive species, relocation of protected species and wildlife corridors. at austrian power grid ag, for example, cef measures have been introduced to ensure the continuous ecological functionality of the habitats in which the wood grouse is found. in addition, numerous amphibian spawning grounds along with nesting areas and woodpiles have been established to compensate for encroaching on the terrestrial ecosystem. bird conservation is of particular importance for austrian power grid ag. when constructing overhead line systems, special care is taken to observe the breeding periods of rare species along with other measures. numerous nesting aids for endangered bird species have been installed on electricity pylons and around lines. for example, if the habitat of gophers is affected during line construction, they are temporarily resettled for the duration of the construction work until their habitat is restored. nature and species protection experts as well as local residents contribute their experience in resettling the gophers. compensatory measures and spaces are defined in the planning phase and are legally secured through land purchases or long-term lease agreements. current biodiversity measures in connection with construction projects are reported for austrian power grid ag in the year during which new installations are put into initial operation. every year, experts from various specialist fields are invited to participate in the austrian power grid ag nature conservation meeting to share their experiences, engage in scientific debate and talk to stakeholders. verbund has been implementing a wide range of decarbonisation measures and is indirectly working to mitigate biodiversity loss by expanding renewable energy generation and reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. please consult section e1 climate change for more information. metrics and targets disclosure requirement e4-4 – targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems verbund has set itself the goal of investing around €400m between 2002 and 2027 in environmental measures such as constructing fish passes and restoring stretches of rivers. by the end of 2024, €194m had already been allocated to corresponding measures, as described in the previous section. of the 92 installations required to ensure fish passage at present, 71 had achieved fish passability by the end of 2024. in base year 2021, upon the launch of the third national river basin management plan in austria, this figure stood at 66. by 2027, 89 installations are expected to be passable, subject to the timely receipt of the required public permits. both corporate targets include verbund hydro power gmbh, grenzkraftwerke gmbh and verbund innkraftwerke gmbh as well as ennskraftwerke ag. they primarily address the impacts of hydropower on the river ecosystem, particularly on the historically altered river morphology, the barrier function, and the associated impacts on the development of the fish population. the targets cover the catchment areas of the danube, drau, salzach, enns, mur and inn rivers in austria and bavaria. these targets have been allocated to the restoration step of the mitigation hierarchy. restoring the passability of major rivers is one of the objectives set out in the european water framework directive. this directive was enshrined in austrian law by the third national river basin"
"integrated annual report group management report 273 management plan in 2021 and in germany by the coordinated management plan (2022–2027). among other things, the plans specify which stretches of river are to be morphologically restored to achieve good ecological condition or good ecological potential of the surface water bodies, and where measures for passability and residual water discharges need to be implemented. the international and national requirements are based on ecological thresholds for river basins. verbund uses these findings to improve its knowledge and contributes to the sustainable use and improvement of bodies of water through its targets and actions. in addition, verbund targets are linked to the restoration of freshwater ecosystems objective set in the eu biodiversity strategy. fish and all organisms found in and around the water habitat benefit from fish passes and the many bypass channels around them. ecological thresholds for monitoring the functionality of fish passes are set forth by the responsible federal ministry in the form of guidelines. the functionality of fish passes and compliance with the requirements must be verified by verbund in the context of monitoring and corresponding reports. in bavaria, the technical university of munich carries out comprehensive functionality monitoring in coordination with the bavarian state ministry of the environment and consumer protection. if compensation measures are required in relation to the implementation of semi-natural projects (e.g. for clearing work to reconnect silted distributaries), these are ordered by the authorities and executed alongside project implementation. however, these measures are not subject to any set targets. sustainability commitments have been developed for wind and photovoltaics, including biodiversity commitments. through these commitments, verbund aims to achieve biodiversity net gains by 2030 for wind and photovoltaic projects. specific targets for biodiversity net gains in the construction and operation of installations are currently being developed on the basis of these commitments. these targets include the development of comprehensive biodiversity concepts for wind farms and open-field solar installations. the aim is to not only minimise the negative impacts of infrastructure projects on the environment, but also to actively contribute to promoting biodiversity and creating sustainable habitats. for further business areas, compliance with policies and the implementation of measures related to biodiversity will be ensured through environmental management systems, annually updated action plans, monitoring requirements and the schedule of legal provisions, as well as through external certifications. these plans concern one-off, ongoing measures to be implemented at defined intervals. progress of the measures is documented at least once a year. disclosure requirement e4-5 – impact metrics related to biodiversity and ecosystems change at verbund, 128 sites with a potential negative impact on protected areas are located in or near biodiversity sensitive areas (see table for e4 sbm 3). of this amount, 6,242 hectares comprise land that is either owned by verbund or which is under third-party ownership with easements (servitude) for verbund. the number of fish passes completed is used as a metric for determining changes in the passability of rivers. as of the end of 2024, a total of 71 verbund power plant sites, including ennskraftwerke ag, were passable for fish. this corresponds to 76% of the run-of-river power plants. plans for a further eleven run- of-river power plants are already in the advanced stage, and completion is planned for 2025 and 2026. construction of the fish passes at the rosenheim power plant (inn river), the laufnitzdorf and bodendorf power plants (mur river), as well as the landl (enns river) and sölk power plants (donnersbach river) is scheduled to begin in 2025. the metric “number of fish passes” covers both the restoration of the"

"integrated annual report group management report 275 disclosure requirement e5-1 – policies related to resource use and circular economy at verbund, the management of impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy is of importance when it comes to keeping primary resource consumption to a minimum while maximising the circularity of waste streams. a comprehensive group-wide approach to conserving resources and the circular economy is yet to be established as the related direct impacts on the environment are considered to be low compared to the other environmental topics. however, verbund has launched an analysis process to evaluate the aspects of the circular economy relevant to the group. the aim is to develop a circular economy strategy that generates both environmental and economic benefits for society and for verbund. the verbund executive board has already adopted and regularly updates executive orders that define responsibilities and areas of responsibility in relation to materials management and sustainability management within the group. the following ecological criteria have been established to support the transition to a circular economy at verbund: responsible use of natural raw materials and resources. verbund records the proportion of renewable energy sources in its total energy consumption and monitors the development of energy consumption and materials on an annual basis. waste management represents another important topic. verbund is committed to ensuring the prevention, recovery, reuse, and proper collection and treatment of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. as a result, all waste is handed over for appropriate recovery or disposal. verbund is focused on optimising its existing operational processes and efficiently reducing waste streams. following the coal phase-out, the volume of waste generated has been on the decline. however, greater waste streams are expected in the long term due to recent photovoltaic and wind installations. waste management at verbund follows the principles of the european union’s five-step waste hierarchy: waste prevention before preparation for reuse, before recycling, before recovery and before disposal. the verbund group waste coordinator and their deputy monitor waste management and provide advice based on the verbund waste management work instruction. the group waste coordinators are responsible for administration and knowledge management with regard to waste management at verbund. they review the appointment of waste officers and their deputies on an annual basis, assist with submitting reports to the authorities, update work instructions, identify training needs, organise trainings and hold coordination meetings. responsibility for compliance with the legal requirements rests with the respective managers. procurement takes place in accordance with the specially defined executive order for materials management and the verbund procurement guidelines, which stipulate that materials management must be carried out in accordance with the business principles and with due regard to the corporate mission statement, the corporate objectives and sustainability. accordingly, economic, environmental and social criteria must be taken into account in award decisions, both for procurement and for sales. in addition to the executive orders, a supplier code of conduct (scoc) has been established for the management of resource inflows to ensure resource-efficient waste and materials management at verbund and all subsidiaries. resource inflows related to procurement are subject to this supplier code of conduct (scoc). among other things, the group-wide scoc provides recommendations for verbund contractors on resource use and circular economy. the scoc applies to all suppliers and business partners that supply products or services to the group, including both domestic and"

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 134 to reach the target level of ghg emissions, continental has identified two primary decarbonization levers. › continued purchase of green electricity: continental purchases electricity exclusively from renewable energy sources. various contractual instruments are used for this purpose, which are listed in the corresponding metrics. continuation of this approach allows the avoidance of market-based scope 2 ghg emissions from electricity consumption. › technological transformation: this lever is closely linked to the operational processes and is formalized in the technology trans- formation roadmaps of the individual group sectors. it consists primarily of the sub-levers such as the phase-out of coal, the gradual phase-out of other fossil fuels, the switch to biofuels and biomass as well as increased electrification of production pro- cesses that were previously run on fossil fuels. according to continental’s assessment, the targeted ghg reductions will be fully, i.e. to 100 %, achieved through combination of the two aforementioned decarbonization levers. the two levers are inextrica- bly linked, and both have a simultaneous effect on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. any further breakdown of the contributions into scope 1 and scope 2 is therefore not meaningful. continental sees the increase in energy efficiency and the expansion of capacities for self-generation of electricity from renewable sources primarily not as direct, but as supporting levers for target achieve- ment. continental is of the opinion that the implementation of these levers with the speed required to achieve the target is in line with the 1.5°c pathway as set out in the original target setting. the operationalization of these decarbonization levers through the key actions is reflected in the decarbonization roadmap 2040, with which continental is creating a framework for target achievement. continental’s progress regarding the set emissions reduction target can be derived from the metric “combined own scope 1 and market- based scope 2 ghg emissions.” progress is measured using the defined metric, which was fully adapted to the esrs requirements in 2024. in 2024, there were no significant changes to the business model and business activities that could potentially affect the target achievement. in continental’s opin- ion, progress towards achieving the target by 2024 is in line with the original plans."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 126 material impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change continental assessed its potential and actual negative and positive impacts as well as risks and opportunities related to sustainability according to the regulatory requirements and as described in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section. the general disclosures in- clude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks and opportunities (iros), including the time horizons considered. in this iro assessment, the following material potential and actual negative and positive impacts, risks and opportunities have been identified in relation to climate change. they have been grouped into iro clusters for easier understanding and reading. the descrip- tions of the negative impacts and risks are presented from a gross perspective which, on the basis of the applied methodology, does not take into account mitigation through the management ap- proaches of continental as described in the respective iro cluster. this perspective is used to determine where appropriate manage- ment approaches are relevant and corresponding reporting is re- quired. as positive impacts as well as opportunities are strength- ened by continental’s management approaches, the descriptions are presented from a net perspective which, for methodical rea- sons, considers the results of the management approaches. the descriptions of the iros are to be regarded as self-contained, which may result in repetitions. risks 6, 7 and 9 represent climate-related physical risks. the re- maining identified risks are transition risks. scope 1 and scope 2 emissions › continental has moderate scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emis- sions in own operations which contribute to global climate change and are therefore considered relevant for corporate re- sponsibility.

(see esrs 2, iro table, risk 10) › continental operates in regions and industries where a moderate increase in investment and operating costs related to climate change mitigation (e.g. transformation of production sites) or reg- ulatory requirements (e.g. trading schemes) can be expected es- pecially in the medium-term. this risk is considered relevant for the information needs of users of sustainability reporting. (see esrs 2, iro table, risk 12) › continental operates in regions and industries where, in the un- likely event of regulation allowing no or only limited overshoot of a 1.5°c temperature increase, a significant increase in investment and operating costs related to climate change mitigation can be expected especially in the medium-term.

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 128 resilience analysis the analysis of the resilience of continental’s strategy and business model to the climate change along the entire value chain is inte- grated into the general iro assessment (see subsection overview of material impacts, risks and opportunities in the general disclo- sures (esrs 2) section). in the process of identifying and assessing risks and opportunities as part of the general iro assessment, continental took into con- sideration several factors and scenarios. the scenarios are de- scribed in the subsection specifics of the iro assessment in rela- tion to climate change in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section. the use of scenarios and assumptions by definition leads to uncer- tainties in the outcome of the analysis. further factors considered included especially the following: reduced overall emissions of greenhouse gases (ghg) and reduced energy consumption due to a switch of fuels towards low-carbon alternatives, enhanced energy efficiency, increased deployment of renewable energy, higher pro- duction share of zero-tailpipe-emission vehicles as well as different speeds of transition to low-carbon technologies. to assess the resili- ence of continental’s business model to the identified risks and op- portunities, a net assessment was carried out considering the exist- ing management approaches, targets and key actions to achieve the targets related to climate change. based on the iro assessment considering the associated limita- tions, uncertainties, time horizons and assumptions as outlined in subsection process for identifying and assessing material iros in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section as well as taking into ac- count the management approaches continental considers its busi- ness model and strategy to be resilient. the management ap- proaches, targets and key actions laid out in this section for achiev- ing the targets describe continental’s capability to reduce its mate- rial negative impacts, increase positive impacts, manage risks and seize opportunities over short-, medium- and long-term. continental also assumes that these capabilities will continue to develop over time."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 129 management approaches to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency and renewable energy regarding climate change, continental has implemented manage- ment approaches that include the following iro clusters: scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition, climate change adaptation, and supply chain resilience and transition. the following table illustrates the topic areas that are addressed by the specific management approaches. climate change mitigation climate change adaptation energy efficiency renewable energy deployment scope 1 and scope 2 emissions x x x scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition x x x climate change adaptation x supply chain resilience and transition x x scope 1 and scope 2 emissions continental pursues the ambition of achieving full carbon neutrality for its own operations by 2040 and for the entire value chain by 2050 at the latest. to support this ambition, continental has imple- mented a management approach that focuses on minimizing nega- tive environmental impacts and risks in relation to scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions. the management approach also ad- dresses the minimization of transition risks related to scope 1 and scope 2. the management approach for scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emis- sions covers the entire continental group and focuses especially on the production sites, as they are particularly emission-intensive compared to other types of locations. responsibility for the operational implementation of the manage- ment approach to reduce ghg emissions lies with the respective legal entities. the local management is supported by various func- tions in the organization, e.g. by the departments such as opera- tions, infrastructure, real estate management and purchasing. the group’s internal framework is defined by the responsible depart- ments (e.g. environment and operations) of continental and is mon- itored by the executive board of the overall group as well as the in- dividual group sector boards. continental has established several processes to continuously re- duce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, to promote the transition to carbon neutrality and to create a framework for specific quantified targets and measures. continental pursues a ghg reduction target covering scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions. progress is monitored through regularly reported emission values (see subsection targets related to climate change). the process includes dedicated ghg data analyses at various organizational levels and – where neces- sary – updates to the target paths. the results are regularly pre- sented to the sustainability steering committee. ghg emission data serves as the basis for the creation of an overarching decar- bonization roadmap 2040 (see subsection key actions for target achievement), which provides a framework for implementing the necessary measures and is regularly updated based on actual emission values. continuous calibration of the levers required to pursue the target path is a key element of the roadmap process. the decarbonization roadmap 2040 applies to the whole conti- nental group and is further operationalized in the group sectors through their own roadmaps for technology transition. formalized regular exchange on best practices (e.g. by functions such as infra- structure and environment) supports the implementation of tech- nical solutions and the corresponding program management within continental’s group sectors. the implementation of the decarbonization roadmap 2040 is also supported by measures to optimize energy consumption and en- ergy costs. this also includes the expansion of capacities for the in- house generation of electricity from renewable sources as a substi- tute for the external purchase of green electricity (see subsection key actions for target achievement). general increases in energy ef- ficiency (e.g. through led lighting) are part of the continuous im- provement processes within the local environmental and energy management systems. regarding the risk of a devaluation of its own real estate because of climate change mitigation regulations, continental is striving to increase transparency regarding its real estate portfolio. to this end, a system that provides information on esg-relevant real estate data (including the ghg emissions caused by the operation of the build- ings) was tested at some pilot locations and in some acquisition transactions in the reporting year."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 132 responsibility for compliance with the relevant processes lies with continental’s purchasing and supply chain management functions, which are supported by internal risk management. the processes are monitored as part of general business supervision at various or- ganizational levels. management of the climate-related aspects of supply chain resili- ence and transition is integrated into the general processes for managing supply chain resilience. these processes are handled closely to the operational business and are integrated into the gen- eral practices regarding purchasing, supply chain management and risk management on different levels of the organization. various as- pects are considered during the procurement process, including strategic factors such as security of supply in the event of extreme weather events, which could be exacerbated by climate change. further information on the relevant processes can be found in the report on risks and opportunities section of the management report. the processes are guided by a set of general rules for the related functions on different levels of the organization. the management approach is not based on a specific external set of rules. close dialogue with customers and suppliers is a key element of the management approach. as the processes are implemented close to operational business, communication with internal stakeholders takes place mainly within the respective businesses. the primary form of external communication is close dialogue with customers and suppliers."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 133 targets related to climate change following its sustainability ambition, continental has set a public sus- tainability target (pst) related to climate change that aims at the re- duction of scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions to an absolute value of 0.5 million metric tons of co2 equivalent (million tco2e) by 2035. the interim target for 2030 is to reduce scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions to 0.7 million tco2e. both the main and the interim target are set as absolute values and measured in millions of metric tons of co2 equivalents (million tco2e). the formalized target commitment to reduce scope 1 and market- based scope 2 ghg emissions is a key element of the corresponding management approach to scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and the subsequent key actions. the transition towards and, in the end, the achievement of the target allows continental to mitigate negative im- pacts and risks connected to scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions. the target covers the combined scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions. in view of the relatively low amount of remaining mar- ket-based scope 2 ghg emissions (see subsection key actions for tar- get achievement), the reduction of scope 1 ghg emissions is a partic- ular focus and will contribute the major share to the ghg emissions reductions. the target value was defined in alignment with the guid- ance of the ghg protocol on calculating scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions and includes the greenhouse gases de- scribed in the metric “combined own scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions.” consequently, the greenhouse gases cov- ered by the target and considered in the metrics are consistent with the limits of the greenhouse gas inventory. the scope of the main and interim targets extends to the continental group’s own operations. the original target trajectory was developed using the base year 2019. the originally publicly reported baseline value amounted to 3.2 million tco2e for scope 1 and location-based scope 2 ghg emissions. the chosen base year is representative in terms of external factors af- fecting the energy consumption and hence, ghg emissions. due to a relevant change to the company structure in 2021 as well as the in- troduction of the market-based approach for the reporting of scope 2 ghg emissions, a comparable reference value for the base year 2019 was re-modeled ex-post, and is estimated to around 2.8 million tco2e. continental points out that there are uncertainties connected to the data model. in 2024, by decision of the sustainabil- ity steering committee, the target was reconfirmed without changes to the target value, target pathway or target year. the baseline values for the reconfirmed target can be seen in the metric “combined own scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions.” the metric com- plies with the esrs requirements for the calculation of scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions. continental is of the opinion that the set scope 1 and scope 2 target is based on scientific evidence. it should be noted that relevant uncer- tainty remains regarding the breakdown of the global reduction path- way in line with the 1.5°c scenario down to the company level. greater uncertainties are also associated with the allocation of the co2 budgets to the various industrial sectors and the extent to which of so-called negative emissions (co2 removals) can be used if the 1.5°c path is exceeded to a limited extent. continental’s climate target was reviewed by the science based targets initiative (sbti) in 2020, using the original base year 2019 as a benchmark. a re-validation by the sbti did not take place. based on the continental’s ambition to achieve carbon neutrality in own operations by 2040 at the latest and on the applied methodology, linear derivations of the required emis- sions values for the year 2030 were validated and confirmed as being compliant with the paris agreement. considering the modeled refer- ence value and the updated pathway, continental views its emissions reduction target to be still in line with the level of ambition of the origi- nal reduction pathway. the target setting followed the methodology of an absolute reduction as described by sbti in the framework “foundations of science-based target setting (version 1.0)”, including the defined underlying climate and policy scenarios. the derivation was based on a cross-sector emissions pathway. no anticipated external developments and their impact on green- house gas emissions were explicitly considered when setting the tar- get. significant changes to continental’s company structure, product portfolio or production volumes might lead to the adjustment of the target values. in 2024, no changes were made to the target values. when setting the target, continental considered the interests of differ- ent stakeholders (such as customers, authorities), e.g. by applying the sbti methodology."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 130 the framework for the management approach for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions is set by internal climate protection rules, the decarbonization roadmap 2040 and the sustainability ambition. within the management approach and local management systems, the standards iso 14001 (environmental management systems) and iso 50001 (energy management systems) are applied. the calculation and reporting of ghg emissions are carried out in ac- cordance with the standards set by the ghg protocol. furthermore, multiple climate change mitigation agreements (e.g. the paris agreement) as well as regulatory requirements (e.g. the eu emis- sions trading system) serve as references. the management approach for scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emis- sions considers the global interest in climate change mitigation of various stakeholders. the expectations and requirements of cus- tomers and capital markets to make a positive contribution to cli- mate change mitigation through their value chains are at the fore- front. communication of the management approach takes place inter- nally via various conferences and publications on the company- wide intranet. the management approach is communicated to ex- ternal stakeholders by means of sustainability reporting, press re- leases, dialogues with customers and investors, as well as trade fairs. scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition the management approach for scope 3 emissions, portfolio resili- ence and transition aims to support continental on its path to car- bon neutrality along the entire value chain by 2050 at the latest. as described in the iros (see subsection material impacts, risks and opportunities related to climate change), continental operates in in- dustries that are undergoing major changes. the main objective of the management approach is to successfully steer own operations, taking into account the different transformation speeds of our cus- tomers, sectors and markets. the management approach encompasses the entire continental group, its global portfolio and covers all 15 categories of scope 3 ghg emissions as defined by the ghg protocol. the focus here is on the most relevant categories associated with the use phase of the products sold (category 11) and the carbon backpack. it in- cludes especially purchased goods and services (category 1), capi- tal goods (category 2) and emissions at the end of the life cycle (category 12). steering and adaptation of the respective portfolio take place in the responsible business functions, e.g. research and development (r&d), product design, supply chain management and purchasing. these are supported by the sustainability departments. oversight of the portfolio management is exercised by the executive board through, for example, the strategy process. the management approach comprises processes to create trans- parency, identify levers and implement relevant measures. the basis for the management of scope 3 emissions, portfolio resil- ience and transition is the transparency with regard to the 15 cate- gories of scope 3 ghg emissions and our portfolio of zero-tailpipe- emission vehicles. levers to reduce emissions are identified on a continuous basis in the respective processes, with a focus on the use phase and the carbon backpack. the mitigation of material risks and impacts from the use phase of products is primarily related to managing the portfolio resilience and transition in the respective businesses. important related pro- cesses are market monitoring, optimization of r&d activities, active portfolio management and a close dialogue with customers. this also includes regular assessments of the transferability of the port- folio on the path to carbon neutrality. for scope 3 ghg backpack emissions, the core resource inflow as- pects related to the purchased goods, services and capital goods are mainly managed within the relevant functions. the correspond- ing management practices include, for example, selection of less emission-intensive materials and suppliers, the active supplier de- velopment and the commitment of suppliers to climate change mit- igation. these practices are integrated in our general procurement and supplier management processes, which are managed by the purchasing functions. in addition, product design that focuses on reducing the carbon footprint of products is another measure that is handled by the product development and r&d departments. aspects in connection with the emissions at the end of the life cy- cle are mainly managed within product design processes, e.g. by fo- cusing on easier disassembly for reutilization and developing less emission-intensive recycling methods (see resource use and circu- lar economy (esrs e5) section). further potential for minimizing emissions lies in optimizing the transportation of goods, business travel and employee commuting as well as other processes in con- nection with the carbon backpack. continental’s sustainability ambition sets the overarching frame- work for the definition and implementation of measures. for the dif- ferent business process, further internal rules apply directly or indi- rectly addressing climate change mitigation. in addition, the management approach is based on the ghg proto- col and related standards (e.g. corporate value chain (scope 3) ac- counting and reporting standard) as external frameworks for co2 emissions accounting. the management approach and associated measures take into consideration in particular the requirements of customers and the requests of investors. consultations and dialogue with suppliers are key elements for the implementation of carbon backpack-related levers."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 131 continental communicates its approach to managing scope 3 emissions as well as portfolio resilience and transition externally through reporting, trade fairs, press releases and investor dialogue. internal communication takes place via various channels such as sustainability and product-related conferences, working groups and the company-wide intranet. climate change adaptation to mitigate the risks of a devaluation of the real estate portfolio and of rising operating costs and investments due to physical climate change, continental has established management approaches that cover the processes for selecting real estate and company loca- tions as well as technical measures for adapting new production sites and measures aimed at changing the behavior of employees. these approaches cover continental’s own operations. the focus is on assets that may bear certain limitations in terms of their adapta- bility and on potential new locations. the primary responsibility for the implementation of the risk miti- gation measures lies with the operational business, supported by various functions within the organization, e.g. real estate manage- ment, continental insurance services as well as technical depart- ments specialized in buildings and infrastructure. when selecting new operating sites, continental considers, among other things, risks associated with existing exposure to extreme weather events, which could be exacerbated by physical climate change. to avoid these potential new risks by adding new locations to the real estate portfolio, continental has included corresponding requirements in its guidelines for the selection process for new lo- cations. the aim of these requirements is to gain knowledge about the exposure of assets considered to a variety of weather events and other natural disasters and to incorporate the results of the as- sessment in the final decision. in the existing real estate portfolio, the climate conditions are moni- tored at the respective locations. as part of the improvement and optimization of production processes and working conditions, the sites assess cost-efficient options for heating, cooling and ventila- tion case-by-case, considering the potential for reducing energy costs and other operating costs, which is particularly relevant in re- lation to risks associated with long-term climate change (such as rises in temperature). respective measures are implemented locally within regular site management processes and in alignment with the centrally supporting departments. an additional lever for curbing the increasing operating costs is to raise employee’s awareness of the impact that individual behavior patterns have on the development of the overall energy demand. the implementation of this lever includes, for example, various training courses and campaigns promoting the importance of the responsible use of energy to reduce the costs related to heating, cooling, and ventilation. in addition, risk reduction regarding certain natural hazards and ex- treme weather events, considering the given current exposure, is part of the location-related actuarial risk management process with the resulting organizational and technical measures. responsibility for implementing these measures lies with the operating business. the selection process for new locations and the management of the real estate portfolio follow the general internal rules. conti- nental also has its own requirements for building construction and operation, which consider factors such as insulation, for example. in addition, the decarbonization roadmap 2040 described in the management approach for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions pro- vides a supporting set of rules for reducing the costs of cooling, heating, and ventilation. the management approach relies on international standards iso 14001 and iso 50001 related to energy management and the technical requirements of the buildings, including the consideration of local regulatory requirements. in the processes of implementation of the management approach regarding climate change adaptation, especially the interests of continental's employees regarding working conditions (e.g. temper- ature and fresh air) at the relevant locations are considered. communication with employees generally takes place at location level. detailed information on the general forms of engagement and communication with employees are included in the own work- force (esrs s1) section. supply chain resilience and transition with the management approach for supply chain resilience and transition, continental aims to ensure continuity in the supply chains, prevent interruptions and successfully reduce the cost pres- sure associated with the transition. in this connection, continental strives to strengthen the overall resilience of the supply chain and thus to be prepared to manage the risks that arise in certain supply chains in the medium and long term. the management approach for supply chain resilience and transi- tion focuses on the continental group’s upstream value chain, and particularly on the direct supplier base. there are no geographical restrictions or product group limitations."

scope 3 ghg emissions are calculated in alignment with the corporate value chain (scope 3) accounting and reporting standards 2011 and the supplement standards. definitions, assumptions, and calculation methods total calculated gross indirect (scope 3) ghg emissions - total of categories (1) to (15). calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – purchased goods and services - purchased goods and services relate to the extraction, production and transportation of goods purchased by the company in the reporting year. only the goods and services relevant for category 1 according to the ghg protocol are considered, including all upstream emissions (cradle-to-gate). - emissions for goods are calculated on a weight basis and for services on a cost basis. the emission factors of sphera solutions gmbh or internally determined group sector-specific and business area-specific ghg factors are used to calculate the emissions. - for purchased product groups for which not all weight data is available, the missing proportion is extrapolated using the average method. the expenditures for services are multiplied either by the specific emission factors from defra or by an internally determined emission factor. within this expenditure-based method, the data is extrapolated for a small share. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – capital goods - capital goods that are purchased in the reporting year are considered. - the expenditures for capital goods are multiplied either by the specific emission factors from defra or by an internally determined emission factor. as part of this expenditure-based method, the data for a small share is extrapolated. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – energy and fuel-related activities (not included in scopes 1 and 2) - energy- and fuel-related activities are defined as extraction, production, transportation, and transportation losses of purchased fuels and energy that are not covered by scope 1 or scope 2. - for energy consumption, the specific emission factors from defra are used within the framework of an average data method. - the country-specific power grid emission factors are calculated based on the defra calculation method. for this category, well-to-tank emission factors are considered. - an average transmission loss of 5 % as recommended by defra for steam and district heat is applied. - in the case of renewable electricity, it is assumed that the mix consists of 50 % photovoltaics and 50 % wind power. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – upstream transportation and distribution - upstream transportation and distribution are defined as the transportation of goods from direct suppliers to the company as well as within the company and to the customer, if paid for by the company and using third-party vehicles and facilities, including emissions from transportation services. - for this category, average data, costs and ghg data from service providers are applied using the distance-based method, with the missing share extrapolated. - apart from co2 data from service providers, the emissions for each mode of transport (road, rail, sea, and air) were determined through calculations, whereby a small proportion of the transport modes are estimated. - the basis for calculation includes logistics expenses, weight distance and transport equipment multiplied by the specific emission factors from sphera solutions gmbh or defra. - the emissions of the contitech group sector are primarily calculated based on the ghg data from service providers. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – waste generated in operations - waste generation is multiplied by specific emission factors from defra using an average data method for different waste categories, only considering emissions associated with landfill sites and incinerators. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – business travel - travel booking service providers report ghg emissions for business trips. hotel overnight stays are included as optional data. the various travel options are also considered and calculated. - some of these external primary data refer to emission factors from defra or vehicle manufacturers. - business travel that may not have been booked through these service providers is considered by an estimate based on an expert assumption. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – employee commuting - daily commuting time and modes of transport are based on an external global survey. - for this average-data method, the emissions are calculated on the basis of the estimated commuting distance, effective number of working days and the number of employees together with the defra emission factors."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 141 calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – upstream leased assets - continental ag is using management control as a consolidation approach. therefore, there are no scope 3 emissions allocated to leased assets. these are only reported under scopes 1 and 2. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – downstream transportation and distribution - downstream transportation and distribution are defined as emissions from the transportation and distribution of products after the point of sale, including retail and storage. - the logistics paid for by the customers are extrapolated from continental’s own outbound logistics emissions from “upstream transportation and distribution”, based on the share of selfpickers determined by total sales or product weight. - the emission factors from the “upstream transportation and distribution” category are applied. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – processing of products sold - processing of sold products covers the processing of intermediate products sold in the reporting year to downstream companies. - for the automotive and contitech group sectors, the calculation only considers emissions that are related to the material handling and general assembly stages of continental products. taking the product weight sold and the average vehicle weight based on market data, a virtual vehicle quantity is modeled in this average-data method. this virtual vehicle quantity is multiplied by the scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions per vehicle manufactured by selected automotive manufacturers. - the calculation model used in the tires group sector considers the energy consumption per tire assembly, which was determined by measurements and calculations for passenger car and truck tires in various processing steps. - the calculation relates exclusively to continental’s vehicle business. the industrial business within the contitech group sector and the trading business of the tires and automotive group sectors are not included, as these emissions are not considered relevant in terms of their magnitude. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – use of sold products - this category includes the indirect emissions from the contitech and tires group sectors during the use phase, which are optional to be reported according to the ghg protocol. for the automotive group sector, some products, particularly electronic products, consume electricity during their use phase and could be classified as direct emissions from the use phase. for this category, tank-to-wheel emission factors are used. - indirect emissions in the retail business of the automotive group sector and parts of the specialty tires, non-tire products and products in the retail business of tires group sector as well as the industrial business of the contitech group sector, except for the conveyor belt business, are not included in the calculation. - for the automotive and contitech group sectors, the calculation method is based on the expected product service life as stated by selected automotive manufacturers and the sold product weight, applying average-data methods with emission factors from icct and defra. - to calculate contitech group sector conveyor belt use phase emissions, an average belt weight, related idle power load, belt runtime per year and lifetime are assessed based on internal data and expert assessments. - the tires group sector calculation model is based on tire-industry aligned “product category rules” (pcr). the energy consumption of sold tires is calculated by considering rolling resistance and acceleration resistance. - furthermore, fuel-specific emission factors from defra, which are based on the pcr powertrain mix in the respective markets, are used for the tires group sector. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – end-of-life treatment of sold products - waste disposal and treatment of sold products at the end of their life cycle are considered. - the weight of the sold products is multiplied by the specific emission factors from sphera solutions gmbh in accordance with the disposal and recycling type. in the absence of weight information for individual product groups, emissions are calculated based on information on purchased goods. - internal expert assessments and industrial data are used in the classification of the disposal and recycling type. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – downstream leased assets - downstream leased assets are defined as the operation of assets owned by conti- nental that are leased to other companies during the reporting year, excluding those that are included in the scope 1 and scope 2 ghg emissions reported by the lessor. - this category is calculated using an average-data method. - the size of the leased assets is multiplied by the country- and asset-specific emission factors from pcaf (partnership for carbon accounting financials). - the leased equipment (e.g. machinery) are multiplied by a specific emission factor from defra. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – franchises - using an average-data method, the number of franchise locations is multiplied by the internally determined energy consumption and the specific emission factors from defra. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – investments - for this category, emissions are calculated using an average-data method. - the sales of at-equity-accounted investees in financial reporting are multiplied by the portion of continental’s financial contribution with own ghg emissions (calculated based on continental’s scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) per euro of sales. - in cases where sales figures are not available, ghg emissions are extrapolated based on the number of reporting companies."

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 137 transition plan for climate change mitigation continental’s partially formalized transition plan covers all relevant impacts, risks and opportunities and consists of a combination of ambitions, management approaches, targets, and key actions. continental’s management approach to scope 1 and scope 2 emis- sions, the corresponding target and the decarbonization roadmap 2040 form the basis for the transition plan for climate change miti- gation in own operations. furthermore, the management ap- proaches to scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition, are highly important for continental’s transition towards carbon neutrality. the key elements of the transition plan, such as the target (see sub- section targets related to climate change), the key actions (see sub- section key actions for target achievement) and the management approaches (see subsections management approaches to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency and renewable energy) have been approved by the executive board of the continental group. continental is of the opinion that the reduction target for scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions as one of the key ele- ments of the transition plan is in line with the paris agreement and a 1.5°c pathway (see subsection targets related to climate change). continental has no knowledge of being exempt from the eu paris- aligned benchmarks. to achieve the set ghg emission reduction target, continental has identified two primary decarbonization levers (see subsection tar- gets related to climate change), which are addressed by the de- fined actions (see subsection key actions for target achievement). furthermore, levers for scope 3 emissions are operationalized by the described management approaches. for a detailed description of the actions and associated metrics that provide information regarding the progress of the implementa- tion of the transition plan, see subsection key actions for target achievement. as part of the iro assessment (see subsection overview of mate- rial impacts, risks and opportunities in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section), continental analyzed the potential locked-in ghg emissions in the key assets. the conclusion from the analysis was that, due to their insignificance, they do not jeopardize the achieve- ment of the defined ghg emissions reduction target and do not foster any transition risks. the identified levers for achieving the emissions reduction target are applicable to all assets and are in line with the overarching ambition of achieving carbon neutrality in own operations by 2040. the sustainability strategy and decarbonization roadmap 2040 are integral parts of the overall business strategy and play a key role in transitioning to a more sustainable business model. when- ever implementation of the corresponding actions requires sub- stantial financial funding, it is reflected in the financial planning and budgeting processes accordingly. capex and opex for key actions 2024 total amount of capex and opex for key actions to implement the targets related to climate change, in € millions 50 definitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: - this metric only covers the key actions and no other elements of the transition plan. - the decarbonization roadmap 2040 covers scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions. - data is collected at the level of the key actions. capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure (opex) for key actions to implement targets related to climate change are included. currently, continental’s transition plan does not provide for a port- folio transition with the aim of meeting the criteria set out in the commission delegated regulation (eu) 2021/2139 regarding tax- onomy-aligned economic activities. in addition, continental is not reporting any taxonomy-aligned economic activities for 2024."

emissions for goods are calculated on a weight basis and for services on a cost basis. the emission factors of sphera solutions gmbh or internally determined group sector-specific and business area-specific ghg factors are used to calculate the emissions. - for purchased product groups for which not all weight data is available, the missing proportion is extrapolated using the average method. the expenditures for services are multiplied either by the specific emission factors from defra or by an internally determined emission factor. within this expenditure-based method, the data is extrapolated for a small share. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – capital goods - capital goods that are purchased in the reporting year are considered. - the expenditures for capital goods are multiplied either by the specific emission factors from defra or by an internally determined emission factor. as part of this expenditure-based method, the data for a small share is extrapolated. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – energy and fuel-related activities (not included in scopes 1 and 2) - energy- and fuel-related activities are defined as extraction, production, transportation, and transportation losses of purchased fuels and energy that are not covered by scope 1 or scope 2. - for energy consumption, the specific emission factors from defra are used within the framework of an average data method. - the country-specific power grid emission factors are calculated based on the defra calculation method. for this category, well-to-tank emission factors are considered. - an average transmission loss of 5 % as recommended by defra for steam and district heat is applied. - in the case of renewable electricity, it is assumed that the mix consists of 50 % photovoltaics and 50 % wind power. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – upstream transportation and distribution - upstream transportation and distribution are defined as the transportation of goods from direct suppliers to the company as well as within the company and to the customer, if paid for by the company and using third-party vehicles and facilities, including emissions from transportation services. - for this category, average data, costs and ghg data from service providers are applied using the distance-based method, with the missing share extrapolated. - apart from co2 data from service providers, the emissions for each mode of transport (road, rail, sea, and air) were determined through calculations, whereby a small proportion of the transport modes are estimated. - the basis for calculation includes logistics expenses, weight distance and transport equipment multiplied by the specific emission factors from sphera solutions gmbh or defra. - the emissions of the contitech group sector are primarily calculated based on the ghg data from service providers. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – waste generated in operations - waste generation is multiplied by specific emission factors from defra using an average data method for different waste categories, only considering emissions associated with landfill sites and incinerators. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – business travel - travel booking service providers report ghg emissions for business trips. hotel overnight stays are included as optional data. the various travel options are also considered and calculated. - some of these external primary data refer to emission factors from defra or vehicle manufacturers. - business travel that may not have been booked through these service providers is considered by an estimate based on an expert assumption. calculated indirect scope 3 ghg emissions – employee commuting - daily commuting time and modes of transport are based on an external global survey. - for this average-data method, the emissions are calculated on the basis of the estimated commuting distance, effective number of working days and the number of employees together with the defra emission factors."

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 135 key actions for target achievement continental has defined concrete key actions to achieve its scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions reduction target set for 2035 and to further foster the transition to carbon neutrality. corresponding decarbonization measures are embedded in the op- erational activities and are gradually being developed and imple- mented by the individual legal entities. the decentralized approach pursued leads to a large number of measures that are completed through specific projects with individual completion timelines rang- ing from short-term to long-term. continental’s climate change mitigation measures cover all types of activities in own operations. the decarbonization roadmap 2040 introduced in 2021 is the in- ternal set of rules for determining the key actions required to achieve the emissions reduction target. the decarbonization roadmap 2040 focuses on the most im- portant levers (see subsection targets related to climate change) which are further operationalized through concrete actions. continued purchase of green electricity continental purchases electricity solely from renewable energy sources. in doing so, continental makes use of green electricity con- tracts, power purchase agreements and other contractual instru- ments. for volumes of purchased electricity that are not covered by contractual instruments, continental purchases energy attribute cer- tificates that comply with the specified quality criteria. this key ac- tion is implemented by the respective legal entities in close coopera- tion with the central purchasing and environmental departments who ensure a holistic approach and full coverage of the externally purchased electricity volumes through corresponding instruments. technological transformation technological transformation takes place within the responsible le- gal entities supported by central functions (e.g. operations or infra- structure). as part of group sector-specific roadmap implementa- tion programs, suitable concrete measures for the respective loca- tions and production processes, as well as the sequence of their im- plementation at location level are analyzed and decided upon. at the tire plant in lousado, portugal, for example, an electric boiler was put into operation in 2024 to generate steam required for the production processes. gas, which was previously used as an energy source for steam generation, was replaced by green electricity. similar projects regarding the levers identified for target achieve- ment are implemented at various locations if this is technically and economically feasible. selection of the projects is part of the gen- eral investment process applying generally applicable criteria for decision-making as well as the allocation of capital. the investment budget is determined as part of financial planning. in the event of a positive investment decision, the necessary financial resources are thus made available for the project. the metrics for the achieved and expected ghg emissions reduc- tions as a result of the implementation of such projects are set out in the tables below. achieved ghg reduction 2024 scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg reduction achieved, in million tco2e 0.217 definitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: - the metric is calculated as the difference between the scope 1 and market-based scope 2 greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions from the base year of the decarbonization roadmap 2040 (2021) and the scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions at the end of the reporting year. - the data is collected by the individual locations. for certain locations, modeled calculations are used considering the number of employees and the type of operation. expected ghg reduction 2024 expected scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg reduction, in million tco2e 0.333 definitions, assumptions, and calculation methods: - the metric is calculated as difference between the scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions at the end of the reporting year and the target value for scope 1 and market-based scope 2 ghg emissions in 2035 (see subsection targets related to climate change). - the data is collected by the individual locations. for certain locations, modeled calculations are used considering the number of employees and the type of operation."

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 148 management approaches to pollution prevention the management approaches relevant for managing the iros re- garding pollution are related to environmental protection in own operations, environmental protection in the supply chain, product- related aspects regarding environmental protection, and sub- stances of concern and very high concern. environmental protection in own operations continental has introduced comprehensive environmental protec- tion measures and environmental management processes in own operations. these also include measures and processes to prevent or, if necessary, mitigate the identified potential negative impacts from possible releases into air, water and soil. as publicly stated in continental’s policy on environment, safety and health (environ- ment, safety and health policy, “esh policy”), we conserve re- sources and prevent pollution caused by emission into the air, wa- ter and soil. continental’s management approach for environmental protection measures covers own operations worldwide and is especially fo- cused on the production sites. responsibility for the implementation of environmental protection measures and pollution prevention lies with the management of continental's respective legal entities. the internal framework for environmental protection is defined by the environmental depart- ments of continental and supervised by the executive board and the group sector boards. the processes and monitoring regarding the prevention and con- tainment of environmental incidents are integrated into the overall environmental management system. the preventive measures are implemented on a site-specific basis and include, among others, emergency plans, site inspections by the local esh managers as well as regular maintenance plans. other measures are imple- mented where they are needed and include, for example, hazard- ous substance storage, excavation, separators, wastewater treat- ment and retention basins. the prevention and containment of environmental incidents or re- leases includes site-specific emergency plans that control and limit the impact on people and the environment in case of an actual re- lease. continental’s environmental management framework, including the prevention and containment of environmental incidents, consists of the public esh policy and the related environmental “responsible value chain commitments (rvc commitments)” as well as several internal rules at different levels of the organization. continental’s environmental management including the prevention and containment of environmental incidents, such as leakages, is based on the international environmental management standard iso 14001. coverage with certified environmental management systems can be found in the corresponding metric in this section. where relevant, local environmental management also includes a consultation with local stakeholders like authorities, employees or communities. continental's esh policy as well as the associated environment-re- lated rvc commitments are communicated externally on our web- site. in addition, training materials, other guidance documents and emergency response plans are available for company-internal com- munication purposes. environmental protection in the supply chain for environmental protection in the supply chain, continental has defined a management approach to prevent and reduce potential negative environmental impacts related to pollutant emissions to air, water and soil in the supply chain. as stated in our business partner code of conduct and rvc commitments, continental ex- pects its suppliers to maintain adequate environmental protection management procedures, including, but not limited to air quality, responsible chemical management, soil protection and the protec- tion of water bodies. continental’s management approach applies to all of the purchas- ing activities of continental and its subsidiaries worldwide. the fo- cus of the management approach is on the direct suppliers (includ- ing service providers), who in turn should pass on the requirements to their suppliers. additional specifics of the management approach apply to the natural rubber supply chain including the deeper sup- ply chain in relation to natural rubber sourcing. see also the man- agement approach to responsible sourcing and upstream value chains in the biodiversity and ecosystems (esrs e4) section. the management approach is primarily implemented by conti- nental’s purchasing departments, which are supported by the envi- ronmental and sustainability functions. this is overseen by the re- sponsible value chain due diligence system (rvcdds), including oversight by the executive board (see also the management ap- proach for workers in the value chain in the workers in the value chain (esrs s2) section). the rvcdds comprises a variety of processes covering strategy development and implementation, regulations management, man- agement of potential impacts and incident management (including complaints) as well as training. a multi-stage process comprising three lines has been set up to control and oversee system effi- ciency: in terms of the supply chain, the first line comprises the im- plementation of operational tasks at the level of the individual pur- chasing functions. the second line, represented by non-operational governance departments and roles, oversees the system, roles and responsibilities as well as their effectiveness. the third line is repre- sented by the internal audit function which performs an independ- ent evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the rvcdds."

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 148 management approaches to pollution prevention the management approaches relevant for managing the iros re- garding pollution are related to environmental protection in own operations, environmental protection in the supply chain, product- related aspects regarding environmental protection, and sub- stances of concern and very high concern. environmental protection in own operations continental has introduced comprehensive environmental protec- tion measures and environmental management processes in own operations. these also include measures and processes to prevent or, if necessary, mitigate the identified potential negative impacts from possible releases into air, water and soil. as publicly stated in continental’s policy on environment, safety and health (environ- ment, safety and health policy, “esh policy”), we conserve re- sources and prevent pollution caused by emission into the air, wa- ter and soil. continental’s management approach for environmental protection measures covers own operations worldwide and is especially fo- cused on the production sites.

rvcdds."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 149 the operational tasks include specific preventive and remedial measures regarding the supply chain, e.g. alignment of procure- ment strategies and practices, definition of contractual agreements and implementation of control mechanisms as well as training of purchasers and suppliers. selected suppliers are assessed on the basis of various criteria using self-assessment questionnaires ob- tained via the generally accepted sustainability platforms for our in- dustries, such as ecovadis and nqc. in addition, selective on-site audits or other audit activities are also carried out, for example in relation to the existence of environmental management systems. as part of an annual review process, the executive board of conti- nental ag is updated on the current status by continental’s human rights officer and assesses the system’s effectiveness, adequacy and potential for improvement. the rvcdds is additionally inte- grated into continental’s overarching internal control system, the risk management system and compliance management system. the expectations of suppliers with regard to appropriate environ- mental protection also include the prevention of incidents and emergency situations. the outlined processes are defined by an environment-related rvc commitment. further relevant rules of this internal framework in- clude dedicated rules for purchasing and the associated work in- structions, which guide the consistent application of the key pro- cesses in all of the company’s businesses and in supplier relations. direct suppliers are guided by the binding business partner code of conduct (bpcoc), which also refers to the rvc commitments. for suppliers of natural rubber, continental’s purchasing policy for sustainable natural rubber also applies. continental's management approach to environmental protection is guided by germany’s supply chain due diligence act (lieferket- tensorgfaltspflichtengesetz – lksg) as well as other due diligence standards such as the un guiding principles and the oecd guide- lines. the interests of stakeholders, such as customers and associations, are taken into account within the management processes. continental communicates its management approach through its public policy statement and externally published rvc commit- ments. supplier training initiatives are also carried out to further promote awareness and shared responsibility across the entire value chain. in addition, direct suppliers are requested to sign the business partner code of conduct. communication is therefore aimed at both stakeholders and suppliers. product-related aspects regarding environmental protection continental has anchored in its sustainability ambition to strive for emission-free mobility and industry together with its partners along the value chain by 2050 at the latest. in this context, “emission- free” means the complete mitigation of harmful emissions (such as greenhouse gases or nitrogen oxides (nox)). it does not include harmless emissions like water vapor emissions, non-toxic, biode- gradable particle emissions or minimal noise emissions. accordingly, continental has implemented a specific management approach to support the transition of our industries, reduce nega- tive environmental impacts in the product use phase, ensure regu- latory compliance and at the same time support opportunities for growth in specific business activities. with regard to tire and road wear particles and brake dust in partic- ular, continental is working on researching open issues relating to these non-tailpipe-related emissions and their generation, composi- tion, transport and fate in the environment. continental is helping to expand the base of scientifically sound knowledge about the im- pacts on human health and the environment, as the impacts have still not been sufficiently researched. it should therefore be noted that, according to current knowledge, tire and road wear will always occur in order to enable controllable and safe acceleration and braking as well as stable cornering. ef- forts are therefore being made to reduce wear particles from tires on the one hand, and to make them as environmentally friendly as possible on the other. the management approach focuses on products that contribute to the reduction of relevant emissions, in particular tailpipe emissions, tire and road wear particles and brake dust emissions. responsibility for expanding the business with zero-tailpipe-emis- sion vehicles (ztev) and for the implementation of measures to re- duce emissions, compliance with legal requirements and economic aspects lies with the respective business. they are supported by various central departments, including product development, sus- tainability, technical compliance and quality. oversight is ultimately provided by the group sector boards as well as the executive board of the continental group. the general processes of the management approach include, for example, market research, activities in the area of research and de- velopment, active portfolio management and close dialogue with customers – as also described in the climate change (esrs e1) sec- tion in the subsection on management approaches to climate change mitigation, climate change adaptation, energy efficiency and renewable energy under scope 3 emissions, portfolio resili- ence and transition. increasing business with ztev components and systems contributes to reducing tailpipe emissions in the use phase."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 150 the management processes regarding zero tailpipe emissions such as tire and road wear particles as well as brake dust comprise, in particular, r&d activities and cooperations in industry associations and with universities, science and customers in order to continue expanding the comprehensive understanding of the generation of tire and road wear particles as well as brake dust and their behavior in the environment. this includes also working on international standards for the measurement of particulate matter, e.g. within the frame of the unece. one example of a cooperation in the area of tire and road wear particles is the joint research project between continental, the university of southern denmark and the ecole normale supérieure de lyon to research the degradation of rubber polymers in the environment. furthermore, in r&d and product development processes (e.g. the product life cycle management), continental investigates and de- velops further technical developments and solutions designed to continuously reduce these emissions more and more, and to en- sure compliance with the increasingly stringent regulations. the product development processes also include working on the eco- nomic feasibility, market readiness and scaling of such solutions as well as the cooperation with customers, suppliers and other parties (e.g. universities). one example of basic research in the area of brake dust was the lowbrasys project, which was completed in 2019. the project assessed various technologies that could signifi- cantly reduce brake dust. with regard to tire and road wear particles, continental’s develop- ment engineers and material experts are working, in particular, on modifying both the tire design and the composition of tire com- pounds in order to reduce the impacts on the environment without compromising on the safety-related properties of the tires. the pro- cesses are similar for brake dust particles, with material and prod- uct development also involving cooperation with the suppliers of the relevant components such as brake pads and brake discs. the compliance of products with applicable standards, customer requirements and regulations is also subject to continental’s tech- nical compliance processes and quality management systems. advances in these processes can also help continental to generate competitive advantages in the medium term in a surrounding of changing product requirements, and to exploit growth and margin opportunities, particularly for components and systems for zero- tailpipe-emission vehicles and for tires and braking systems. as a result of the iros, specific processes for incidents and emer- gency situations in the downstream value chain are not relevant. the management approaches are guided by continental’s tech- nical compliance framework and the sustainability ambition. fur- ther internal rules on specific business processes apply. current and upcoming international technical standards, obliga- tions and regulations regarding pollution (e.g. euro 7) are relevant and binding for continental’s products and measurements (such as the un global technical regulation no. 24 for brake emissions). to ensure compliant products and to reduce pollution, continental maintains active dialogue with stakeholders such as authorities, customers, science and industry associations, as well as industry associations and initiatives (such as the european association of automotive suppliers (clepa), the european tyre & rubber manu- facturers association (etrma), and the u.s. tire manufacturers as- sociation (ustma)). of particular note is the cooperation between tire manufacturers and the world business council for sustainable development (wbcsd) on the subject of tire abrasion as part of the “tire industry project” (tip). one important element of the communication on topics regarding non-tailpipe-related emissions in the use phase is the joint commu- nication via industry projects (e.g. tip) or associations. substances of concern and very high concern continental has implemented a management approach for sub- stances of concern and very high concern to ensure the safe usage of these chemicals, protect employees and environment and be compliant with regulations, and to gradually substitute them with more sustainable chemicals. as outlined in continental’s sustainability ambition for “clean and safe factories” and in our esh policy, preventive measures are taken, hazards are eliminated and risks are reduced. our framework to substitute and minimize the use of substances of concern in own operations specifies that hazardous chemicals should be evaluated if a less hazardous alternative or substitute is available. the management approach regarding substances of concern in the supply chain is largely covered by the management approach for environmental protection in the supply chain. our business partner code of conduct also includes the expectation that our business partners will manage all chemicals responsibly. continental’s hazardous substances management covers own op- erations worldwide and is especially focused on production sites. it also partially encompasses aspects in the upstream and down- stream value chain. the management approach covers both sub- stances of concern and substances of very high concern."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 155 further information on the iro assessment in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems continental has no locations in own operations that have a signifi- cant impact on biodiversity and ecosystems. continental has no material negative impacts with regards to land degradation, desertification or soil sealing. continental has no locations in the vicinity of habitats of endan- gered species that have significant negative impacts on them. management approaches to biodiversity and ecosystems continental has implemented management approaches that ad- dress the impacts, risks, dependencies and opportunities related to biodiversity and ecosystems. the management approaches explicitly address the issue of defor- estation in the upstream value chain. the management approaches do not address sustainable practices in connection with the oceans or seas, as no associated material impacts, risks, dependencies or opportunities have been identified. responsible purchasing and upstream value chain continental’s management approach for responsible purchasing and upstream value chain addresses two material drivers of biodi- versity loss in the supply chain: pollution and deforestation. for the pollution driver, continental has implemented a manage- ment approach to avoid and reduce potential negative environ- mental impacts related to the generation of pollutants in air, water and soil in the supply chain. this management approach is de- scribed in the subsection environmental protection in the supply chain in the pollution (esrs e2) section. in addition, continental has implemented a management approach to prevent the loss of biodiversity through deforestation, particu- larly through the cultivation of natural rubber, and to comply with the regulatory requirements for deforestation-free supply chains. as part of responsible purchasing, continental indirectly addresses the driver of biodiversity loss, in particular change in land use in connection with deforestation. in addition, the management approach addresses continental’s dependence on natural rubber. in 2018, continental introduced a “sustainable natural rubber sourcing policy” to ensure responsible purchasing. the purchasing policy has been integrated into the business processes and decision-making processes, risk manage- ment and processes for risk mitigation. by implementing this man- agement approach, continental is able to increase the resilience of the supply chain while addressing the risks associated with the eu deforestation regulation (eudr) and subsequent market changes. the social consequences of the impacts on biodiversity associated with deforestation are given special consideration in the manage- ment approach. sustainable or agricultural practices are addressed in the sustaina- ble natural rubber sourcing policy. continental’s management approach for responsible purchasing fo- cuses on direct suppliers and indirectly on the deeper supply chain. continental expects its direct suppliers to cascade the principles through their respective supply chains. regarding sustainable natu- ral rubber, the management approach explicitly covers the supply chain down to the rubber plantation. responsibility for the management approach to environmental pro- tection is described in the corresponding subsection in the pollu- tion (esrs e2) section under environmental protection in the sup- ply chain. responsibility for the implementation of the manage- ment approach regarding the responsible purchasing of natural rubber lies with the respective purchasing departments, which are supported e.g. by the sustainability departments. strategic monitor- ing is the responsibility of the group sector boards and, at an over- arching level, the executive board of the continental group."

(see esrs 2, iro table, risk 31) › continental buys numerous products and services from a global supplier base. therefore, continental’s direct and indirect suppli- ers operate in certain markets and industries that pose a risk of potential deforestation, particularly in relation to natural rubber. if corrective measures are not taken and due diligence measures are not performed or serious violations occur, continental can be exposed to sanction regulations with substantial penalties and fines or even business on hold for the respective business opera- tion, especially in the medium term. (see esrs 2, iro table, risk 30) › continental operates in certain markets and industries and pro- cures numerous products and services from a global supplier base which must comply with increasing regulatory requirements with regard to biodiversity. comprehensive preventive measures for securing access to supply chains that are prepared for fast in- creasing regulation on biodiversity due diligence might poten- tially create comparatively more resilient supply chains offering significant potential for differentiation from the competition in the medium term. (see esrs 2, iro table, opportunity 32) downstream value chain › continental provides components and systems for vehicles and industrial applications. in the use phase of vehicles and industrial applications as well as in the provision of the related infrastruc- tures (e.g. roads and mines), significant direct and indirect nega- tive impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems (particularly climate change, pollution and changes in land use) occur. these are pri- marily indirectly related to the individual companies in the vehicle and industrial value chains.

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 157 due to the nature of continental’s products, the driver change in the land use (e.g. road infrastructure) in the downstream value chain is considered out of continental’s scope of influence. there- fore, no specific management approach was defined for the driver change in the land use. continental’s management approaches relate to the following di- rect drivers of biodiversity loss listed in esrs e4, ar4: › climate change, › pollution. continental has not identified any material risks related to biodiver- sity and ecosystems in the downstream value chain. biodiversity and ecosystems-related social consequences in the downstream value chain are not considered separately in the man- agement approaches. along the downstream value chain, the traceability of products and thus the product-related impacts are extremely limited due to the nature of the products and are therefore not taken into account in the management approaches. targets related to biodiversity and ecosystems continental has defined a systematic process for setting targets. with regard to biodiversity and ecosystems, it was decided to pur- sue the defined management approaches and not to set a time- bound sustainability target. the monitoring of effectiveness and the tracking of progress is described in the related management ap- proaches and reported metrics. key actions for target achievement in continental’s view, key actions to be reported relate directly to corresponding targets, where available. therefore, in accordance with this definition, continental has not defined any key actions in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems beyond the described man- agement approaches."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 158 consideration of biodiversity and ecosystems in the strategy and business model relation to strategy and business model the impacts and risks identified in relation to biodiversity and eco- systems are by definition related to continental’s strategy and busi- ness model. integration into continental’s strategy and business model is described in this section in the management approaches responsible purchasing and upstream value chain as well as down- stream value chain. in addition, the analysis of the resilience of continental’s strategy and business model in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems along the entire value chain is integrated into the general iro as- sessment (see subsection overview of material impacts, risks and opportunities in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section). resilience of strategy and business model the focus of the resilience analysis is on the combined transition and systemic risk related to deforestation regulation and has been incorporated into the general iro assessment. in the process of identifying and assessing risks and opportunities as part of the general iro assessment, continental took into con- sideration several factors and scenarios, as described in the iros. the use of scenarios and assumptions by definition leads to uncer- tainties in the outcome of the analysis. to assess the resilience of continental’s business model to the identified risks and opportunities, a net assessment was carried out taking into account the existing management approaches related to biodiversity and ecosystems. based on the identified risks, the upstream value chain represents the focus of the resilience analysis. the key assumptions of the identified risks were the assumed de- velopment of regulation and market developments, as described in the respective risks. this includes especially the expected imple- mentation of the eudr. the stakeholders were involved in the assessment as described in the general methodology of the iro assessment in the subsection overview of material impacts, risks and opportunities presented in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section. continental has assessed its material risks in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems and especially in relation to deforestation, with a focus on a medium-term time horizon. based on the iro assessment and taking into account the manage- ment approaches, continental considers its business activities to be resilient. the management approaches in relation to biodiversity and ecosystems describe continental’s current ability to reduce its material negative impacts, manage risks and seize opportunities. continental also assumes that these skills will continue to develop over time."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 160 management approaches for resource use and circular economy in the area of resource use and circular economy, continental has developed the management approaches circularity and waste in own operations in order to manage the described impacts, risks and opportunities. circularity our management approach for circularity aims to contribute to continental’s sustainability ambition and achieve 100 % closed re- source and product loops by 2050 at the latest. besides fulfilling this ambition, this management approach strives to mitigate re- lated risks in the area of circularity considering the different require- ments and speeds of transformation of our customers, industries and markets. the management approach encompasses the upstream and down- stream value chain as well as continental’s own operations and also includes switching from the use of primary to secondary resources and materials. the procurement of renewable and recycled (secondary) materials is a key element here. the management approach applies to the entire group and the product portfolio and covers resource inflows and outflows. the responsible business functions bear the responsibility for the management and adaptation of the respective product portfolio. oversight of the effectiveness of portfolio management is exercised by the group sector boards and the executive board of continental. key processes are handled by the respective departments within the company, e.g. research and development (r&d), product de- sign, supply chain management and purchasing. these are sup- ported by the sustainability departments. the management approach includes specific process regarding re- source inflows and outflows considering technological, biological and product cycles. for resource inflows, the related key measures regarding purchased resources are mainly managed in purchasing, product design and r&d processes. the process of material approval, managed by r&d, serves among other purposes the identification of recycled and renewable materi- als to be introduced in production processes. the process of mate- rial approval usually consists of a laboratory evaluation, followed by testing and a processing evaluation before a material is released. the sourcing of renewable and recycled materials partially includes active supplier development, which is managed by the purchasing departments, as well as the sourcing of materials within traceability mechanisms like the mass balance approach. in addition, continental engages with selected suppliers in strategic supplier meetings to intensify activities regarding circularity such as through respective adaptation in product design and material composition. for resource outflows, the management approach comprises measures with regard to the circularity of products that are mainly managed within product design as well as r&d processes, with a focus on improved reusability, repairability, recyclability, durability and overall circularity. this includes own activities as well as indus- try cooperations and partnerships. continental’s sustainability ambition sets the overarching frame- work for the definition and implementation of measures. for the traceability of dedicated materials, continental applies the iscc plus framework as described in more detail in the following subsections of this section. the management approach and the related measures take into consideration in particular the requirements of customers and re- quests of investors. for resource inflows, especially direct suppliers as part of the upstream value chain are directly involved. for re- source outflows, the perspectives of stakeholders relevant to end- of-life treatment are also taken into account, for example in industry initiatives. continental communicates its approach to managing circularity ex- ternally through the publication of the annual report as well as trade fairs, press releases and dialogues with investors, and inter- nally using various channels such as conferences on sustainability and products, working groups and the company-wide intranet. waste in own operations to minimize the negative impact of landfilling or incineration of non-recyclable waste from own operations and to make the best possible use of opportunities in relation to waste efficiency, conti- nental has developed a management approach for waste that is in- tegrated into the general environmental management. a defined waste hierarchy has been introduced at the locations for this pur- pose. it prioritizes actions to reduce waste generation, followed by reusing materials, recycling, and recovering energy from waste. the least preferred option is disposal, such as landfill. by following this hierarchy, we can reduce environmental impact and promote sus- tainable use of resources. continental strives to gradually reduce the amount of waste and the generation of waste at its locations step by step and year by year. due to the different business activi- ties within the company, specific programs are designed by the in- dividual group sectors in line with respective needs."
"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 161 the management approach for waste in own operations covers the entire continental group. continental’s environmental strategy is steered and approved by the executive board. the associated programs are coordinated in internal committees of the environmental protection departments. the waste management is embedded in continental's environmen- tal management systems. waste-related processes are monitored and continuously improved as part of the general reviews of environmental management. continental’s environmental management system was developed in accordance with iso 14001, an internationally recognized standard for environmental management systems from the international or- ganization for standardization (iso). the management approach reflects the interests of various stake- holders by using the widely accepted waste hierarchy and the adher- ence to iso 14001. the direct interaction with stakeholders in rela- tion to waste takes place in particular with the responsible authorities. continental communicates its management approach to waste management through various channels to ensure comprehensive understanding and engagement across the entire company. this includes information on the intranet, which makes the approach and specific internal rules accessible to all employees. targets related to resource use and circular economy as part of its sustainability ambition in relation to circularity and carbon neutrality, continental has set a public sustainability target for the tires group sector with regard to recycled and renewable material inflows. continental has set for itself the target of increas- ing the share of recycled and renewable production materials for tires to at least 40 % by 2030. the target is related to continental’s management approaches cir- cularity as noted in this section, and scope 3 emissions, portfolio resilience and transition in the climate change (esrs e1) section of this sustainability report. the processes of the management ap- proach to circularity in terms of resource inflows are decisive for achieving the defined target. these are focused on resource inflow and enable this target to be achieved, as increased share of recy- cled and renewable materials is expected to lead to a lower carbon footprint for materials while at the same time enabling closed-loop resource cycles. continental has identified key levers regarding resource inflows to increase the share of recycled and renewable tire production mate- rials. these comprise measures on the selection of recycled and re- newable materials, which are usually managed by r&d, as well as the identification of new suppliers and the further development of existing suppliers to secure relevant quantities of recycled and re- newable materials in the purchasing processes. these are set out in specific material roadmaps and are regularly updated. correspond- ing certifications of origin or other instruments for origin and trace- ability contribute towards achieving the target by making it possi- ble to create transparency in the supply chains. transitioning away from non-renewable resources will be achieved by replacing non-renewable materials with alternatives from renew- able sources. in addition, the replacement of primary materials with materials from secondary sources, e.g. from recycling processes, contribute towards achieving the target. for selecting renewable and recycled materials, the technical ability to integrate these with- out compromising safety and performance into our tires is prereq- uisite. this is ensured in the general process of material approval by r&d through detailed assessments and tests that take into ac- count the material characteristics, their interdependencies in the overall material composition and the tires as the end product. in general, some materials can be replaced by technically identical al- ternatives without changing the material composition or the end product, e.g. when a primary material is replaced by the same but recycled material. in addition, in some cases, replacing materials with alternative and technically slightly different yet renewable or recycled materials can lead to smaller differences in the end prod- uct. in doing so, continental always ensures the same level of prod- uct safety and performance as well as takes further relevant bound- ary conditions into account. based on the materials identified and approved as recycled or re- newable resource inflow, a joint strategy development process takes place between purchasing, r&d and sustainability. for materi- als identified with a potential to contribute to the target in a signifi- cant manner, dedicated material roadmaps are developed and maintained by the purchasing departments. these roadmaps as- sess the general availability of the respective materials for the re- quired quantities and allow conclusive analysis on their availability"

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 159 material impacts, risks and opportunities related to resource use and circular economy continental assessed its potential and actual negative and positive impacts as well as risks and opportunities related to sustainability according to the regulatory requirements and as described in the general disclosures (esrs 2) section. the general disclosures in- clude an overview of the assessment of all identified impacts, risks and opportunities (iros), including the time horizons considered. in this iro assessment, the following material potential and actual negative impacts, risks and opportunities have been identified in re- lation to resource use and circular economy. they have been grouped together into iro clusters for easier understanding and reading. the descriptions of the negative impacts and risks are pre- sented from a gross perspective which, on the basis of applied methodology, does not take into account mitigation through the management approaches of continental as described in the re- spective iro cluster. this perspective is used to determine where appropriate management approaches are relevant and correspond- ing reporting is required. as opportunities are strengthened by continental’s management approaches, their descriptions are pre- sented taking a net perspective which, for methodical reasons, con- siders the results of the management approaches. the descriptions of the iros are to be regarded as self-contained, which may result in repetitions. circularity › continental buys numerous products and services from a global supplier base. continental and its direct suppliers and indirect suppliers along the supply chain also operate in industries and types of operations which involve significant sourcing of raw ma- terials from primary or non-renewable sources (including fossil- based materials and materials from mining). (see esrs 2, iro ta- ble, impact 33) › continental buys numerous products and services from a global supplier base. therefore, continental’s direct and indirect suppli- ers also operate in industries and specific markets which could be subject to regulation related to the use of non-renewable respec- tively renewable and non-recycled respectively recycled re- sources as well as the related market transition. this can lead to significantly higher costs for materials, components or services especially in the medium term, if not managed preventively. (see esrs 2, iro table, risk 36) › continental operates in industries which are not yet fully circular. the global product and material cycles for electronic compo- nents, tires, industrial components and other products are only partially closed. considering the total amount of material in conti- nental’s products, the related end-of-life-disposal of continental’s products therefore contributes substantively to waste generation. (see esrs 2, iro table, impact 34) › continental’s product portfolio serves markets which are trans- forming considerably because of circularity-related regulatory re- quirements and market trends. related regulatory requirements such as climate protection regulations can also be important for circularity. given the broadness of continental’s portfolio, many product segments and the business with many customer groups could face transformational challenges and the speed of change could exceed the potential speed of adaptation. this could, if not managed adequately, lead to a critical loss in sales in the respec- tive business activities, especially in the long term. (see esrs 2, iro table, risk 37) waste in own operations › continental currently generates non-recyclable waste (including hazardous waste) in own operations, which is sent to landfill or in- cineration plants. this leads to limited negative impacts on circu- lar economy and is therefore considered relevant for corporate responsibility. (see esrs 2, iro table, impact 35) › continental’s waste management could open up moderate finan- cial opportunities by reducing operational costs, if waste manage- ment and waste handling are further improved in the medium term. this opportunity is considered relevant from an esrs re- porting perspective.

"continental ag 2024 annual report management report sustainability report – environmental information 163 key actions for target achievement continental has introduced concrete key actions to achieve the tar- get of at least 40 % recycled and renewable materials share in tire production by 2030. these actions mainly relate to the key levers of material identification, strategies for securing sufficient supplies and traceability, e.g. via the mass balance approach. overall, actions related to the target are also strongly connected with the overall management approach of circularity. in order to be able to react flexibly to the changing market situation and changing needs, the actions are further developed step by step. the identification of renewable and recycled materials is one deci- sive factor to reach the target. thus, the research and development department is continuously monitoring alternative materials to re- place non-renewable sources with renewable sources and primary sources with secondary sources. innovative approaches are pur- sued as the usage of plant-based materials instead of fossil-based fillers, oils and resins. the activities aimed at increasing the share of recycled or renewable materials are inherently embedded into the operational processes of r&d. thus, there is one overall process for material identification including material approval that is identical for recycled and renewable materials as well as non-recycled and non-renewable materials. as the availability of certain materials is crucial, there is a defined set of renewable and recycled materials suitable to enable reaching the target. these materials are identified by internal experts from r&d, sustainability and purchasing. this serves as a foundation to develop corresponding material roadmaps and purchasing strate- gies which are continuously monitored and updated. materials that contribute towards increasing the share of recycled and renewable production materials in the initial steps are, in particular, recovered carbon black and recycled polyester. on the basis of the identified materials that contribute towards achieving the target of a minimum of 40 % recycled and renewable materials for tire production, purchasing strategies including mate- rial roadmaps are created with the involvement of experts from purchasing, r&d and sustainability. the creation and review of these roadmaps defines the overall framework of measures for the long-term procurement of the respective materials with implemen- tation scenarios. in addition, concrete short-term actions are devel- oped on this basis as flexible elements such as material-specific procurement activities in order to react to changing market situa- tions. these plans are coordinated and agreed with the board of the tires group sector, and regularly reviewed and adapted as needed. while the integration of selected materials requires only limited adaptation in production processes, their availability in terms of large volumes at economically compatible cost is a deci- sive factor. in any case, continental guarantees the same uniform level of safety and performance of all our tires. whenever possible, continental strives to secure volumes of relevant materials in the long term. for the tires group sector, natural rubber is a key raw material that also contributes towards the share of renewable and recycled pro- duction materials. therefore, with our partnerships along the value chain and the corresponding purchasing strategies, continental will continue to source natural rubber and secure sufficient quantities for the coming years. as concrete examples of actions that contrib- ute towards achieving the target, continental invests in processes for obtaining high-quality recycled materials for example through the strategic partnership with pyrum to implement a circular ap- proach to recycling of old tires. using a special pyrolysis process, carbon black, oil and gas are recovered as secondary resources and used for the production of new tires, among other purposes. similarly, with its contire.tex solution, continental has invented to- gether with the partner otiz a process for high-performance yarn that allows conventional polyester to be replaced with polyester made from recycled pet-bottles. first products with recycled pet bottles are already introduced and a global rollout of this material in all continental tire plants is foreseen within the year 2025. the creation of transparency and reliable information on recycled and renewable materials through the various steps in our complex value chains is a key action for continental. over the last few years, mass balance approaches prevailed as standard especially in chem- ical industry, allowing the regulated and transparent accounting of the quantities and the respective characteristics of recycled and re- newable materials. we see mass balance approaches as a neces- sary tool for the transition away from fossil resources in our mate- rial value chains. it reduces complexity, speeds up the adoption of materials and ensures continuous supply. if materials certified as
