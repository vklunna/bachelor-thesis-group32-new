"E5 RESOURCE USE AND CIRCULAR ECONOMY MATERIAL IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES SBM-3 Packaging gets our beer safely to consumers and influences what they buy. But it is also responsible for more than half of our value chain carbon emissions, and cutting its climate impact is a priority to achieve our ZERO Carbon Footprint ambition. Meanwhile, awareness about the environmental impact of packaging continues to grow and reducing this impact is high on the agenda for legislators. Our DMA identified three material negative impacts in our value chain that relate to resource use and the circular economy. It also identified one material financial opportunity that the circular economy presents for our business in the medium term. This section details these IROs further, as well as the policies, targets and actions in place to mitigate the risks and capitalise on the opportunity. How our E5 Resource use and circular economy IROs link to our value chain AGRICULTURE PACKAGING BEVERAGE PRODUCTION & ADMINISTRATION DISTRIBUTION SELLING & MARKETING REUSE & RECYCLING IRO-1 We have several processes to screen our products’ environmental footprints. To assess the sustainability aspects of innovation projects, we use a sustainability scorecard. This evaluates the product and process innovation contribution to the environmental footprint of raw materials, the brewing process, primary and secondary packaging, transportation, recyclability and consumer appeal. In addition, we provide a life cycle assessment tool to our markets for more in-depth evaluation of the environmental footprint of our products. This tool uses the industry-standardised method codeveloped by the Carlsberg Group, known as the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) for beer. We assess the recyclability of our packaging by considering the material composition (for PET) and colour (for PET and glass), and monitor the development of recycling rates in our markets and support initiatives to increase them through, for example, deposit return scheme developments. As part of our DMA process, we performed interviews with internal and external stakeholders and conducted third-party research in relation to resource use and circular economy.

"E5-1 Policies Through our ZERO Packaging Waste focus area of TTZAB, we are working to source more reusable, recycled or recyclable packaging and driving progress towards circularity. Underpinning this work is our Environmental Policy, which details our requirements for reducing the impact of our packaging, as well as minimising all waste and utilising by-products. It also commits us to using life cycle assessments (LCAs) or similar environmental assessments for all new packaging types, and to working with partners to reduce consumption of packaging materials while promoting a more circular approach. The policy addresses sustainable sourcing and the use of renewable materials, from both packaging and raw material perspectives. Details of the policy are summarised in E1-2 on page 66. E5-3; E5-2 Targets and actions ZERO Packaging Waste We aim to use less virgin fossil-based plastic and more renewable, recycled or recyclable materials in our packaging. We also strive to increase the amount of packaging that is collected and reused or recycled after use. In these ways, we increase full circularity of our packaging. Our targets, outlined below, commit us to playing an active role in minimising the environmental impact of beverage packaging systems, as set out in our Environmental Policy. While our targets are not based on mandatory requirements, legislation related to these areas is evolving and we are working to ensure alignment. In our target setting, we have been inspired by definitions from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the scientific resources it makes available on the circular economy. Our first three targets relate to recycling and reuse, while our fourth target relates to reduction of waste. For information on how TTZAB targets are based on the views of our stakeholders, see E1-4 Climate change targets on page 55. We have not changed the targets in 2024. However, the processes adopted to collect data have evolved to become more detailed and robust, allowing us to establish the baseline for this target. Our understanding of our performance and what is required to meet the targets has also improved. Our ongoing actions related to resource use and circular economy aim to make a significant contribution to our GHG emissions reductions globally. They include internal projects and innovations across all markets, global collaboration with suppliers, industry engagement, and advocacy to support the roll-out of effective deposit return schemes. To learn more about our methodology for these targets, and for additional details, please see the corresponding accounting policies below. Target 1: 100% recyclable, reusable or renewable packaging by 2030 We aim for all our packaging to be 100% recyclable, reusable or renewable by 2030. The scope of the target includes all primary packaging that is in direct contact with our products, i.e. bottles (glass and plastic), cans and plastic kegs. Our actions in this area are focused on increasing our use of recyclable, reusable or renewable packaging to minimise our environmental impact. In 2024, we continued to undertake analysis of our primary packaging. Through improving our data collection, we have increased our understanding of our performance and developed a roadmap of specific actions to achieve our ambitions. This will enable us to measure and report on our performance and identify challenges and opportunities to achieve our policy commitment of reducing consumption of packaging materials and promoting their reuse and recycling. We have developed a clear roadmap of actions to drive progress and are now expanding our focus from primary packaging to secondary packaging as well. In 2024, 94% of our packaging was recyclable, renewable or reusable. This is also the baseline year for this target, and this performance is in line with our expectations. Please see the Performance on targets 1-3 table on page 86 for a breakdown by material type. Target 2: 90% collection and recycling rate for bottles and cans by 2030 We are targeting a 90% collection and recycling rate for bottles (glass and plastic), cans and kegs (plastic and steel) by 2030. We measure progress by comparing hectolitres of beer sold in each market with the recycling rate for each packaging type in that market. To read about our actions to address this target, see the section “Addressing our financial opportunity: initiating deposit return and recycling schemes” on page 86. In 2024, our markets globally achieved an average collection and recycling rate of 76%, representing an increase of 4 percentage points from our 2019 baseline of 72%. Matching our expectations, this performance reflects major positive developments in deposit return schemes and industry partnerships. Please see the Performance on targets 1-3 table on page 86 for a breakdown by material type. Target 3: 50% recycled content in bottles and cans by 2030 We aim to reach 50% recycled content in our bottles (glass and plastic), cans and plastic kegs by 2030. Recycled content must come from post-consumer recycled material, as defined by the ISO 14021 standard. In 2024, 43% of the material content of our primary packaging comprised recycled materials, representing an increase of 14 percentage points from our 2019 baseline of 29%. This performance is in line with our expectations and reflects our commitment to create circular value chains.

"Addressing our financial opportunity: initiating deposit return and recycling schemes (E5-2) By promoting industry-driven non-profit deposit return schemes (DRSs), we can create a higher level of resilience in our packaging value chain. High return rates can reduce the risk of environmental fees on our packaging and maintain the high value of clean mono-materials in a closed recycling loop for beer and beverage packaging. This creation of circular material flows also contributes to a future-proofed business model in a world with increasing material scarcity. As our DMA indicated, recycling and DRSs represent a material financial opportunity for our business. As they are also a key lever for reaching our ZERO Packaging Waste goals, facilitating their creation and development in markets around the world is one of our priorities. We have, for many years, been active in developing recycling and DRSs in many of our markets, with significant improvements in return rates for bottles and cans achieved in all four Nordic and all three Baltic countries. We are exploring expanding these efforts in regions with low recycling rates, such as Asia and Central & Eastern Europe, and supporting the continued implementation across Western Europe. In 2024, we finalised a position paper advocating for DRSs as the optimal separate collection system for beverage packaging, based on research and experience across our markets. We also hosted a workshop in Latvia for our European markets and local representatives from the DRS scheme in Latvia to exchange best practice and tools for implementation. Improving existing DRSs and supporting the roll-out of effective DRSs in more markets will increase our collection rate, helping us to reach our 2030 target and meet our policy commitment to play an active role in improving and building beverage packaging systems with less environmental impact.

Target 4: 50% reduction in virgin fossil-based plastic by 2030 We aim to reduce our use of virgin fossil-based plastic by 50% by 2030 compared with 2019. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of plastic needed through lightweighting, or by replacing virgin fossil-based plastic with recycled content or renewable materials, such as recycled PET or PEF. We are taking action to increase the recycled content in our bottles and reduce the virgin fossil-based plastic in our packaging. This will reduce the negative impact of the significant volume of packaging materials we use. We continue to partner with local suppliers to explore ways to increase recycled content in plastic bottles on a market-by-market level, for example achieving 80% recycled content across our PET portfolio in Norway. These actions address targets 3 and 4. Our actions and innovations are minimising the need for virgin materials and contributing to our policy objectives of reducing consumption of packaging materials and promoting their reuse and recycling. We also achieve this commitment by lightweighting and by replacing virgin materials with recycled content or renewable materials, such as recycled PET. In 2024, we used 48 kt of virgin plastic in our primary packaging materials, representing a decrease of 20% from our 2019 baseline of 60 kt. This performance is driven, in particular, by increasing the use of recycled materials and it is in line with our expectations.

"ACCOUNTING POLICIES Rate of recyclable, reusable or renewable packaging is calculated as the volume of beverages sold in recyclable, reusable or renewable primary packaging materials (excl. steel kegs) divided by the total volumes sold. Reusable: the material must be designed to be used more than twice in the same application. Renewable: the material must be made of biomass that can be continually replenished, and any biomass used for packaging solutions should comply with the sustainability requirements of the EU regulatory framework. Recyclable: see accounting policy on ""share of recyclable content in packaging"" in E5-5 for definition. The recycling rate is the average recycling and collection rate for primary packaging (excl. steel kegs), weighted based on production volume. Where reusable glass bottles are lost in the market, we assume the standard recycling rate for the country, as used for one-way glass bottles. The rate of recycled content is the average share of recycled content in primary packaging (excl. steel kegs), weighted across different packaging types using the beverage production volume they carry. See accounting policy on ""weight of recycled or reused materials"" in E5-4 for definition. Virgin plastic use is calculated as the weight of virgin plastic purchased. This covers plastic materials used in primary, secondary and tertiary packaging. Virgin plastics are defined as those not purchased as recycled or reused materials (see accounting policy on “weight of recycled or reused materials” in E5-4 for definition). Packaging mix includes the share of total production volume of beer and soft drinks packed in primary packaging types, calculated as the volume (hl) of beverage produced in a packaging type divided by total production volume. A higher degree of measurement uncertainty is present in the input data for the above-mentioned metrics. For more details, see Appendix 3 (BP-2) on pages 108-109. Current and future allocated resources For the purchasing of recycled packaging materials, primarily recycled PET, we invested DKK 120m in OpEx in 2024. In 2025, the investment is expected to be within the range of DKK 130-170m in OpEx. This includes investments in rPET. The costs of purchasing cardboard or solid board with recycled materials as well as reusable glass bottles are not captured here due to the practice being a mainstream and thoroughly integrated part of our packaging procurement processes already. These costs are not specifically segmented in our accounting and are reported based on the general rules for financial reporting.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Total weight of products and biological materials includes agricultural ingredients (adjuncts: e.g. barley and rice; other ingredients: e.g. hops and sugar; process materials: e.g. brewing additives and yeast) and packaging materials (primary: aluminium, glass and plastic; secondary and tertiary: e.g. corrugated and hi-cone). The inflow is directly measured through procurement reports and includes all material inflow related to the production of beverages. We apply a consistent cut-off period and a standardised classification system across all regions. Total weight of recycled or reused materials is defined as materials that have been reprocessed or recovered after post-consumer usage with the consumer being either a downstream customer (industry) or end-consumer. The inflow of recycled content includes primary, secondary and tertiary packaging materials. The share of reused or recycled content is calculated as the weight of recycled and reused materials divided by the total material inflow. Biological materials that are sustainably sourced is calculated as the weight of sustainably sourced biological materials divided by the total inflow of biological materials. The total inflow of biological materials includes raw materials (including barley, sugar, syrup and wheat) and biological packaging materials (including cardboard). For the definition of sustainably sourced materials, please see the accounting policy for share of raw materials that are sustainably sourced on page 83. Share of recyclable content in packaging is calculated as the weight of recyclable packaging materials divided by the total weight of packaging materials (primary, secondary and tertiary). To be considered recyclable, the specific packaging material must be technically designed to fit into a recycling stream that has been proven to work in practice and at scale in a representative market. The methodology follows the principles of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's (EMF) global approach. To assess the technical recyclability of PET materials, a component-specific assessment is conducted on the colour and barrier of the product.

"E5-1 Policies Through our ZERO Packaging Waste focus area of TTZAB, we are working to source more reusable, recycled or recyclable packaging and driving progress towards circularity. Underpinning this work is our Environmental Policy, which details our requirements for reducing the impact of our packaging, as well as minimising all waste and utilising by-products. It also commits us to using life cycle assessments (LCAs) or similar environmental assessments for all new packaging types, and to working with partners to reduce consumption of packaging materials while promoting a more circular approach. The policy addresses sustainable sourcing and the use of renewable materials, from both packaging and raw material perspectives. Details of the policy are summarised in E1-2 on page 66. E5-3; E5-2 Targets and actions ZERO Packaging Waste We aim to use less virgin fossil-based plastic and more renewable, recycled or recyclable materials in our packaging. We also strive to increase the amount of packaging that is collected and reused or recycled after use. In these ways, we increase full circularity of our packaging. Our targets, outlined below, commit us to playing an active role in minimising the environmental impact of beverage packaging systems, as set out in our Environmental Policy. While our targets are not based on mandatory requirements, legislation related to these areas is evolving and we are working to ensure alignment. In our target setting, we have been inspired by definitions from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the scientific resources it makes available on the circular economy. Our first three targets relate to recycling and reuse, while our fourth target relates to reduction of waste. For information on how TTZAB targets are based on the views of our stakeholders, see E1-4 Climate change targets on page 55. We have not changed the targets in 2024. However, the processes adopted to collect data have evolved to become more detailed and robust, allowing us to establish the baseline for this target. Our understanding of our performance and what is required to meet the targets has also improved. Our ongoing actions related to resource use and circular economy aim to make a significant contribution to our GHG emissions reductions globally. They include internal projects and innovations across all markets, global collaboration with suppliers, industry engagement, and advocacy to support the roll-out of effective deposit return schemes. To learn more about our methodology for these targets, and for additional details, please see the corresponding accounting policies below. Target 1: 100% recyclable, reusable or renewable packaging by 2030 We aim for all our packaging to be 100% recyclable, reusable or renewable by 2030. The scope of the target includes all primary packaging that is in direct contact with our products, i.e. bottles (glass and plastic), cans and plastic kegs. Our actions in this area are focused on increasing our use of recyclable, reusable or renewable packaging to minimise our environmental impact. In 2024, we continued to undertake analysis of our primary packaging. Through improving our data collection, we have increased our understanding of our performance and developed a roadmap of specific actions to achieve our ambitions. This will enable us to measure and report on our performance and identify challenges and opportunities to achieve our policy commitment of reducing consumption of packaging materials and promoting their reuse and recycling. We have developed a clear roadmap of actions to drive progress and are now expanding our focus from primary packaging to secondary packaging as well. In 2024, 94% of our packaging was recyclable, renewable or reusable. This is also the baseline year for this target, and this performance is in line with our expectations. Please see the Performance on targets 1-3 table on page 86 for a breakdown by material type. Target 2: 90% collection and recycling rate for bottles and cans by 2030 We are targeting a 90% collection and recycling rate for bottles (glass and plastic), cans and kegs (plastic and steel) by 2030. We measure progress by comparing hectolitres of beer sold in each market with the recycling rate for each packaging type in that market. To read about our actions to address this target, see the section “Addressing our financial opportunity: initiating deposit return and recycling schemes” on page 86. In 2024, our markets globally achieved an average collection and recycling rate of 76%, representing an increase of 4 percentage points from our 2019 baseline of 72%. Matching our expectations, this performance reflects major positive developments in deposit return schemes and industry partnerships. Please see the Performance on targets 1-3 table on page 86 for a breakdown by material type. Target 3: 50% recycled content in bottles and cans by 2030 We aim to reach 50% recycled content in our bottles (glass and plastic), cans and plastic kegs by 2030.

"Addressing our financial opportunity: initiating deposit return and recycling schemes (E5-2) By promoting industry-driven non-profit deposit return schemes (DRSs), we can create a higher level of resilience in our packaging value chain. High return rates can reduce the risk of environmental fees on our packaging and maintain the high value of clean mono-materials in a closed recycling loop for beer and beverage packaging. This creation of circular material flows also contributes to a future-proofed business model in a world with increasing material scarcity. As our DMA indicated, recycling and DRSs represent a material financial opportunity for our business. As they are also a key lever for reaching our ZERO Packaging Waste goals, facilitating their creation and development in markets around the world is one of our priorities. We have, for many years, been active in developing recycling and DRSs in many of our markets, with significant improvements in return rates for bottles and cans achieved in all four Nordic and all three Baltic countries. We are exploring expanding these efforts in regions with low recycling rates, such as Asia and Central & Eastern Europe, and supporting the continued implementation across Western Europe. In 2024, we finalised a position paper advocating for DRSs as the optimal separate collection system for beverage packaging, based on research and experience across our markets. We also hosted a workshop in Latvia for our European markets and local representatives from the DRS scheme in Latvia to exchange best practice and tools for implementation. Improving existing DRSs and supporting the roll-out of effective DRSs in more markets will increase our collection rate, helping us to reach our 2030 target and meet our policy commitment to play an active role in improving and building beverage packaging systems with less environmental impact.

Target 4: 50% reduction in virgin fossil-based plastic by 2030 We aim to reduce our use of virgin fossil-based plastic by 50% by 2030 compared with 2019. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of plastic needed through lightweighting, or by replacing virgin fossil-based plastic with recycled content or renewable materials, such as recycled PET or PEF. We are taking action to increase the recycled content in our bottles and reduce the virgin fossil-based plastic in our packaging. This will reduce the negative impact of the significant volume of packaging materials we use. We continue to partner with local suppliers to explore ways to increase recycled content in plastic bottles on a market-by-market level, for example achieving 80% recycled content across our PET portfolio in Norway. These actions address targets 3 and 4. Our actions and innovations are minimising the need for virgin materials and contributing to our policy objectives of reducing consumption of packaging materials and promoting their reuse and recycling. We also achieve this commitment by lightweighting and by replacing virgin materials with recycled content or renewable materials, such as recycled PET. In 2024, we used 48 kt of virgin plastic in our primary packaging materials, representing a decrease of 20% from our 2019 baseline of 60 kt.

"ACCOUNTING POLICIES Rate of recyclable, reusable or renewable packaging is calculated as the volume of beverages sold in recyclable, reusable or renewable primary packaging materials (excl. steel kegs) divided by the total volumes sold. Reusable: the material must be designed to be used more than twice in the same application. Renewable: the material must be made of biomass that can be continually replenished, and any biomass used for packaging solutions should comply with the sustainability requirements of the EU regulatory framework. Recyclable: see accounting policy on ""share of recyclable content in packaging"" in E5-5 for definition. The recycling rate is the average recycling and collection rate for primary packaging (excl. steel kegs), weighted based on production volume. Where reusable glass bottles are lost in the market, we assume the standard recycling rate for the country, as used for one-way glass bottles. The rate of recycled content is the average share of recycled content in primary packaging (excl. steel kegs), weighted across different packaging types using the beverage production volume they carry. See accounting policy on ""weight of recycled or reused materials"" in E5-4 for definition. Virgin plastic use is calculated as the weight of virgin plastic purchased. This covers plastic materials used in primary, secondary and tertiary packaging. Virgin plastics are defined as those not purchased as recycled or reused materials (see accounting policy on “weight of recycled or reused materials” in E5-4 for definition). Packaging mix includes the share of total production volume of beer and soft drinks packed in primary packaging types, calculated as the volume (hl) of beverage produced in a packaging type divided by total production volume. A higher degree of measurement uncertainty is present in the input data for the above-mentioned metrics. For more details, see Appendix 3 (BP-2) on pages 108-109. Current and future allocated resources For the purchasing of recycled packaging materials, primarily recycled PET, we invested DKK 120m in OpEx in 2024. In 2025, the investment is expected to be within the range of DKK 130-170m in OpEx. This includes investments in rPET. The costs of purchasing cardboard or solid board with recycled materials as well as reusable glass bottles are not captured here due to the practice being a mainstream and thoroughly integrated part of our packaging procurement processes already. These costs are not specifically segmented in our accounting and are reported based on the general rules for financial reporting.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Total weight of products and biological materials includes agricultural ingredients (adjuncts: e.g. barley and rice; other ingredients: e.g. hops and sugar; process materials: e.g. brewing additives and yeast) and packaging materials (primary: aluminium, glass and plastic; secondary and tertiary: e.g. corrugated and hi-cone). The inflow is directly measured through procurement reports and includes all material inflow related to the production of beverages. We apply a consistent cut-off period and a standardised classification system across all regions. Total weight of recycled or reused materials is defined as materials that have been reprocessed or recovered after post-consumer usage with the consumer being either a downstream customer (industry) or end-consumer. The inflow of recycled content includes primary, secondary and tertiary packaging materials. The share of reused or recycled content is calculated as the weight of recycled and reused materials divided by the total material inflow. Biological materials that are sustainably sourced is calculated as the weight of sustainably sourced biological materials divided by the total inflow of biological materials. The total inflow of biological materials includes raw materials (including barley, sugar, syrup and wheat) and biological packaging materials (including cardboard). For the definition of sustainably sourced materials, please see the accounting policy for share of raw materials that are sustainably sourced on page 83. Share of recyclable content in packaging is calculated as the weight of recyclable packaging materials divided by the total weight of packaging materials (primary, secondary and tertiary). To be considered recyclable, the specific packaging material must be technically designed to fit into a recycling stream that has been proven to work in practice and at scale in a representative market. The methodology follows the principles of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's (EMF) global approach. To assess the technical recyclability of PET materials, a component-specific assessment is conducted on the colour and barrier of the product. A higher degree of measurement uncertainty is present in the input data for the above-mentioned metrics. For more details, see Appendix 3 (BP-2) on pages 108-109.

"SOCIAL S1 OWN WORKFORCE MATERIAL IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES SBM-3 The roughly 33,000 employees who make up our own workforce form the cornerstone of all we do at Carlsberg, and we take great care to listen to and engage with them in order to create the best workplace possible. Our DMA identified six material impacts related to our own workforce over the short term, five of which are negative and one of which is positive. All employees and contractors are potentially subject to these impacts and are included in the scope of our disclosure. The following section discusses how we understand the interests of and engage with our employees, as well as the policies, targets and actions that address our material impacts. How our S1 Own workforce IROs link to our value chain AGRICULTURE PACKAGING BEVERAGE PRODUCTION & ADMINISTRATION DISTRIBUTION SELLING & MARKETING Material impact Where it originates How it affects people or planet Time horizon Addressed in TTZAB Health and safety during production processes Health and safety incidents occur at Carlsberg related to production and distribution processes. Incidents could occur anywhere in the business without a robust programme and culture to prevent them. Impacts range from minor to severe physical injury, with a potential risk of fatalities. Short term ZERO Accidents Culture Human Rights Gender disparity in senior management We have an unequal representation of genders in senior management. This issue could potentially affect all markets. Imbalanced gender representation in senior management signifies disparities in the hiring, training, pay and promotion of women in the workplace. Short term Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Healthy work-life balance We ensure all our employees across all locations are entitled to sick leave, holiday and parental leave, and offer flexible working options so employees can enjoy a healthy work-life balance and good working conditions. Promoting a healthy work-life balance contributes to improved employee satisfaction, the ability to attract and retain employees, and reputational benefits. Short term Human Rights Living by our Compass Collective bargaining and work-related human rights We operate in countries with a higher risk of human rights issues, which could potentially impact our employees' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining. Infringement of the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining can undermine employees’ abilities to collectively advocate for their rights, interests and wellbeing. Short term Human Rights Living by our Compass Workforce harassment Workforce harassment impacts employees at Carlsberg, as seen in SpeakUp cases. Incidents could occur anywhere in the business without a robust programme and culture to prevent them. Impacts include stress, physical harassment and lack of a safe working environment. These impacts could particularly affect vulnerable groups, such as migrant workers and women. Short term Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Living by our Compass Human Rights Wage adequacy There is a potential risk of workers being paid inadequate wages, especially in markets outside the European Economic Area. Not paying adequate wages could have negative impacts on workers' and their dependants’ ability to meet their basic needs. Short term Human Rights Living by our Compass Additional SBM-3 disclosures required of CSRD: No significant risk of forced or child labour has been identified in our operations. Our transition plans for achieving greener and climate-neutral operations do not have any major implications for material impacts on workers.
