"Addressing our financial opportunity: initiating deposit return and recycling schemes (E5-2) By promoting industry-driven non-profit deposit return schemes (DRSs), we can create a higher level of resilience in our packaging value chain. High return rates can reduce the risk of environmental fees on our packaging and maintain the high value of clean mono-materials in a closed recycling loop for beer and beverage packaging. This creation of circular material flows also contributes to a future-proofed business model in a world with increasing material scarcity. As our DMA indicated, recycling and DRSs represent a material financial opportunity for our business. As they are also a key lever for reaching our ZERO Packaging Waste goals, facilitating their creation and development in markets around the world is one of our priorities. We have, for many years, been active in developing recycling and DRSs in many of our markets, with significant improvements in return rates for bottles and cans achieved in all four Nordic and all three Baltic countries. We are exploring expanding these efforts in regions with low recycling rates, such as Asia and Central & Eastern Europe, and supporting the continued implementation across Western Europe. In 2024, we finalised a position paper advocating for DRSs as the optimal separate collection system for beverage packaging, based on research and experience across our markets. We also hosted a workshop in Latvia for our European markets and local representatives from the DRS scheme in Latvia to exchange best practice and tools for implementation. Improving existing DRSs and supporting the roll-out of effective DRSs in more markets will increase our collection rate, helping us to reach our 2030 target and meet our policy commitment to play an active role in improving and building beverage packaging systems with less environmental impact.

Target 4: 50% reduction in virgin fossil-based plastic by 2030 We aim to reduce our use of virgin fossil-based plastic by 50% by 2030 compared with 2019. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of plastic needed through lightweighting, or by replacing virgin fossil-based plastic with recycled content or renewable materials, such as recycled PET or PEF. We are taking action to increase the recycled content in our bottles and reduce the virgin fossil-based plastic in our packaging. This will reduce the negative impact of the significant volume of packaging materials we use. We continue to partner with local suppliers to explore ways to increase recycled content in plastic bottles on a market-by-market level, for example achieving 80% recycled content across our PET portfolio in Norway. These actions address targets 3 and 4. Our actions and innovations are minimising the need for virgin materials and contributing to our policy objectives of reducing consumption of packaging materials and promoting their reuse and recycling. We also achieve this commitment by lightweighting and by replacing virgin materials with recycled content or renewable materials, such as recycled PET. In 2024, we used 48 kt of virgin plastic in our primary packaging materials, representing a decrease of 20% from our 2019 baseline of 60 kt. This performance is driven, in particular, by increasing the use of recycled materials and it is in line with our expectations.
