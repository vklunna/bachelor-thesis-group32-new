The Group’s widespread presence throughout the country not only has a direct impact on its own workforce, value chain workers and customers, both through its operations and through its business relationships77, but also extends to the local communities affected by operations related to the construction and maintenance of assets and to the natural capital they host. The complexity of the operating environment, fuelled by the need to balance business objectives with the impacts of its activities on society and the environment, requires great responsibility that the Group has committed itself to addressing through a Just Transition approach. The ambition is to achieve an energy transition that is also fair and inclusive, taking into account the possible social effect and impact. With this in mind, starting with the Industrial Plan 2024-2028, the Terna Group has chosen to integrate a Sustainability Plan within the Industrial Plan that aims to manage material impacts, risks and opportunities, orienting the Company’s strategy towards the creation of value over time. 77 For more details on the nature of the Group’s business activities and relationships, please refer to that which is reported in response to ESRS 2, SBM-1.

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business In order to ensure business management that aims to achieve sustainable success and value creation over time, the Group adopts an approach that starts with considering possible impacts on relevant stakeholder categories and the environment, which it mitigates and manages through sustainability planning integrated in the corporate strategy, aimed at minimising environmental impacts, involving local stakeholders and, more generally, respecting the principles of integrity, responsibility and transparency. In this context, the Double Materiality Assessment, through regular monitoring of material impacts, risks and opportunities, represents the compass of the Group’s Sustainability Plan, guiding, in this sense, the adaptation of the corporate strategy. This approach makes it possible to identify and manage any critical issues in a timely manner and to increase the resilience of the business model in relation to any negative effects relating to sustainability matters. For the purposes of continuous improvement, the update of the Sustainability Plan 2024-2028 envisages a set of actions aimed at ensuring full consideration of the results of the Double Materiality also with a view to implementing the provisions of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. Through such a roadmap, it will be possible to lay the necessary foundations to further strengthen a structured and timely resilience analysis consisting of all material IROs. Finally, in light of the materiality of the topic, specifically in relation to climate change impacts and risks, the Group has developed an appropriate resilience analysis methodology with a science-based approach, in order to verify the resilience of its assets to climate change. As regards the quantification of the actual financial effects of material risks and opportunities, the analysis conducted by the Terna Group shows that the conditions do not exist, in line with the relevant international accounting policies, for the recognition of financial effects attributable to ESG risks and opportunities in the consolidated financial statements 2024, since to date these risks correspond to possible, not probable obligations."
"188 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Climate Change By virtue of the particular importance that the topic of climate change holds for the Group , as part of the Double Materiality process, impacts, risks, and opportunities specifically related to the topic in question are identified and assessed. With particular reference to the process of identifying impacts, the Group methodically integrated the analysis through an assessment of its own activities and value chain. In particular, it proceeded with an in-depth assessment of its operational and strategic activities, assessing both direct and indirect activities relating to the value chain, considering their actual and potential future sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this regard, the assessment of the Group’s climate- related impacts was based on the quantification of the carbon footprint measured through the inventory of total GHG emissions, which provides for the reporting of both direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2 and 3) emissions, in line with the main internationally recognised methodologies (e.g. the GHG Protocol). Continuous monitoring and the adoption of advanced assessment tools enable the company to refine its climate management model, supporting emission reduction and climate risk mitigation strategies. As already mentioned in the paragraph ’Main Risks and Uncertainties’, risk management is applied throughout the Company according to a structured and systemic approach and provides for a Risk Governance Framework (framework), included in the broader Internal Audit and Risk Management System (IARMS), which defines the roles and responsibilities of the main players involved. This dynamic process is based on a three-tier control model and involves both the Control Functions and the Chief Risk Officer. It should also be noted that the ‘Sustainability’ function, which is part of the ‘Strategy, Digital and Sustainability’ Department and to which the activities of identifying, managing and monitoring sustainability issues (including climate change) is included, as a second level of control, within the model. In this context, the risks associated with climate change represent risks that are closely related to the Group’s operational and strategic environment, therefore the process leading to the identification, assessment and management of these risks is integrated into the general corporate risk management process and into the current management of the undertaking’s activities (for more details, please refer to the section ‘Double Materiality Process’). In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, risks related to climate change were distinguished between physical risks (extreme weather events, long-term climate variations) and transition- related risks (regulatory, technological and market developments): • Transition risks: transitioning to a lower-carbon economy may entail policy and legal risks, due to different regulatory requirements across different geographies, or to new impacts and/or uncertainties resulting from the policies adopted. The transition may also result in technology risk, due to uncertainties surrounding the role of emerging technologies, and market risk, linked to new dynamics, shifts in supply and demand and an increasingly complex market environment, which could expose businesses to reputational risks; • Physical risks: these risks can be event driven (acute) or longer-term shifts (chronic) in climate patterns. Physical risks may have financial implications for businesses, such as direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption. In order to identify and assess the risks related to this topic, Terna Group adopts an integrated approach based on scenario analyses, with the aim of ensuring the security, reliability and resilience of the National Transmission Grid (NTG). The assessment process considers both physical risks related to weather events, extreme and otherwise, and transition-related risks arising from the evolution of the energy system towards decarbonisation. As part of the identification and assessment of physical climate-related risks, the Group, starting in 2020, equipped itself with a tool called the Resilience Methodology, whose forward-looking nature in monitoring the evolution and impact of the climate in the coming decades, as well as the probabilistic nature necessary to assess multiple failures and contingencies and the consequent risk of energy not being supplied on the grid following the occurrence of severe weather events, allow for the implementation of effective and efficient planning of interventions to increase the resilience of the transmission grid. Over the course of these years, the Resilience Methodology has undergone continuous change and has been refined to consolidate analyses on snow and high-wind weather events, even to include the launch of analyses on weather phenomena FOCUS E1 | SBM-3 > E1 | IRO-1 > OTHER DOCUMENTS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT ON OPERATIONS"

AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT • First level of control: with primary responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing the risks appertaining to the specific areas of responsibility; • Second level of control: assigned to organisational structures (e.g. Health & Safety, Compliance, 262 Oversight, Environmental Protection, Fraud Management, Privacy, Cybersecurity, etc.) acting as autonomous, independent units that are separate from operational units. This level of control oversees changes in external regulations and in the related best practices and participate in the definition of governance policies and in the process of managing the risk categories for which it is responsible. At the same time, they provide support to the First Level of Control for their implementation, including through the design and delivery of awareness and training activities; • Third level of control: conducted by the Audit department, providing an independent assessment of the design and functionality of the internal audit and risk management system (assurance). The entity that has this role has a high degree of organisational, hierarchical, and functional independence. Good risk governance must ensure a holistic and coordinated view of all the actors involved, so that they may work together, identify and assess risks, identify their possible impacts and, consequently, have the right information available to make the most appropriate decisions. The diverse elements of the Risk Management System give an idea of the complexity of the Framework and how the entities and departments involved, each with their own specific nature, contribute to the above holistic vision, working in synergy and in accordance with a structured and organised approach. To this end, Terna puts in place procedures and processes to coordinate the relations and activities of the entities that exercise control at various levels. In this regard, coordination between the activities of the second-level control departments is particularly important, in order to minimise duplication of activities and maximise the efficiency of the risk management system, while respecting their respective roles and responsibilities, and the necessary independence requirements.

In 2024, Terna, as part of the corporate plan to adapt to the new regulations on sustainability reporting, started defining and progressively implementing a control model aimed at establishing and maintaining an Internal Control System on Sustainability Statement (SCIIS), aimed at overseeing the reliability of such disclosures and their compliance with the reporting standards established at European level (ESRS) and the specifications adopted pursuant to Article 8, paragraph 4, of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (so-called EU Taxonomy). The SCIIS also has the objective of supporting the Chief Executive Officer and the Manager responsible for preparing the Terna Group’s financial reporting in issuing certifications to the Market regarding the compliance of the Terna Group’s Consolidated Sustainability Statement. The SCIIS is an integral part of the Terna Group’s Internal Audit and Risk Management System, consisting of the set of rules, procedures and organisational structures that, through an adequate process of identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the main risks, allow the Company to manage them correctly and consistently with its objectives.

"214 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT The control model for sustainability Statement is methodologically based on the framework developed by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (so-called ‘CoSO Report’), which, in March 2023, published a specific supplementary guide dedicated to sustainability reporting, entitled ‘Achieving Effective Internal Control of Sustainability Reporting (ICSR)’. Consistent with the principles of the CoSO Report, the SCIIS management process is structured into the following main phases: • Scoping; • Analysis of risks and controls; • Monitoring; • Assessment and reporting. The identification of the areas of greatest risk for the sustainability statement is carried out as part of the scoping phase through a risk/materiality analysis of the data (KPIs) included in the Terna Group’s Consolidated Sustainability Statement, based on assessment drivers that take into account endogenous and exogenous risk factors. For the KPIs assessed to be of higher risk/materiality and for the Group companies that contribute significantly to them, an additional risk analysis is carried out, according to a top-down, risk-based approach, concerning the business processes from which these KPIs originate. In particular, risk analysis at the process level consists of identifying events that may compromise the qualitative characteristics (relevance, faithful representation, comparability, verifiability and understandability) that the data and information presented in the Consolidated Sustainability Statement prepared in accordance with the ESRS standards must fulfil. In this area, the assessments carried out highlighted the following main categories of risk: (i) completeness and integrity of data; (ii) availability and timeliness of data; (iii) traceability of data; (iv) authorisation of data and information; and (v) compliance with relevant legislation. The following main types of controls are envisaged in order to properly monitor these risks: • approval and management review controls; • data reconciliation checks; • consistency checks of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement with respect to the relevant ESRS; • logical access controls and traceability of operations performed on the system used for the Consolidated Sustainability Statement; • consistency checks by analysing the variance of data within the time series available. It should also be noted that the process of collecting and consolidating sustainability data and information and drafting the Consolidated Sustainability Statement is supported by the use of an IT application that represents a further integral risk mitigation factor that enables structured data collection flows, automatic controls and monitoring dashboards. A further general element of risk mitigation on Consolidated Sustainability Statement is represented by the Terna Group’s ‘control environment’, consisting of the set of ‘ethical values’ and cultural values, the governance and organisational model, the Leadership style exercised by Senior Management and Management, and by the personnel management policies, aimed at establishing a general context designed to ensure that process activities are carried out and controlled in accordance with the principles and objectives defined by management. The SCIIS provides for a periodic assessment phase of the adequacy of the design and effective application of the controls of which it is composed. The results of these assessments are analysed and evaluated by management in order to define, where appropriate, corrective actions to be implemented in the relevant processes.

"216 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT The remuneration system In line with Terna’s governance framework, the Board of Directors is responsible for setting and updating the objectives and approving the results of the incentive schemes to which the variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is linked, and for defining the general criteria for the remuneration of Key Management Personnel. In keeping with the recommendations in the Corporate Governance Code, relating to matters concerning remuneration, the Board of Directors is supported by a Remuneration and Nominations Committee consisting of independent, non- executive Directors tasked with providing related recommendations and advice. Remuneration policy The Terna Group has designed its Remuneration Policy in line with stakeholders’ expectations and market best practices and in accordance with the principles and criteria set out in the Corporate Governance Code. The Group also ensures the maximum alignment between shareholders and management, in terms of both value creation and the risk profile established. The Board of Directors ensures that the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager is the beneficiary of a policy that is in line with the principles contained in the Corporate Governance Code. This means ensuring that a significant part of remuneration is linked to the achievement of specific performance objectives, including those of a non-financial nature (e.g., ESG indicators). In the pay mix, care is also taken to ensure that long-term incentives are given more weight than those of a short-term nature. The same principles underpin the policy for Key Management Personnel. To support achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives and its performance, which include ESG goals, variable incentives schemes diversified on the basis of the different roles within the Company have been adopted: • Short-Term Incentives (STIs) for company management, which links the amount of individual bonuses: - to the degree to which quantitative targets have been met, at both Company and individual level, with a portion linked to the Group’s environmental and social commitments (e.g., workplace safety indicators); - to a qualitative assessment of performance, based on management behaviours. • Long-Term Incentives (LTIs), long-term incentive plans, linked to multi-year business objectives, including sustainability- related objectives, for managers in the most important roles with regard to achievement of strategic results. In particular, in relation to the choice of indicators underlying the short- and long-term incentive schemes, Terna’s remuneration policy is geared towards the achievement of ESG objectives, including those related to actions against climate change. First and foremost, the reference is to the objective, introduced in the LTI plan in 2023 and confirmed in 2024, directly linked to the realisation of the energy transition that rewards the maximization of production from non-programmable renewable sources and promote their integration into the National Electricity System, minimizing Overgeneration. This objective is therefore aimed at ensuring the efficient penetration of non-programmable renewable sources into the energy mix fed into the grid; it is also decisive and can be linked to the reduction of the emission factor affecting Terna’s Science Based Target. This applies, in particular, to the achievement of the Scope 2 target, accounting for 96% of the base year value (2019)90. In addition, other objectives were also confirmed in 2024 - for the Chief Executive Officer/General Manager and for the executives with strategic responsibility - relating to the development of the network infrastructure, such as, for example, quality of service, output incentives (DSM and inter-zonal) and investments and entries into service related to the regulated sector, which are the basis for the country’s transition to a zero-carbon economy. Incentive mechanisms attributable to the fight against climate change have long been envisaged not only for the first line, but also for the rest of the incentivised population, with remuneration objectives that, in addition to replicating that which has been indicated above for top management, have also concerned, for example, the development of electric 90 For additional information, reference should also be made to page 243.

NO Accounting standards and contextual information The accounting policy, namely the method for calculating the shares of revenue, CapEx and OpEx associated with the eligible and aligned activities identified by the Group, is based on the provisions of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. For the purposes of allocating revenue, CapEx and OpEx to eligible and aligned activities, Terna has defined a clear and traceable methodology to meet quantitative and qualitative information needs. Specifically, the Group has reconstructed the indicators using data from the general, industrial and regulatory accounts. Details of the methodology used to calculate the individual indicators are as follows: To calculate the share of Revenue, the numerator is taken to be the consolidated net revenue generated by the sale of products or services, including intangibles, associated with taxonomy eligible and aligned economic activities, and the denominator is taken to be total net revenue (based on the criteria set out in point 1.1.1 of Annex 1 to Delegated Regulation 2178/2021). Net revenue has been identified by using data from the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and with reference to the provisions of IAS 1, paragraph 82(a), to the extent directly attributable to the sale of goods and/or provision of services. None of the figures in the reported amounts relate to economic activities included in the taxonomy carried out for the Group’s internal consumption. To calculate the share of CapEx, the numerator is taken to be capital expenditure recognised as assets in the consolidated balance sheet and associated with eligible and aligned activities, as defined according to the criteria set out in point 1.1.2.2 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. The denominator is taken to be total capital expenditure, quantified in accordance with the criteria set out in point 1.1.2.1 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. Specifically, the denominator comprises additions to tangible and intangible assets for the period before depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses and any revaluations, including those arising restatements and impairments, and excluding changes in fair value. To calculate the share of CapEx, the numerator is taken to be operating expenditure recognised in the consolidated financial statements and associated with eligible and aligned activities, as defined according to the criteria set out in point 1.1.3.2 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. The denominator is taken to be total operating expenditure, quantified in accordance with the criteria set out in point 1.1.3.1 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021.

"232 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Climate change [ESRS E1] Strategy Terna Group’s decarbonisation process As Italy’s national grid operator, Terna plays a central role in Italy’s energy transition process. Its sustainability and decarbonisation strategy is not only required by global climate change objectives and Italy’s international commitments; indeed, it marks a strategic choice that responds to a long-term vision, in which the electricity system becomes the main driver of energy transformation. The Group has always operated with the aim of ensuring a safe, reliable and efficient electricity system, while reducing its environmental impact and actively contributing to combat climate change. Over the years, Terna Group has adopted a series of concrete initiatives and strategic investments aimed at promoting environmental sustainability, ensuring efficient grid management and facilitating the integration of renewable energy into the system. By developing advanced technologies, digitalising infrastructures and adopting increasingly innovative operating models, the Company is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, while contributing to the decarbonisation of the entire National Electricity System. Terna Group’s sustainability strategy is built on solid foundations, based on a thorough understanding of its strategic role and its responsibility towards the environment and the community. The Company has invested considerable resources in the modernisation of the transmission grid, in order to optimise the integration capacity of renewable energies and reduce grid losses, which are two key aspects for achieving national and European climate change objectives. The Group has also developed and is currently developing innovative tools for smart grid management, exploiting the potential of new digital technologies and automation solutions to increase operational efficiency and improve the resilience of the electricity system. The adoption of sophisticated real-time monitoring and control systems optimises management of the energy flow, promoting a more effective use of available renewable sources and reducing the need for more polluting energy sources. These initiatives have contributed and still contribute directly to improving, year after year, the national production energy mix and the related CO2 emission factor. At company level, this aspect is confirmed by the constant decrease in emissions associated with grid losses, which account for more than 90% of the Group’s total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and which move in the same direction as the national emission factor, with the same grid losses (indeed, these emissions are the product of grid losses and the national emission factor, expected to be a zero factor thanks to the integration of renewables - and will correspond to zero grid loss emissions). In order to confirm its commitment to combating climate change, Terna Group has adopted Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement’s trajectory, and a Scope 3 emission reduction target, all validated and certified by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), an internationally recognised framework for setting emission reduction targets in line with the latest scientific evidence. With respect to the Scope 3 emission reduction target, the Group is currently adjusting the scope of the target to bring it in line with the applicable legislation. The main initiatives implemented by the Group to achieve these targets include, first and foremost, the above- mentioned capital expenditure to integrate renewable sources into the Italian electricity system and the digitalisation of grid infrastructure, in addition to the optimisation of operating processes by adopting more efficient and sustainable technologies and improving the energy efficiency of its facilities. Terna’s approach to decarbonisation is not limited solely to reducing its own direct emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2). Indeed, it also includes the commitment to reduce indirect emissions along the value chain (Scope 3), through targeted engagement actions with suppliers, industrial partners and relevant stakeholders. With a view to constantly raise its ambition in combating climate change, when publishing the 2024-2028 Industrial Plan update in March 2025, the Group officially announced its commitment to the Science Based Targets Initiative to define a net zero target within two years.

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business The National Grid Development Plan is a key aspect of Terna Group’s sustainability strategy. This is a strategic document that guides investments in modernising and upgrading the country’s electricity infrastructure. This plan, which is drawn up in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security, plays a central role in Italy’s energy transition process, as it ensures the security and reliability of the electricity system in a context characterised by the growing penetration of renewable sources. One of the main goals of the Development Plan is to help achieve the European target of a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This is an ambitious goal that requires the joint commitment from all energy actors. To this end, Terna is investing in a series of strategic projects, which include strengthening the interconnections with neighbouring countries to improve the security and flexibility of the electricity system, integrating the increasing renewable capacity through the development of new grid infrastructure and advanced demand management solutions, and digitalising the grid with the implementation of innovative technologies to monitor and control the energy flow. Therefore, the Development Plan of the national transmission grid is a fundamental tool for the decarbonisation of the Italian electricity system and to achieve the climate targets set at national and European level. In this respect, although the Group does not currently have a transition plan for the decarbonisation of its operations (Scope 1, 2 and 3) that fully meets all ESRS requirements, Terna’s Development Plan can be considered a transition plan for the Italian system, given the direct link between the plan’s capital expenditure and the country’s decarbonisation. With respect to the Group’s transition planning, while considering the central role of the Development Plan also for the purposes of the Group’s decarbonisation (see the information about the emissions related to grid losses) - it is being developed a transition plan in the medium term that will provide a clear and detailed picture of the objectives and actions underway in line with its sustainability strategy and commitment to net zero. This plan will be a further step forward in Terna Group’s commitment to sustainability, outlining in even greater detail the strategies, timing and capital expenditure necessary to achieve net zero emissions, and keeping temperature increase below 1.5°C in line with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement, confirming its role as a leader in the country’s energy transformation."

NO Accounting standards and contextual information The accounting policy, namely the method for calculating the shares of revenue, CapEx and OpEx associated with the eligible and aligned activities identified by the Group, is based on the provisions of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. For the purposes of allocating revenue, CapEx and OpEx to eligible and aligned activities, Terna has defined a clear and traceable methodology to meet quantitative and qualitative information needs. Specifically, the Group has reconstructed the indicators using data from the general, industrial and regulatory accounts. Details of the methodology used to calculate the individual indicators are as follows: To calculate the share of Revenue, the numerator is taken to be the consolidated net revenue generated by the sale of products or services, including intangibles, associated with taxonomy eligible and aligned economic activities, and the denominator is taken to be total net revenue (based on the criteria set out in point 1.1.1 of Annex 1 to Delegated Regulation 2178/2021). Net revenue has been identified by using data from the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with international accounting standards and with reference to the provisions of IAS 1, paragraph 82(a), to the extent directly attributable to the sale of goods and/or provision of services. None of the figures in the reported amounts relate to economic activities included in the taxonomy carried out for the Group’s internal consumption. To calculate the share of CapEx, the numerator is taken to be capital expenditure recognised as assets in the consolidated balance sheet and associated with eligible and aligned activities, as defined according to the criteria set out in point 1.1.2.2 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. The denominator is taken to be total capital expenditure, quantified in accordance with the criteria set out in point 1.1.2.1 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. Specifically, the denominator comprises additions to tangible and intangible assets for the period before depreciation and amortisation, impairment losses and any revaluations, including those arising restatements and impairments, and excluding changes in fair value. To calculate the share of CapEx, the numerator is taken to be operating expenditure recognised in the consolidated financial statements and associated with eligible and aligned activities, as defined according to the criteria set out in point 1.1.3.2 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. The denominator is taken to be total operating expenditure, quantified in accordance with the criteria set out in point 1.1.3.1 of Annex 1 of Delegated Regulation 2178/2021. The latter includes direct non-capitalised costs relating to: research and development; building renovation measures; short-term rentals; and maintenance and repair, as well as any other direct expenditure relating to the day- to-day maintenance of property, plant and equipment, carried out either by the company or by third parties to whom these tasks are outsourced, as needed to ensure the continuous and efficient operation of these assets. Finally, it should be noted that, as stated in the Green Bond Report, the Group has issued environmentally sustainable bonds over the years that finance taxonomy-aligned activities. The contribution of green bond issues in 2024 amounts to 12% of aligned CapEx."

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business The capital expenditure made by the Terna Group in 2024 in connection with the Resilience Plan amounted to €160.7 million (including capitalised financial expenses). It was recognised under the consolidated financial statements items “Property, plant and equipment” and “Intangible assets”. Under the EU Taxonomy, they are entirely allocated to activity 4.9, KPI CapEx both eligible and aligned. The related future capital expenditure is aligned with the amounts of the Regulated Activities provided for in the 2024-2028 Industrial Plan Update to which reference should be made. Climate change mitigation and energy As described in the section “Terna Group’s decarbonisation process”, in 2024, the Group implemented various actions to reduce its impact in terms of GHG Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The actions described in relation to climate change mitigation are broken down by decarbonisation levers in order to provide a more specific picture of the Group’s commitment to this topic. Thanks to these initiatives, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2024 amounted to 1,351,212 tonnes of CO2e, down 26% from 2019, the Group’s science-based target year. SF6 gas management Direct greenhouse gas emissions connected with Terna Group’s activities derive mainly from SF6 gas leaks (85% of total direct emissions in 2024). SF6 (sulphur hexafluoride) gas is used as insulation in certain electrical equipment (circuit breakers, current transformers and armoured equipment). Part of the gas in the equipment can leak into the atmosphere due to defective seals, when faults occur, and also sometimes during the re-pressuring process. SF6 gas has a very powerful greenhouse effect, which is 23,500 times greater than CO2: leakage into the atmosphere of 1 kg of SF6 is equivalent to 23.5 tonnes of CO2. The amount of SF6 present in the Group’s infrastructure has consistently grown. This is a trend linked to the better insulating performance of this gas and the smaller footprint of substations built (“armoured”) with equipment containing SF6 in comparison with more traditional solutions. This is a significant aspect for Italy, which has landscapes of major value and is densely populated. Furthermore, because of the need to develop the transmission grid in order to foster the integration of renewable sources and achieve the transition to a zero-carbon economy as per the EU guidelines, new plants using SF6 gas as an insulator will be built in the future. Consequently, the amount of gas installed will inevitably grow over time. Against this backdrop, Terna Group is constantly researching solutions to contain greenhouse gas emissions from SF6 leaks. Specifically, in 2024, maintenance and replacement of SF6-insulated circuit breakers and current transformers (CTs) and SF6-armoured equipment continued. In particular, since 2024, a monthly monitoring process of SF6 leaks on CTs, circuit breakers and armoured equipment (GIS or gas-insulated substations) has been in place, covering the entire national transmission grid. Indeed, ongoing monitoring enables the early detection of irregularities and prevents significant leaks through maintenance and replacement actions. In addition to this, in 2024, an experimental project to contain SF6 leaks (“SF6 Hexatrap”) has been launched. This solution, which is highly experimental and innovative and is intended for GIS installations, includes a metal cover expressly designed for a specific flange, guaranteeing tightness thanks to rubber o-rings. Its effectiveness will be assessed using a sniffer analysis and by comparing SF6 top ups before and after installation. This project is also mapped within the Circular Economy Roadmap with which it shares sustainable and environmental goals. In the future, there are plans to identify new test sites in order to test another solution which uses “pastes” based on metal compounds to repair cracks as well as tighten and contain leaks at the flange coupling of a GIS. Finally, insulation and interruption solutions based on SF6 substitutes are currently being studied. Specifically, already in 2022, a new connection standard using a new voltage level of 36 kV nominal has been introduced to more efficiently connect renewable production up to a maximum power of 100 MW. The strength of this new voltage level lies in the possibility of using alternative technologies to the SF6 gas, which already exist and are"

Terna has opted for air- insulation and vacuum interruption as the essential technical specification for prefabricated metal-case equipment (panels) to be used for this voltage level. The type and legal tests of the first SF6-free equipment at 145 kV voltage level (circuit breakers and current transformers) began in 2024, while the first experimental installations will be carried out in 2025, after completion of the necessary certifications. Decarbonisation of Italy’s energy mix As mentioned earlier, more than 90% of the Group’s total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are associated with grid losses. Grid losses are defined as the difference between energy injected by producers (including imported energy) and final consumption; the losses for Terna Group are those associated with the transmission grid. Grid losses are a physical effect of the electricity lost as it passes through conductors and during transformation. Losses are influenced by the level of voltage, the volume of electricity transported, the materials used and the distance between the points at which energy is produced and consumed. Terna can only determine the extent of the losses, which are not completely under its control. Grid development activities, given the same structure of production, would lead to greater efficiency and thus a reduction in losses. However, the actual impact of development initiatives on losses is unpredictable and not under the control of the transmission operator, as it depends on concomitant changes in production capacity and electricity supply and demand at local level. Dispatching operations, needed to guarantee a constant balance between injections and withdrawals and to prevent the occurrence of grid security problems and disruptions, are carried out in accordance with regulatory criteria within the production set-up created by the energy market. They cannot be influenced by Terna with the aim of minimising losses. The main benefits expected from the implementation of the measures envisaged in the 10-year Development Plan published in 2025 include the reduction in grid losses of between 0.4 and 1 TWh per year. For this reason, all actions that lead to the increased inclusion of renewable sources of the energy fed into the grid is the main action that enables Terna Group also to achieve its SBT decarbonisation targets102. The integration of renewable sources into the Italian electricity system is by far the main lever for reducing emissions related to grid losses. The volume of these emissions is directly linked to grid losses, the national production energy mix and the related CO2 emission factor. As mentioned earlier, these emissions move in the same direction as the national emission factor, with the same grid losses (indeed, these emissions are the product of grid losses and the national emission factor): the more renewable sources are integrated into the Italian electricity system, the better the national emission factor and, consequently, the lower the emissions associated with grid losses; in the future, a zero factor will correspond to zero grid loss emissions. In this respect, in 2024, 33 connection contracts were signed (representing a capacity of approximately 1,120 MW), relating to the construction of new RES plants. Furthermore, thanks to the investments envisaged in the new 2025 Development Plan, the installed solar and wind power capacity is expected to increase by more than 65 GW in 2030, compared to 2023, and by more than 94 GW in 2035. For further information, see the section on the 2025 Development Plan. With respect to decarbonisation, the Terna Group plans and includes related projects in the capital expenditure made to develop the national transmission grid. Therefore, this capital expenditure is included in the updated 2024-2028 Industrial Plan and in the consolidated financial statements items “Property, plant and equipment” and “Intangible assets”. In the EU Taxonomy, it is entirely included in activity 4.9, KPI CapEx, both eligible and aligned. 102 In the base year (2019), Scope 2 emissions in relation to total Scope 1 and Scope 2 were 96%. For this reason, the actions for the inclusion of renewables, including the target related to the reduction of the cut of renewable sources fed into the grid (overgeneration), are decisive and can be linked to the achievement of the SBT target of 96% by 2030.

With respect to electricity substations, the principal energy carriers are monitored, with measurements covering approximately 90% of the total consumption of the 24 sample electricity substations located across the country and selected according to climatic location, size and type of activity. Every year, additional transformer substations located across the country are included in the project, with overall consumption monitored on a quarter-hourly basis. The sensors installed on corporate sites send data to the EciWeb information system for deferred and/or online monitoring of energy-intensive elements (office buildings and electricity substation) relating to the high-voltage electricity transmission service. This information system is used to monitor and analyse electricity consumption in detail. In addition, 6 energy audits were carried out on Terna Group sites in 2024 in order to meet the requirements of the ISO 50001 standard. At Terna, the development of energy efficiency programmes relating to the use of electricity in substations and offices is experimental, as the Company’s electricity consumption falls within the category of “own transmission uses” which, according to the industry’s regulator, are not to be included in operating costs. With a view to improving energy performance, a number of offices have also been refurbished or are newly built under a long-term programme, which aims to upgrade the energy efficiency class of buildings owned by the Group. Proposed work at offices primarily regards improvements to the energy efficiency of lighting, air-conditioning and heating. The proposed changes at substations primarily regard the replacement of lighting towers and perimeter lighting with LED technology. The installation of sensors for online monitoring of energy consumption at corporate sites and the preparation of energy audits and energy efficiency actions take place annually. During the year, the Group consolidated its activities and processes aimed at renewing the UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC 50001:2018 certification for all the business processes of Terna S.p.A. and the following subsidiaries (Terna Rete Italia S.p.A., Terna Plus S.r.l., Terna Energy Solutions S.r.l. and Terna Crna Gora doo). Metrics and targets related to climate change Goals of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan As part of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the Terna Group has defined a series of specific targets - first and foremost the Science-based Target - aimed at assessing the progress made with respect to climate change and material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities, also to ensure a clear path towards achieving the objectives identified by the policies adopted by the Group and reported on previously. Terna Group’s targets related to the mitigation of climate change-related impacts and risks, as well as to material climate-related opportunities, in terms of GHG emissions reduction, as summarised in the Group’s Science-based Target, are in line with the Group’s decarbonisation strategy, whose content is outlined in the “Integrated Management System Policy”, with a particular focus on the Environmental Management System, and in the “Sustainability Policy”. These policies, whose structure is consistent with the provisions of the main international reference standards, such as ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and the GHG Protocol, and aligned with the national and international regulatory framework, confirm Terna Group’s main commitments and targets in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation. As mentioned earlier, the Group is actively committed to acknowledging and expanding the materiality of climate change and the need to combat it by containing CO2 emissions (e.g., by progressively integrating renewable sources), preparing periodic assessments of risks and opportunities, as well as of the environmental impacts of its activities, seeking solutions to minimise any negative effects of the latter on the environment and, finally, report transparently on its environmental activities to internal and external stakeholders.

During the year, the Group consolidated its activities and processes aimed at renewing the UNI CEI EN ISO/IEC 50001:2018 certification for all the business processes of Terna S.p.A. and the following subsidiaries (Terna Rete Italia S.p.A., Terna Plus S.r.l., Terna Energy Solutions S.r.l. and Terna Crna Gora doo). Metrics and targets related to climate change Goals of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan As part of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the Terna Group has defined a series of specific targets - first and foremost the Science-based Target - aimed at assessing the progress made with respect to climate change and material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities, also to ensure a clear path towards achieving the objectives identified by the policies adopted by the Group and reported on previously. Terna Group’s targets related to the mitigation of climate change-related impacts and risks, as well as to material climate-related opportunities, in terms of GHG emissions reduction, as summarised in the Group’s Science-based Target, are in line with the Group’s decarbonisation strategy, whose content is outlined in the “Integrated Management System Policy”, with a particular focus on the Environmental Management System, and in the “Sustainability Policy”. These policies, whose structure is consistent with the provisions of the main international reference standards, such as ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and the GHG Protocol, and aligned with the national and international regulatory framework, confirm Terna Group’s main commitments and targets in terms of climate change mitigation and adaptation. As mentioned earlier, the Group is actively committed to acknowledging and expanding the materiality of climate change and the need to combat it by containing CO2 emissions (e.g., by progressively integrating renewable sources), preparing periodic assessments of risks and opportunities, as well as of the environmental impacts of its activities, seeking solutions to minimise any negative effects of the latter on the environment and, finally, report transparently on its environmental activities to internal and external stakeholders.

"242 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT The definition of the Terna Group’s GHG emissions reduction targets is based on the identification of its impacts in terms of climate change and on the analysis of the Company’s environmental data, particularly with respect to GHG emissions. The relevant national and international targets are also considered, such as limiting global warming to 1.5°C as per 2015 Paris Climate Conference. In this respect, Terna Group’s target related to climate change mitigation, specifically the reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, was validated by SBTi (Science Based Target initiative) in 2022 and is therefore compatible with the above-mentioned limitation of global warming to 1.5°C. On the other hand, with respect to the target to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions, the Group is currently redefining its targets in order to align them to the reporting boundary as intended by the CSRD. Furthermore, with a view to constantly raise its ambition in combating climate change, when publishing the 2024-2028 Industrial Plan update in March 2025, Terna Group officially announced its commitment to the Science Based Targets Initiative to define a net zero target to 2050 within two years. With respect to the fundamental assumptions behind the definition of Terna Group’s Science-based Target, as mentioned earlier, more than 90% of the Group’s total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are associated with grid losses, and the main lever for reducing these emissions is Terna’s integration of renewable sources into the Italian electricity system103. Therefore, the definition of the target depends on the assumptions underlying the planning of grid development in line with the guidelines of the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (“PNIEC”), which applies the targets of the European “Fit-for-55” and “RepowerEU” legislative packages at national level. In particular, the PNIEC sets national objectives for 2030 on energy efficiency, renewable sources and the reduction of CO2 emissions, as well as objectives for energy security, interconnections, the single energy market and competitiveness, sustainable development and mobility, outlining for each of them the measures that will be implemented to ensure their achievement. For further information, reference should be made to the section describing the energy scenarios in the paragraph on the double materiality. When reporting GHG emissions reduction targets, the Terna Group combines Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions104. As already discussed, the main reasons behind Group’s emissions depend on the type of emissions. With respect to Scope 1 emissions, these are mainly caused by the SF6 gas which is present in Terna’s plants and whose leaks mainly affect equipment installed. On the other hand, Scope 2 emissions are mainly attributable to grid losses, in addition to electricity consumption. The scope of the GHG emissions reduction target does not differ from that of the GHG emissions reported under the E1-6 disclosure requirement. Furthermore, it should be noted that these are gross targets, meaning that the company does not include GHG removals, carbon credits, or avoided emissions among the means to achieve them. At all stages of its decision-making process, the Terna Group is committed to taking into account the opinions of its key stakeholders. This also applies when the Group’s targets are defined, including those for reducing GHG emissions. Indeed, the ongoing dialogue with stakeholders has enabled Terna to set the Group’s priorities in terms of climate change mitigation and adaption, has contributed to defining the related targets, and has supported the implementation of many initiatives aimed at combating climate change. For information on the business process for setting and updating the Group’s targets, monitoring the related performance and the engagement of employees, see the section ‘2024 - 2028 Sustainability Plan Update’. 103 See the section “Actions in relation to climate change” for information on the link between these emissions and the decarbonisation of Italy’s energy mix. 104 In the base year (2019), Scope 1 emissions in relation to total Scope 1 and Scope 2 were 4% and Scope 2 emissions were 96%.

These actions have been broken down by decarbonisation lever for a more effective understanding of the Group’s commitment to reducing emissions. In the future, the levers described earlier will contribute to achieving the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets set by Terna Group. Accordingly, their quantitative contribution is described below in terms of future emissions reduction.

Compared to past performance, in 2024, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions amounted to 1,351,212 tonnes of CO2e, down 26% from 2019, the target base year. Additional targets related to climate change In addition to the above-mentioned Science-based Target, Terna Group has set additional targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation that are part of its Sustainability Plan.

Consequently, an annual target in terms of percentage impact of such leakage with respect to the total installed has long been decided. In 2024, the performance was 0.41%. Furthermore, in line with Terna Group’s proactive management of climate change adaptation, the latest Sustainability Plan update - in line with the company’s resilience planning - involved the inclusion of targets and actions to improve the resilience of the grid. The target related to assets’ realization with the aim of improving NTG resilience against weather events is shown here. The target has been defined and presented for the first time in the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan update, integrated with the Industrial Plan. Therefore, 2024 is the base year to be considered for the definition of the targets. It is therefore necessary to wait for the 2025 final balance for a proper assessment of trends.

Direct energy consumption refers to fuel for the company’s operational vehicles (fleet vehicles and helicopters), for production activities and heating and for generators. Please note that a portion of the Group’s natural gas consumption is based on estimates that take into account values from the previous year (year n-1). With respect to indirect electricity consumption, as the companies operating in the electricity sector (transmission and dispatching of electricity) are unable to select a specific supplier, the disaggregation by source takes into account the national production mix transmitted via the electricity grid. For information on the disaggregation of the production mix, see the December 2024 issue of the “Monthly Report on the Electricity System” available on the website at www.terna.it. With respect to the remaining consumption attributable to the Group’s other subsidiaries (approximately 8% of total electricity consumption), the breakdown by source was based on the electricity bill or, in the absence thereof, on the energy mix of the relevant country. Direct energy consumption was converted into MWh from consumption in GigaJoules. To convert the volumes of the primary resources into gigajoules, the parameters set out in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocols were used (Reference Indicators IP Protocols). Furthermore, approximately 4% of the Group’s electricity consumption derives from estimates that take into account values for the year n-1. As mentioned earlier, grid losses are a physical effect caused by the loss of energy when electricity passes through conductors. They are calculated as the difference between energy injected by producers (including imported energy) and final consumption. Therefore, although the figures associated with grid losses are not - except for a small part - under Terna’s control (see page 240), in line with the GHG Protocol - an internationally recognised framework for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions - the CO2 emissions associated with this event are included in total indirect emissions (Scope 2, E1-6). Consequently, they are presented together with the other metrics in E1-5. The breakdown by source considers the national production mix transmitted via the electricity grid. The reference for the breakdown of the production mix is the December 2024 issue of the “Monthly Report on the Electricity System”, available on the website www.terna.it. Since grid losses depend mainly on end customers’ energy demand and consumption, it is noted that the leakage rate on the energy demand in Italy in 2024 is 1.8%. Ultimately, the Terna Group does not produce energy from fossil sources. The energy produced from renewable sources alone is for own consumption and amounts to 158 MWh.

With respect to electricity substations, the principal energy carriers are monitored, with measurements covering approximately 90% of the total consumption of the 24 sample electricity substations located across the country and selected according to climatic location, size and type of activity. Every year, additional transformer substations located across the country are included in the project, with overall consumption monitored on a quarter-hourly basis. The sensors installed on corporate sites send data to the EciWeb information system for deferred and/or online monitoring of energy-intensive elements (office buildings and electricity substation) relating to the high-voltage electricity transmission service. This information system is used to monitor and analyse electricity consumption in detail. In addition, 6 energy audits were carried out on Terna Group sites in 2024 in order to meet the requirements of the ISO 50001 standard. At Terna, the development of energy efficiency programmes relating to the use of electricity in substations and offices is experimental, as the Company’s electricity consumption falls within the category of “own transmission uses” which, according to the industry’s regulator, are not to be included in operating costs. With a view to improving energy performance, a number of offices have also been refurbished or are newly built under a long-term programme, which aims to upgrade the energy efficiency class of buildings owned by the Group. Proposed work at offices primarily regards improvements to the energy efficiency of lighting, air-conditioning and heating. The proposed changes at substations primarily regard the replacement of lighting towers and perimeter lighting with LED technology. The installation of sensors for online monitoring of energy consumption at corporate sites and the preparation of energy audits and energy efficiency actions take place annually.

Please note that the data used to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions all come from internal sources. In contrast, considering the data used for the Scope 3 calculation, as also detailed below, these primarily come from external sources. Scope 1 and 2: the conversion of direct energy consumption and leakages of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and refrigerant gases into equivalent CO2emissions has been carried out using the parameters indicated in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). The conversion of indirect electricity consumption was carried out taking into account the share of thermoelectric production in total Italian or foreign electricity production in 2024. Allocation for the purposes of the production mix is based on the 2024 issue of the “Monthly Report on the Electricity System” (available on the website at www.terna.it) for Italy and Enerdata for abroad. With respect to market-based emissions, contracts with sustainable option choice were identified for Brugg Kabel Services AG and some LT Group plants. In this respect, it is noted that companies in the electricity sector (providing electricity transmission and dispatching services) are unable to select a specific operator due to regulatory issues. Consequently, market-based emissions were measured considering the grid factor for all companies operating in the electricity transmission and dispatching sector. With respect to market-based emissions, in order to ensure comparability with location- based emissions, emissions related to grid losses have been included although they are specific to the electricity system and cannot, in any way, be considered in the same way as electricity consumption for which the Transmission System Operator can make a market-based choice. Therefore, the market-based value was calculated by considering the 99.7% of emissions for which the Terna Group is unable to make any market choices. Scope 3: The screening of Scope 3 categories showed that some of them were not significant for reporting purposes. This is either because their impact on total emissions is marginal or because they do not apply to the Group.

"192 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT The resilience of business to climate change Terna has developed an in-depth analysis of the resilience of its strategy and business model with respect to climate change, with an approach based on scientific data and advanced climate scenarios, which it updates annually as part of the preparation of its Resilience Plan. As outlined below, all major historical events related to physical risks have been analyzed. With reference to the main transition aspects considered, these are presented within the analyses described in the section ‘Focus | Climate Change’. At the systemic level, Terna publishes the annual Adequacy Report for Italy to analyse the impact of weather variability and climate change on the Italian electricity system. The element on which the Annual Adequacy Assessment for Italy focuses is the ability of the Italian electricity system, in the medium- and long-term (5 and 10 years, respectively), to ensure that the available resources, understood as the electricity generation plants, imports and storage, are sufficient to meet the hourly electricity demand in each electricity market zone of the country, while at the same time considering the impact of the first effects of climate change on the electricity system. The climate variables adopted in the adequacy assessments are in fact derived on the basis of historical data and appropriately updated to take into account climate change phenomena. At the operational level, the increase in the frequency of extreme weather events recorded in recent years in Italy makes it necessary to increase the resilience of the transmission grid. In fact, the increasing intensity of severe weather events closely linked to climate change means greater probability of significant damage to the country’s infrastructure, including electricity transmission equipment. Specifically, an analysis of the historical events in recent years that have affected the national transmission grid highlights the main factors causing disruptions: • formation of sleeves of wet snow on the lines, which weigh them down and cause short circuits or structural failures; • strong winds in particular regarding the consequence of falling plants and trees; • floods, landslides, landslips, tornadoes and other extreme phenomena that may cause short circuits or the collapse of pylons or other structural failures; • the increase in pollutant deposits linked to prolonged periods of drought (such as saline pollution) which cause a greater likelihood of surface discharge; • forest fires, also triggered by high temperatures that can directly affect assets causing failures or requiring them to be taken out of service to facilitate extinguishing activities. It is therefore crucial for Terna Group to identify the areas where grid infrastructure is most exposed to such events and to intervene with effective and efficient capital expenditure to prevent and mitigate outages. The electricity grid must be able to withstand increasing stresses and, in the event of disruptions, interventions and tools must be put in place to manage the emergency, quickly restoring normal operating conditions. To support the process of planning interventions to increase resilience there is the Resilience Methodology (Appendix A76 of the Grid Code), which is characterised by three key elements: • development of forecast climate scenarios to identify the areas of the territory most exposed to the effects of severe weather events of various kinds, associating with them their relative likelihood of occurrence; • estimating the vulnerability of power line components to direct and indirect stresses caused by severe weather events, through the determination of specific vulnerability curves defined using real technical-orographic parameters; >> continued FOCUS Climate Change OTHER DOCUMENTS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT ON OPERATIONS"

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business • “n-k” probabilistic approach for the analysis of multiple and simultaneous outages produced by weather events, in order to be able to quantify the probability of occurrence of such multiple contingencies and assess their impact on the portion of the electricity system exposed to the severe weather event. More specifically, the Resilience Methodology consists of six main steps: 1. analysis of exposure to severe weather events: assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of weather phenomena according to predefined intensity thresholds, based on advanced climate models. 2. infrastructure vulnerability analysis: assessment of the vulnerability of high-voltage lines to direct and indirect stresses of weather events through the development of specific vulnerability curves. 3. calculation of the return time of line failure before intervention: determination of the probability of grid failure in the absence of intervention by combining climate-related data and vulnerability curves. 4. calculation of the outage return time and the risk of expected energy not-supplied before intervention: application of a contingency analysis algorithm to quantify the risk of simultaneous outages of several grid elements using a probabilistic approach. 5. calculation of the return time of line failure and the risk of expected energy not-supplied after intervention: assessment of the effectiveness of grid reinforcement interventions in reducing vulnerability to extreme weather events. 6. calculation of the benefit for increasing resilience: determination of the improvement of the grid by comparing the expected energy not-supplied before and after the planned measures. Over the course of these years, the Resilience Methodology, initially developed for assessments of snow and high- wind weather events, has undergone continuous change and has been refined in order to improve the modelling of multifaceted phenomena such as meteorological and climate-related phenomena, in the light of climate change, and to assess the contribution of new technological solutions that provide a benefit in terms of resilience. To this end, collaboration with research institutes and universities such as RSE - Ricerca sul Sistema Elettrico and the Polytechnic Institute in Milan plays a key role. Furthermore, analyses of meteorological and climate-related phenomena associated with hydrogeological instability are underway with the aim of identifying the type of events potentially with the greatest impact on the National Transmission Grid (NTG) and introducing their modelling within the Resilience Methodology. Through the application of Resilience Methodology, it is, therefore, possible to implement effective and efficient planning of interventions to increase grid resilience. In this regard, measures to increase grid resilience may be classified into the following four categories: • preventive measures, aimed at increasing grid meshing, improving the reliability and robustness of existing assets, reducing exposure to potentially impactful weather threats or involving the reconstruction of portions of existing infrastructure; • mitigation measures to contain the risks on the electricity system and reduce the damage of the critical event; • restoration measures, aimed at reducing the time to restore service and/or outages following the occurrence of adverse weather events impacting the electricity system. This category includes all measures to reduce the time of disruption and return the electricity system to normal operation;"
"194 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT • monitoring actions to support both preventive and restoration activities. These measures are described, on an annual basis, in the Resilience Plan, a transversal corporate plan that defines all initiatives aimed at preventing and/or reducing damage to the electricity grid caused by increasingly severe weather events in terms of intensity and frequency. As mentioned above, the resilience analysis is continuously evolving, and for this reason, further assessments are underway, such as the analysis of the meteorological and climatic phenomena mentioned earlier. What has been described so far and is outlined below forms the basis for the development of the aforementioned plan, aimed at ensuring the resilience and security of the Terna Group’s infrastructure, as well as providing a reliable and uninterrupted service. In particular, the Resilience Plan includes preventive infrastructural actions to increase resilience to snow and wind, identified with the Resilience Methodology, but also actions in the Development Plan and/or in the Connections Annex that, assessed with the new methodology, are able to reduce the risks of outages during such events. Another innovative infrastructural solution is represented by tower manoeuvring devices (Organi di Manovra su Palo - OMP), a technology conceived at Terna and patented, which consists in equipping the lattice towers that characterise NTG lines of manoeuvring systems, making it possible to increase the resilience and flexibility of operation of portions of the grid with reduced meshing, while also representing a solution with reduced visual and environmental impact. Preventive measures, again related to resilience, also include actions related to the ‘Renewal Plan’, such as reinforcing power lines and cutting down plants and trees, to prevent disruptions related to tree interference on power lines following, for example, high-wind events. Also included in the Resilience Plan are all initiatives related to the Security Plan (of which it is an annex) aimed at mitigating the effects on the grid caused in particular by snow events, such as anti-rotation devices and interphase spacers, and the adoption of technological solutions and tools to monitor the grid, prevent the occurrence of severe events, and speed up service resumption. Finally, the Resilience Plan also includes initiatives to increase resilience for other types of events such as saline and air pollution and fire risk. These are also included in the Security Plan. The Resilience Plan 2024 also expands the portfolio of initiatives to increase the resilience of the NTG through the support of digitalisation, envisaging the use of IoT techniques aimed at the widespread collection of information on the assets and which, together with complex calculation algorithms, guarantee the optimal and resilient operation of the electricity system. Additional support to the capital expenditure for the security and resilience of the NTG comes in the form of public funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and the related revision with the REPowerEU chapter, in relation to which the Group was awarded €150 million for the NRRP and €140 million for the REPowerEU, with the objective, on the one hand, of increasing the resilience of 1,500 km of NTG lines for severe weather events and, on the other hand, to start the digitalisation the NTG, ensuring safe and resilient operation. It should be noted that the Resilience Plan is an annex to the broader Defence Plan for the Security of the National Electricity System (Security Plan) that Terna prepares annually.

"196 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Protecting biodiversity The interaction of the Group’s activities with biodiversity is mainly related to the physical presence of power lines and electricity substations78 and their impact on the surrounding environment, which can be both natural and man-made. In particular, with reference to the construction phase of the works, great attention is paid to the choice of areas and access tracks, selected, when possible, in areas of lesser natural value. In the case of submarine power lines, the impacts concern the integrity of the seabed on which the undersea cables are laid. Regarding laying and maintenance operations, the impacts primarily concern aquatic flora species such as, for example, Posidonia oceanica. In this context, the search for the route constitutes the most delicate design phase as it determines the future impact on the environment and biodiversity of the entire development project. For this reason, Terna, without prejudice to the need to identify a route that allows for the regular operation and maintenance of the power line, seeks design solutions that minimise the amount of land used, interference with areas of environmental, natural, landscape, and archaeological value whether urbanised or urban development areas, and the encumbrances on the properties involved79. The support of the GIS technology (‘Geographic Information System’), is fundamental when searching for sustainable locations (corridors) for National Transmission Grid (NTG) development projects. This technology allows comprehensive consideration of all information relating to the different types of land use and protection obligations (territorial, naturalistic, cultural, landscape, etc.), in order to identify possible locations which are the most compatible with the area concerned. The interaction between Terna lines and substations and protected areas or areas of natural interest is constantly monitored. Therefore, all of the Group’s assets are assessed with the support of GIS technology, and overall, monitoring includes all substations (915 in 2024) and power lines (68,374 km in 2024). With the support of this database, it has been carried out an inventory of possible interferences between assets and protected area or areas of high biodiversity, cross-referencing data on the electricity grid with local data. (in 2024, there were 7,276.24 km of power lines and 34 electricity substations interfering with protected areas; for more details, see the tables on page 259, in the context of paragraph “Metrics related to biodiversity protection”). Considering that interventions in protected areas are reduced to a minimum by virtue of the application of ERPA procedures, the mitigation measures required by legislation and ordered by local authorities are applied for new works. The Double Materiality Assessment 2024 identified and considered the impacts that may collectively concern the Group’s activities with respect to biodiversity, it was not deemed necessary to break down the impacts by specific sites. This detail is carried out following the requirements and environmental impact assessment for the implementation of the Development Plan. The Double Materiality Assessment considered the direct and indirect impacts of Terna’s activities on biodiversity and ecosystems, assessing both actual and potential impacts. Starting from an analysis of internal and external corporate documents, also considering sector-specific guidelines of the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a series of impacts related to the topics and sub-topics indicated by the ESRS standards were then identified. The identified impacts were submitted to the relevant corporate functions and external sustainability experts, who assessed their materiality based on the criteria of significance and likelihood. The contribution of the functions involved in the context of the Double Materiality Assessment is of particular importance since they are responsible for ensuring ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders as a fundamental element of the preparatory activities for updating and implementing the Development Plan. The Group is constantly committed to establishing and implementing the most efficient forms of engagement and participatory planning, with particular FOCUS 78 For a list of sites, see the tables ‘Details of power lines owned by the Terna Group’ and ‘Details of electricity substations owned by the Terna Group’ on page 388. 79 Terna’s planning includes the study of site plans aimed at using existing roads or tracks to minimise the opening of new tracks, especially in wooded or protected areas, and the assessment of problems related to cutting vegetation, adopting methodologies and tools to minimise interference such as optimising the height of supports and their location. Agreement on location criteria is the instrument used for selecting local corridors with least impact. These criteria are used to identify the greater or lesser degree of suitability of an area to host new electricity infrastructure. Terna and the Regions have agreed on a system of ERPA criteria (Exclusion; Repulsion; Problems; Attraction), based on four classes, to be adopted when locating new electrical works. Protected areas, including the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) categories that coincide with these, fall into the ‘Repulsion’ category, which binds Terna not to operate unless there are no alternatives or there are only alternatives that are even less environmentally compatible.

These actions have been broken down by decarbonisation lever for a more effective understanding of the Group’s commitment to reducing emissions. In the future, the levers described earlier will contribute to achieving the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets set by Terna Group. Accordingly, their quantitative contribution is described below in terms of future emissions reduction.

Compared to past performance, in 2024, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions amounted to 1,351,212 tonnes of CO2e, down 26% from 2019, the target base year. Additional targets related to climate change In addition to the above-mentioned Science-based Target, Terna Group has set additional targets related to climate change mitigation and adaptation that are part of its Sustainability Plan. The most significant ones are shown below. OBJECTIVE TARGET BOUNDARY METRIC AND RELATED UNIT OF MEASUREMENT MILESTONE 2025 2026 2027 2028 SF6 leakage rate on total installed as a percentage.

Consequently, an annual target in terms of percentage impact of such leakage with respect to the total installed has long been decided. In 2024, the performance was 0.41%. Furthermore, in line with Terna Group’s proactive management of climate change adaptation, the latest Sustainability Plan update - in line with the company’s resilience planning - involved the inclusion of targets and actions to improve the resilience of the grid. The target related to assets’ realization with the aim of improving NTG resilience against weather events is shown here. The target has been defined and presented for the first time in the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan update, integrated with the Industrial Plan. Therefore, 2024 is the base year to be considered for the definition of the targets. It is therefore necessary to wait for the 2025 final balance for a proper assessment of trends. More information on the Sustainability Plan and its monitoring is available in the relevant section."

Direct energy consumption refers to fuel for the company’s operational vehicles (fleet vehicles and helicopters), for production activities and heating and for generators. Please note that a portion of the Group’s natural gas consumption is based on estimates that take into account values from the previous year (year n-1). With respect to indirect electricity consumption, as the companies operating in the electricity sector (transmission and dispatching of electricity) are unable to select a specific supplier, the disaggregation by source takes into account the national production mix transmitted via the electricity grid. For information on the disaggregation of the production mix, see the December 2024 issue of the “Monthly Report on the Electricity System” available on the website at www.terna.it. With respect to the remaining consumption attributable to the Group’s other subsidiaries (approximately 8% of total electricity consumption), the breakdown by source was based on the electricity bill or, in the absence thereof, on the energy mix of the relevant country. Direct energy consumption was converted into MWh from consumption in GigaJoules. To convert the volumes of the primary resources into gigajoules, the parameters set out in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) protocols were used (Reference Indicators IP Protocols). Furthermore, approximately 4% of the Group’s electricity consumption derives from estimates that take into account values for the year n-1. As mentioned earlier, grid losses are a physical effect caused by the loss of energy when electricity passes through conductors. They are calculated as the difference between energy injected by producers (including imported energy) and final consumption. Therefore, although the figures associated with grid losses are not - except for a small part - under Terna’s control (see page 240), in line with the GHG Protocol - an internationally recognised framework for measuring and managing greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) emissions - the CO2 emissions associated with this event are included in total indirect emissions (Scope 2, E1-6). Consequently, they are presented together with the other metrics in E1-5. The breakdown by source considers the national production mix transmitted via the electricity grid. The reference for the breakdown of the production mix is the December 2024 issue of the “Monthly Report on the Electricity System”, available on the website www.terna.it. Since grid losses depend mainly on end customers’ energy demand and consumption, it is noted that the leakage rate on the energy demand in Italy in 2024 is 1.8%. Ultimately, the Terna Group does not produce energy from fossil sources. The energy produced from renewable sources alone is for own consumption and amounts to 158 MWh.

Please note that the data used to calculate Scope 1 and 2 emissions all come from internal sources. In contrast, considering the data used for the Scope 3 calculation, as also detailed below, these primarily come from external sources. Scope 1 and 2: the conversion of direct energy consumption and leakages of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) and refrigerant gases into equivalent CO2emissions has been carried out using the parameters indicated in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). The conversion of indirect electricity consumption was carried out taking into account the share of thermoelectric production in total Italian or foreign electricity production in 2024. Allocation for the purposes of the production mix is based on the 2024 issue of the “Monthly Report on the Electricity System” (available on the website at www.terna.it) for Italy and Enerdata for abroad. With respect to market-based emissions, contracts with sustainable option choice were identified for Brugg Kabel Services AG and some LT Group plants. In this respect, it is noted that companies in the electricity sector (providing electricity transmission and dispatching services) are unable to select a specific operator due to regulatory issues. Consequently, market-based emissions were measured considering the grid factor for all companies operating in the electricity transmission and dispatching sector. With respect to market-based emissions, in order to ensure comparability with location- based emissions, emissions related to grid losses have been included although they are specific to the electricity system and cannot, in any way, be considered in the same way as electricity consumption for which the Transmission System Operator can make a market-based choice. Therefore, the market-based value was calculated by considering the 99.7% of emissions for which the Terna Group is unable to make any market choices. Scope 3: The screening of Scope 3 categories showed that some of them were not significant for reporting purposes. This is either because their impact on total emissions is marginal or because they do not apply to the Group. The following categories were not included in the calculation: Category 8 - Upstream leased assets; Category 10 - Processing of sold products; Category 13 - Downstream leased assets; Category 14 - Franchises.

With respect to inputs, the consumption of fuel, refrigerant gases, electricity and grid losses (used for Scope 1 and 2 calculation purposes) is collected and entered into the Excel tool to calculate the GHG inventory. The calculation method involves multiplying the physical-based data by the well-to-tank emission factor, which is used to estimate emissions from energy consumption not included in Scope 1 and 2. Emission factors are taken from the Defra database. These are well-to-tank factors specific to each type of fuel used, as well as to the electricity and refrigerant gases consumed by the company.

Similarly to categories 1 and 2, inputs on the kilometres of power lines and the number of substations built in 2024 are collected and subsequently entered into the LCA Tool and processed in another Excel file. The final calculation is the sum of emissions arising from the transport of materials and machines during the installation phase. For the Tamini Group and the LT Group, a spend-based approach is used whereby the spend-based figure is multiplied by the emission factor of the relevant service category. Emission factors are taken from the Ecoinvent and EPA databases. With respect to the Brugg Group, for items expressed in weight and for which the average-method is therefore used, transport- related impacts are included in category 1, as the Ecoinvent emission factors already consider the impact of the transport of purchased materials. For a few materials relating to Brugg Switzerland, for which the figure in kg is not available, the spend-based figure was considered. Assuming that 5% of the cost of the material represents the transport cost, the service-related impact was calculated using EPA factors. Category 5: For Terna, Terna Rete Italia, Terna Plus and Terna Energy Solutions, the LCA method is used. Similarly to categories 1, 2 and 4, inputs on the kilometres of power lines and the number of substations built during the year are collected and subsequently entered into the LCA Tool and processed in another Excel file. The final calculation is the sum of the emissions arising from the transport and disposal of waste soil at the landfill site and of those arising from the end-of-life of foundation, insulation and reinforcement works, cables and components, trenches and joint holes, etc. (some parts are sent for recycling and others to landfill). For the Brugg Group, Tamini Group, LT Group and Terna Crna Gora, a waste-type-specific method is used, whereby the kg or tonnes of waste is multiplied by the emission factor related to the type of waste and disposal or recovery method. Emission factors are taken from the Ecoinvent and Defra database. Category 6: For Terna S.p.A; Terna Rete Italia S.p.A; Rete S.r.l.; Terna Energy Solutions S.r.l., emissions are calculated by the Travel Manager. The travel agency directly provided the CO2 emissions generated by employees’ air and train travel. For the Brugg Group, Tamini Group, LT Group, Avvenia and Terna Crna Gora, a distance-based method is applied, which considers the distance in kilometres travelled during the journey and the means of transport used. The inputs comprise the kilometres travelled, the means of transport, the travel class and the number of employees. The calculation method involves multiplying the figure in kilometres by the emission factor specific to the means of transport. The emission factors used are taken from the Defra database. Category 7: The calculation of this category considers the estimated number of employees of the Terna Group. Therefore, Quantis’ Scope 3 Evaluator tool is used, which matches number of employees to a total value of emissions related to employee commuting. Category 9: For the Brugg Group, the Tamini Group and the LT Group, a distance-based approach is adopted, which takes into account the kilometres travelled from the offices of the units to the countries where sales were made. The calculation method involves multiplying the kilograms transported by the number of kilometres travelled by the emission factor for the average transport of one kilogram of material. Emission factors are taken from the Ecoinvent database. Category 11: For the Brugg Group and the Tamini Group, the calculation methodology envisages a physical-based approach. This category estimates the Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions associated with the use of the product throughout its useful life. The calculation method involves multiplying the physical-based data by the emission factor of fuel and electricity, all multiplied by the years of the product’s life. For Brugg Kable Services AG, the products sold considered comprise metres of cable, broken down by year and geographical area. The energy consumption related to the use of cables consists of the related grid losses. Grid losses per kilometre were estimated based on Terna’s (GWh/km). For Tamini, the grid losses associated with transformers were calculated, in the countries where they were sold, based on a certified LCA of one transformer and the average characteristics of all transformers sold. Emission factors on the energy mixes of the various countries included in the Enerdata database are considered. These emission factors were subsequently applied to the useful life of cables and transformers based on the WEO’s SDS and STEPS projection scenarios. Category 12: For the Brugg Group and the Tamini Group, the calculation methodology applies a waste-type-specific method whereby the physical- based input is multiplied by the disposal-related emission factor. The physical-based input reflects, for each year, the metres of cable for the Brugg Group and the number of transformers sold for the Tamini Group. To obtain an estimation of tCO2e/km, the inputs from corporate LCA tool are considered, which provide a break-down of the emissions arising from cable disposal. This factor was subsequently applied to the kilometres of cable sold by Brugg Kable Services AG. For Tamini, the certified LCA provided for a transformer is used. Category 15: For the first year, the emissions in this category have been calculated considering Terna Forward’s corporate venture capital investments. The inputs refer to 2023 (certified inputs). The calculation of emissions is based on the average-data method, in line with the GHG Protocol. This method multiplies the total revenue of each investee by the corresponding emission factor of the relevant economic sector. The resulting value is subsequently weighted according to the percentage of investments held by Terna Forward. Revenue expressed in dollars has been translated into euros using the appropriate exchange rate. Emission factors are taken from the EPA database. Emission intensity based on net revenue EMISSION INTENSITY PER NET REVENUE U.M. 2024 Total emissions (location-based) per net revenue tCO2e/€ 0.000863 Total emissions (market-based) per net revenue 0.000863 The net revenue used to calculate emission intensity amounts to €3,616.2 million. This amount matches the balance of “Revenue from sales and services” in the consolidated financial statements.

These policies are defined in compliance with applicable regulations and reference best practices, and periodically updated, taking into account changes in the scenario and instances that emerge from the engagement activities conducted with the Group’s stakeholders, such as the dialogue initiatives set up for the purpose of the double materiality process, in order to ensure that they can represent a valid tool to steer the Group’s activities in terms of protection of biodiversity and affected ecosystems. The Group’s policies are also shared with and disseminated to stakeholders through specific communication activities differentiated according to the stakeholders, such as, for instance, the posting on the Group’s website or other types of documents where deemed necessary. The Terna Group’s guidelines on the protection biodiversity are specifically formalised in various documents, as described below. Terna Group’s Integrated Management System Policy In line with the principles of the Code of Ethics and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Terna Group has adopted the Integrated Management System Policy - which is approved by Terna’s Board of Directors - in which the company’s CEO and General Manager also take part, and the guidelines issued are valid for all company processes and activities. This is a guiding tool for defining strategic objectives, which complies with the requirements of the ISO standards and is aligned with the organisational context. It is therefore the responsibility of the entire management to implement these guidelines. Monitoring of the implementation of the Policy is carried out annually through the Integrated Management System Review and through annual Audits by the Certification Body (Third Party). Specifically, the Policy addresses, inter alia, biodiversity. With respect to the guidelines to oversee the Environmental Management System, in compliance with the UNI EN ISO 14001 standard and the impacts and opportunities identified following the double materiality assessment, the Terna Group undertakes to: • check the appropriateness of the context in which the Terna Group operates; • prepare a periodic assessment of the compliance obligations applicable to the Terna Group; • prepare a periodic assessment of the risks/opportunities and environmental impacts of its activities and related risks, seeking solutions to minimise any negative effects of its activities on the environment, considering the entire life cycle of its works; 105 In line with the results of the update of the double materiality assessment, it is noted that the disclosure provided in the paragraph “Protection of biodiversity” refers to electricity transmission and dispatching activities.

"250 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Finally, the document sets out the following objectives: • reconciling grid development and maintenance with the respect for biodiversity; • draw up a Biodiversity Action Plan and, in particular, a Birdlife Protection Plan, to define priorities for action and increase the effectiveness in protecting biodiversity; • increase the availability to the public - in particular to the scientific community - of the environmental studies and monitoring carried out on its electricity infrastructure, e.g. studies about environmental impact assessments and implementation of the requirements imposed by the public authorities. The Terna Group discloses this commitment to all internal and external stakeholders in a specific section of its corporate website. Furthermore, the principles set out in the Integrated Policy are disseminated among employees as part of internal training initiatives. Strategic Environmental Assessment of the national transmission grid Development Plan Terna Group’s attention to the protection of biodiversity is embodied in its commitment to minimising its impact on biodiversity, by promoting the principle of “No Net Loss” of biodiversity and, where applicable and possible, the principle of “Net Gain”, and via the rigorous application of the four stages of the mitigation hierarchy. Since the early planning and design stages, location solutions are sought to avoid and prevent negative impacts on biodiversity; if potential impacts are unavoidable, appropriate minimisation and rehabilitation/restoration measures are identified in the various design stages and, ultimately, an analysis to offset the residual impacts is carried out. Since 2002, inspired by the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and the principles of sustainability and bringing forward the transposition of the European Directive into Italian legislation, the Terna Group has embarked on a voluntary joint path with the Ministries and the Regions by organising, in collaboration with the competent Ministries, working tables with the Regions on environmental analysis methodologies and impact assessment indicators. The Terna Group has introduced the ERPA (Exclusion, Repulsion, Complexity and Attraction) criteria into its Strategic Environmental Assessment. This is a national automated procedure. Following the above analyses, the most suitable areas are identified by conducting a thorough feasibility analysis, supported by specific in-depth studies, field surveys and evaluation of possible critical issues. The Department of Grid Development and Dispatching Strategies - Electricity System Planning and Authorisation (SSD-PSE) and Project Development (SSD-SVP) is responsible for approving and monitoring the policy. This policy applies to Terna Group companies. Specifically, the departments/structures mainly involved are those of Terna S.p.A. and Terna Rete Italia. As part of project development activities, the Unit in charge of Local Analyses and Theme-based Controls operates to ensure the preparation of technical-environmental analyses aimed at locating land structures, guaranteeing their environmental sustainability, in accordance with environmental policies and studies for the relevant infrastructure. In addition, for non-submarine components, it ensures theme-based controls in the field of vegetation, wildlife and biodiversity.

"254 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Actions related to the protection of biodiversity At all stages of its activities, the Terna Group adopts strategies that ensure the balanced integration of the infrastructure into the local area, respecting its cultural and landscape characteristics, while promoting the protection of ecosystems and biodiversity and acknowledging the positive impact of the latter in the provision of ecosystem services. With respect to ecosystem conservation, the Company restores habitats, masks substations with native species selected on the basis of studies of actual and potential vegetation compared to the context, and improves environmental connections. In particular, in the case of sites of low naturalistic value (agricultural contexts), it improves their environmental conditions. By actively cooperating with third-party organisations, the Terna Group develops projects that safeguard habitats, in addition to constantly monitor the environmental status of sites over time, thereby ensuring that the area’s ecosystem services are maintained. Indeed, in 2024, it launched, or pursued, many initiatives to achieve the objectives of biodiversity and ecosystem protection policies aimed at mitigating and reducing its impacts, as well as seizing material opportunities. The following list shows the actions and their contribution, as mentioned earlier, to achieving the objectives set by the Group’s policies in terms of biodiversity and ecosystems. Design of projects for newly built supports As part of biodiversity protection and the conservation of agro-ecosystems, the Terna Group is preparing a document containing guidelines on the design of projects aimed at increasing biodiversity for new supports in agricultural/ natural areas. This document covers planned actions in Italy that include specific measures designed to promote the restoration of environmental balances, while improving the resilience of ecosystems in agricultural contexts. The frequency of the actions will depend on the progress of the design and implementation of the works. Green engineering projects involving electricity substations The Terna Group designs and builds new electricity substations in Italy, fostering an interaction with the landscape and ensuring sustainable synergy with the local context. Specifically, in order to preserve biodiversity, enhancement measures are implemented, including the use of green engineering techniques. These projects, especially when included in contexts with a low natural character, contribute to a significant improvement in biodiversity, both in terms of vegetation and wildlife. Post-construction maintenance activities which maintain the environmental functions of the area involved also play an essential role. The years of maintenance activities may vary depending on the type of action. Consequently, when used as an indicator, they are always shown/reported/explained in the related contracts, as confirmed by the activities carried out in 2024. Planning activities for the development of Biodotti The development of Biodotti was planned in 2024 as part of a project launched in 2022. This project includes renaturation activities at the base of power line supports in order to increase biodiversity, improve the environmental connection in fragmented habitats by planting native species and implementing installations for wildlife. It has a medium- to long-term future time frame. Accordingly, Terna Group’s power lines become genuine stepping stones that facilitate the movement of wildlife between natural areas, contributing to the enhancement of biodiversity. In particular, the Terna Group completed a pilot project in Lombardy, Tuscany and Sicily which involved a total of 17 supports in agricultural areas and 5 overhead power lines that can now act as an environmental link between areas of greater natural characteristics.

This methodology was developed in 2022 and will continue in 2025 in order to monitor and assess, site by site, how the environmental status changes and a Dynamic Indicator that measures this change over time for each individual site, whilst also providing a global indication of the changes taking place at all the sites in general. The entomofauna survey carried out in 2024 covered 8 sites located in Lombardy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche, Emilia-Romagna and Sardinia, where 12,644 beetles were sampled, broken down into 81 families, in accordance with the taxonomic classification of Coleoptera families of the checklist of Italy’s wildlife, with a few modifications. The sampling method involved two sampling sessions during the period of greatest entomofauna activity, with a sampling interval of 20 days. For the eight sites, two sampling stations were identified: one within the test area and another in the external control area. The collected material was analysed in the laboratory, the samples identified at family and trophic-functional group level and entered into the database. The Tiny Forest project Five actions of the Tiny Forest project have been carried out since 2022, in collaboration with the Italian Botanical Company in Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio (2) and Campania. The aim of the project is to create natural habitats to increase biodiversity, by adopting Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki’s innovative forestry method of creating tiny forests with a high density of native species. This approach facilitates rapid plant growth, the development of self-sufficient ecosystems and increased capacity of CO2 absorption. Environmental monitoring for marine cable laying As part of marine cable laying activities (before, during and after), the water column, sediment, benthic community and seabed components were subject to marine environmental monitoring in 2024, in order to describe and assess the interaction between cables and the related environment. The surveys will be repeated annually to enable the analysis and comparison of biological, chemical, physical and geophysical parameters over time."
"256 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Biodiversity offsets in Terna Group projects The Terna Group uses biodiversity offsetting techniques. Below is a list of the types of actions included in its action plans: Habitat reconstruction projects carried out in Italy, which may involve areas with newly built and/or demolished supports, electricity substations and construction sites. The relevant design criteria are based on the principles and methods of naturalistic silviculture, which entails the exclusive use of native species, selected in line with the existing vegetation and the environmental conditions of the site, in order to obtain the highest possible level of biodiversity and phytosociological consistency with the surrounding areas. A twofold aim was pursued when selecting revegetation techniques: restore the stages of the dynamic series of the site’s potential natural vegetation and, at the same time, guarantee anti-erosive and soil protection functions while limiting colonisation by invasive alien species by grassing all the areas affected by the works. Different types of action are planned and implemented based on the characteristics of the affected area, adopting those that are most suitable for the environmental context. Post-construction maintenance activities which maintain the environmental functions of the area involved also play an essential role. The years of maintenance activities may vary depending on the type of action. Consequently, when used as an indicator, they are always shown/reported/explained in the related contracts. These offsetting projects are currently being planned and designed. Consequently, the quantification of the future resources to be allocated to this activity is currently in progress. Compared to 2024, no direct costs were incurred in this respect. Transplanting olive trees: transplanting protected tree species, such as olive trees, is a key environmental offsetting technique adopted by the Terna Group. This action is necessary when the site of a converter station is in an area with olive trees, thereby ensuring the preservation of these valuable plants and safeguarding local biodiversity. Through a careful uprooting and replanting process, defined with the support of specialised agronomists, olive trees are transplanted using techniques that favour their adaptation and growth. Each phase of the project, from pruning to relocation, is designed to ensure the vegetative recovery of the trees, thereby contributing to the preservation of the landscape and the protection of biodiversity. The monetary effects of this biodiversity offsetting activity include capital expenditure of approximately €1,979,100, recognised in the consolidated financial statements item “Property, plant and equipment”. Transplanting Posidonia oceanic meadows is an environmental offsetting technique used by the Terna Group to restore sea meadows crossed by submarine cables. This aquatic plant, which the European directives defined as a priority habitat to be preserved, plays an essential role in the marine ecosystem as it protects the coastline from erosion and provides shelter and food for numerous organisms. In order to ensure the protection of biodiversity, the Terna Group transplants and relocates Posidonia oceanica meadows before laying the submarine cable. Each project is carried out by highly experienced and qualified personnel, using consolidated techniques to ensure the highest standards of environmental sustainability. Upon completion of the transplant, a conservation and environmental monitoring plan is implemented in order to follow the evolution over time of the volume of Posidonia oceanica meadows in the transplanted areas and the condition of the plant and the surrounding environment. These offsetting projects are currently being planned and designed. Consequently, the quantification of the future resources to be allocated to this activity is currently in progress. Compared to 2024, no direct costs were incurred in this respect. OTHER DOCUMENTS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT ON OPERATIONS"

In 2024, 69.6 km of obsolete overhead lines were removed. This target was not met due to postponements. Some demolitions have been postponed until 2025 or later, pending the completion of the necessary works. It should be noted that the number of biodiversity enhancement interventions on existing supports was 17 in 2024, a year for which no target value had been set. The above targets were processed and represented, for the first time, in the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the first integrated with the Industrial Plan. The base year to be considered for the formulation of the targets is therefore, as a rule, 2024. It is therefore necessary to wait for the 2025 final balance for a proper assessment of trends. The updated Sustainability Plan, whose guidelines were shared at the Sustainability Governance and Scenarios Board Committee and also represented within the Industrial Plan document submitted to the board of directors, did not require any particular changes in terms of metrics or methodologies for these objectives. The targets related to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems also show the Group’s broader approach to this topic covered by the relevant Policies. Indeed, the Biodotti project and the removal of obsolete overhead lines are in line with the principles of No net loss of biodiversity and, where possible, Net improvement, and are consistent with the mitigation hierarchy, on which the Biodiversity Commitment, the Integrated Management System Policy and the Development Plan’s Strategic Environmental Assessment Guideline are based. As part of the definition of targets and initiatives, the priorities identified by the double materiality and environmental assessment carried out in order to maintain the ISO 14001 certification were considered. No further specific ecological thresholds were considered. In this respect, developments are possible based on the Group’s path towards the adoption of a Science-based Target for Nature (included in the targets of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan) in line with the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) methodology. Furthermore, the SBTN methodology provides a framework that is consistent with global and regional biodiversity policies and regulations, such as those established by COP15 and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which enable companies to set scientifically sound and measurable biodiversity targets. In order to achieve this target, in 2024, the first phase of the preparatory activities envisaged in the methodology was completed, with the adoption of a 2026 target as a milestone. This activity sets a target based on a certified scientific methodology to minimise the Group’s impacts in terms of changes to biodiversity. Biodiversity-related targets are linked to the impacts identified as part of the double materiality assessment and are also tools for mitigating changes to biodiversity and enhancing the positive effects related to the initiatives undertaken by the Group.

This methodology was developed in 2022 and will continue in 2025 in order to monitor and assess, site by site, how the environmental status changes and a Dynamic Indicator that measures this change over time for each individual site, whilst also providing a global indication of the changes taking place at all the sites in general. The entomofauna survey carried out in 2024 covered 8 sites located in Lombardy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Marche, Emilia-Romagna and Sardinia, where 12,644 beetles were sampled, broken down into 81 families, in accordance with the taxonomic classification of Coleoptera families of the checklist of Italy’s wildlife, with a few modifications. The sampling method involved two sampling sessions during the period of greatest entomofauna activity, with a sampling interval of 20 days. For the eight sites, two sampling stations were identified: one within the test area and another in the external control area. The collected material was analysed in the laboratory, the samples identified at family and trophic-functional group level and entered into the database. The Tiny Forest project Five actions of the Tiny Forest project have been carried out since 2022, in collaboration with the Italian Botanical Company in Lombardy, Veneto, Lazio (2) and Campania. The aim of the project is to create natural habitats to increase biodiversity, by adopting Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki’s innovative forestry method of creating tiny forests with a high density of native species. This approach facilitates rapid plant growth, the development of self-sufficient ecosystems and increased capacity of CO2 absorption. Environmental monitoring for marine cable laying As part of marine cable laying activities (before, during and after), the water column, sediment, benthic community and seabed components were subject to marine environmental monitoring in 2024, in order to describe and assess the interaction between cables and the related environment. The surveys will be repeated annually to enable the analysis and comparison of biological, chemical, physical and geophysical parameters over time."
"256 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Biodiversity offsets in Terna Group projects The Terna Group uses biodiversity offsetting techniques. Below is a list of the types of actions included in its action plans: Habitat reconstruction projects carried out in Italy, which may involve areas with newly built and/or demolished supports, electricity substations and construction sites. The relevant design criteria are based on the principles and methods of naturalistic silviculture, which entails the exclusive use of native species, selected in line with the existing vegetation and the environmental conditions of the site, in order to obtain the highest possible level of biodiversity and phytosociological consistency with the surrounding areas. A twofold aim was pursued when selecting revegetation techniques: restore the stages of the dynamic series of the site’s potential natural vegetation and, at the same time, guarantee anti-erosive and soil protection functions while limiting colonisation by invasive alien species by grassing all the areas affected by the works. Different types of action are planned and implemented based on the characteristics of the affected area, adopting those that are most suitable for the environmental context. Post-construction maintenance activities which maintain the environmental functions of the area involved also play an essential role. The years of maintenance activities may vary depending on the type of action. Consequently, when used as an indicator, they are always shown/reported/explained in the related contracts. These offsetting projects are currently being planned and designed. Consequently, the quantification of the future resources to be allocated to this activity is currently in progress. Compared to 2024, no direct costs were incurred in this respect. Transplanting olive trees: transplanting protected tree species, such as olive trees, is a key environmental offsetting technique adopted by the Terna Group. This action is necessary when the site of a converter station is in an area with olive trees, thereby ensuring the preservation of these valuable plants and safeguarding local biodiversity. Through a careful uprooting and replanting process, defined with the support of specialised agronomists, olive trees are transplanted using techniques that favour their adaptation and growth. Each phase of the project, from pruning to relocation, is designed to ensure the vegetative recovery of the trees, thereby contributing to the preservation of the landscape and the protection of biodiversity. The monetary effects of this biodiversity offsetting activity include capital expenditure of approximately €1,979,100, recognised in the consolidated financial statements item “Property, plant and equipment”. Transplanting Posidonia oceanic meadows is an environmental offsetting technique used by the Terna Group to restore sea meadows crossed by submarine cables. This aquatic plant, which the European directives defined as a priority habitat to be preserved, plays an essential role in the marine ecosystem as it protects the coastline from erosion and provides shelter and food for numerous organisms. In order to ensure the protection of biodiversity, the Terna Group transplants and relocates Posidonia oceanica meadows before laying the submarine cable. Each project is carried out by highly experienced and qualified personnel, using consolidated techniques to ensure the highest standards of environmental sustainability. Upon completion of the transplant, a conservation and environmental monitoring plan is implemented in order to follow the evolution over time of the volume of Posidonia oceanica meadows in the transplanted areas and the condition of the plant and the surrounding environment. These offsetting projects are currently being planned and designed. Consequently, the quantification of the future resources to be allocated to this activity is currently in progress. Compared to 2024, no direct costs were incurred in this respect. OTHER DOCUMENTS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT ON OPERATIONS"

"258 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT used by Terna to reduce environmental impacts, also in terms of land use. Increasing biodiversity through habitat creation initiatives includes the various activities promoted by the Group, such as the Tiny Forest project and the ‘Biodotti’ project, for the performance of specific actions in the agricultural/natural areas hosting the pylons shown in the above table. In particular, the ‘Biodotti’ target shows the Group’s commitment to improving and increasing biodiversity, also going beyond the logic of the mitigation hierarchy. It should be noticed that the Group in defining the targets represented in the table outlined in the table above, did not use compensation logic. The definition of the target related to the Biodotti project took as a starting assumption the set of pylons existing in 2021 and located in agricultural or natural areas. In particular, in order to identify them, local information systems were used, followed by subsequent specific analyses on company asset databases. Based on this set, the pylons to be involved in the design and implementation projects to enhance biodiversity are identified through joint comparisons and checks against the NTG. These projects include different types of activities which are defined on the basis of the characteristics of the site. These include, inter alia: restoration of shrub cores, creation of artificial hibernacula, inclusion of flowering shrubs and hedges, spreading of flowering plants, creation of reservoirs, reconstruction and restoration of dry stone walls and placement of bat boxes or bird nesting boxes. The final total number of existing pylons in agricultural/natural areas with biodiversity-enhancing measures will be 40 by 2028. With respect to the target concerning the definition and adoption of an SBTN target, the analysis aligned with the methodology of the Science Based Targets Network framework is currently underway. With respect to this process, the materiality analysis aimed at identifying the activities that could potentially negatively impact the environment has already been completed, and the value chain analysis is currently underway. The adoption of a SBTN will enable the company to set a scientifically based and certified target for reducing the Terna Group’s impact on nature, further strengthening its position towards a net positive impact. These targets also drive the Group’s actions in line with recent European regulatory developments. The target related to the removal of obsolete overhead lines is set in accordance with forecasts based on the planned undergrounding and decommissioning activities. Demolition activities depend on the technical implementation of other projects (such as the undergrounding of cables) and on the technical confirmation of feasibility. This flexible approach also implies possible modifications to reflect new technical solutions or changes in local conditions.

"194 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT • monitoring actions to support both preventive and restoration activities. These measures are described, on an annual basis, in the Resilience Plan, a transversal corporate plan that defines all initiatives aimed at preventing and/or reducing damage to the electricity grid caused by increasingly severe weather events in terms of intensity and frequency. As mentioned above, the resilience analysis is continuously evolving, and for this reason, further assessments are underway, such as the analysis of the meteorological and climatic phenomena mentioned earlier. What has been described so far and is outlined below forms the basis for the development of the aforementioned plan, aimed at ensuring the resilience and security of the Terna Group’s infrastructure, as well as providing a reliable and uninterrupted service. In particular, the Resilience Plan includes preventive infrastructural actions to increase resilience to snow and wind, identified with the Resilience Methodology, but also actions in the Development Plan and/or in the Connections Annex that, assessed with the new methodology, are able to reduce the risks of outages during such events. Another innovative infrastructural solution is represented by tower manoeuvring devices (Organi di Manovra su Palo - OMP), a technology conceived at Terna and patented, which consists in equipping the lattice towers that characterise NTG lines of manoeuvring systems, making it possible to increase the resilience and flexibility of operation of portions of the grid with reduced meshing, while also representing a solution with reduced visual and environmental impact. Preventive measures, again related to resilience, also include actions related to the ‘Renewal Plan’, such as reinforcing power lines and cutting down plants and trees, to prevent disruptions related to tree interference on power lines following, for example, high-wind events. Also included in the Resilience Plan are all initiatives related to the Security Plan (of which it is an annex) aimed at mitigating the effects on the grid caused in particular by snow events, such as anti-rotation devices and interphase spacers, and the adoption of technological solutions and tools to monitor the grid, prevent the occurrence of severe events, and speed up service resumption. Finally, the Resilience Plan also includes initiatives to increase resilience for other types of events such as saline and air pollution and fire risk. These are also included in the Security Plan. The Resilience Plan 2024 also expands the portfolio of initiatives to increase the resilience of the NTG through the support of digitalisation, envisaging the use of IoT techniques aimed at the widespread collection of information on the assets and which, together with complex calculation algorithms, guarantee the optimal and resilient operation of the electricity system. Additional support to the capital expenditure for the security and resilience of the NTG comes in the form of public funding under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and the related revision with the REPowerEU chapter, in relation to which the Group was awarded €150 million for the NRRP and €140 million for the REPowerEU, with the objective, on the one hand, of increasing the resilience of 1,500 km of NTG lines for severe weather events and, on the other hand, to start the digitalisation the NTG, ensuring safe and resilient operation. It should be noted that the Resilience Plan is an annex to the broader Defence Plan for the Security of the National Electricity System (Security Plan) that Terna prepares annually.

In the Security Plan 2024, Terna strengthens its capital expenditure and initiatives to better execute its role as an enabler of the energy transition, based on three strategic directions: • the adoption of key technological solutions to address voltage regulation and electricity system stability requirements, such as synchronous compensators, reactors and stabilising resistors; • the digital evolution of the electricity system, which transversally involves several areas of grid management, from supervision, control and defence of the system to infrastructure security to protect against physical and cybersecurity risks; • increasing grid resilience in the face of intensifying extreme weather events, which through preventive, restoration and monitoring initiatives aim, also thanks to the support offered by digitalisation, to ensure increasingly high standards of electricity service continuity."
"196 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Protecting biodiversity The interaction of the Group’s activities with biodiversity is mainly related to the physical presence of power lines and electricity substations78 and their impact on the surrounding environment, which can be both natural and man-made. In particular, with reference to the construction phase of the works, great attention is paid to the choice of areas and access tracks, selected, when possible, in areas of lesser natural value. In the case of submarine power lines, the impacts concern the integrity of the seabed on which the undersea cables are laid. Regarding laying and maintenance operations, the impacts primarily concern aquatic flora species such as, for example, Posidonia oceanica. In this context, the search for the route constitutes the most delicate design phase as it determines the future impact on the environment and biodiversity of the entire development project. For this reason, Terna, without prejudice to the need to identify a route that allows for the regular operation and maintenance of the power line, seeks design solutions that minimise the amount of land used, interference with areas of environmental, natural, landscape, and archaeological value whether urbanised or urban development areas, and the encumbrances on the properties involved79. The support of the GIS technology (‘Geographic Information System’), is fundamental when searching for sustainable locations (corridors) for National Transmission Grid (NTG) development projects. This technology allows comprehensive consideration of all information relating to the different types of land use and protection obligations (territorial, naturalistic, cultural, landscape, etc.), in order to identify possible locations which are the most compatible with the area concerned. The interaction between Terna lines and substations and protected areas or areas of natural interest is constantly monitored. Therefore, all of the Group’s assets are assessed with the support of GIS technology, and overall, monitoring includes all substations (915 in 2024) and power lines (68,374 km in 2024). With the support of this database, it has been carried out an inventory of possible interferences between assets and protected area or areas of high biodiversity, cross-referencing data on the electricity grid with local data. (in 2024, there were 7,276.24 km of power lines and 34 electricity substations interfering with protected areas; for more details, see the tables on page 259, in the context of paragraph “Metrics related to biodiversity protection”). Considering that interventions in protected areas are reduced to a minimum by virtue of the application of ERPA procedures, the mitigation measures required by legislation and ordered by local authorities are applied for new works. The Double Materiality Assessment 2024 identified and considered the impacts that may collectively concern the Group’s activities with respect to biodiversity, it was not deemed necessary to break down the impacts by specific sites. This detail is carried out following the requirements and environmental impact assessment for the implementation of the Development Plan. The Double Materiality Assessment considered the direct and indirect impacts of Terna’s activities on biodiversity and ecosystems, assessing both actual and potential impacts. Starting from an analysis of internal and external corporate documents, also considering sector-specific guidelines of the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a series of impacts related to the topics and sub-topics indicated by the ESRS standards were then identified. The identified impacts were submitted to the relevant corporate functions and external sustainability experts, who assessed their materiality based on the criteria of significance and likelihood. The contribution of the functions involved in the context of the Double Materiality Assessment is of particular importance since they are responsible for ensuring ongoing dialogue with the stakeholders as a fundamental element of the preparatory activities for updating and implementing the Development Plan. The Group is constantly committed to establishing and implementing the most efficient forms of engagement and participatory planning, with particular FOCUS 78 For a list of sites, see the tables ‘Details of power lines owned by the Terna Group’ and ‘Details of electricity substations owned by the Terna Group’ on page 388. 79 Terna’s planning includes the study of site plans aimed at using existing roads or tracks to minimise the opening of new tracks, especially in wooded or protected areas, and the assessment of problems related to cutting vegetation, adopting methodologies and tools to minimise interference such as optimising the height of supports and their location. Agreement on location criteria is the instrument used for selecting local corridors with least impact. These criteria are used to identify the greater or lesser degree of suitability of an area to host new electricity infrastructure. Terna and the Regions have agreed on a system of ERPA criteria (Exclusion; Repulsion; Problems; Attraction), based on four classes, to be adopted when locating new electrical works. Protected areas, including the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) categories that coincide with these, fall into the ‘Repulsion’ category, which binds Terna not to operate unless there are no alternatives or there are only alternatives that are even less environmentally compatible.

"197 2024 ANNUAL REPORT | TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business focus on local communities affected by grid development projects. Generally, the Group’s work follows certain general operating standards, with regard to stakeholder engagement activities to be carried out, in the various phases of the NTG development process, from the planning to the Strategic Environmental Assessment for the Plan, and from the planning of individual works, to the related approval and their completion. Of particular note, among the activities in the areas affected by the development of the grid are the ‘Terna Incontra’, described in the section on local communities. Terna identified and assessed dependencies on biodiversity, ecosystems and related services through a process that considers the synergies between nature and climate, also considering that which is specified in the TNFD sector-specific guidelines. In particular, the TNFD does not identify nature-related dependencies directly related to electricity transmission and dispatching activities, thus identifying a potential dependency in certain ecosystem services80 in relation to the increasingly frequent occurrence of extreme weather events due to climate change, including mitigation of natural hazards such as floods and storm surges, control of erosion and stabilisation of the soil and slopes. The assessment therefore took into account the dependencies of ecosystem services that regulate climate, and how these affect the integrity of the energy transmission infrastructures. For example, climate regulation ecosystem services contribute to protect infrastructure from extreme weather events, such as abnormal rainfall and temperature variations, which could damage it. Phenomenons such as loss of vegetation and degradation of ecosystems instead increase the risk of damage caused by floods and extreme weather events, with negative effects on company assets. Terna’s approach to biodiversity is also reflected in a potential increase in the Group’s attractiveness in the financial markets, also in view of the growing interest of investors and rating agencies specialised in ESG topics, aspects that are constantly analysed and monitored by the Group’s Sustainability department. As regards the process of identifying and assessing opportunities related to biodiversity, this has been including in the context of Double Materiality analysis, for further details see the dedicated section at page 179. 80 Ecosystem services are defined as the contributions deriving from ecosystem resources providing benefit to economic activity and other human activity. For example, the supply of timber and firewood from a forest, the freshwater of a river, the recreational and tourism opportunities of a forest or coral reef, and the pollination of crops. Ecosystem services fall into three categories: provisioning services, such as the supply of crops, wood or water; regulating and maintenance services, such as water flow regulation and climate regulation; and cultural services, such as recreation activities and tourism opportunities. For further details see the ‘Recommendations of the Task Force on Nature- related Financial Disclosures’ page 26 (https://tnfd.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ Recommendations_of_the_Taskforce_on_Nature- related_Financial_Disclosures_September_2023.pdf?v=1695118661). According to the “Addictional sector guidance - Electric utilities and power generators” of the TNFD, the operational integrity of transmission and distribution infrastructure may depend on: (i) ecosystem service of global climate regulation, to protect the transmission and distribution infrastructure, from unstable rainfall and temperature patterns, which may affect maintenance and integrity; (ii) ecosystem service of rainfall regulation and mitigation of extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones or floods, to ensure stability and uninterrupted operation of electricity transmission and distribution systems. (iii) ecosystem service of soil and sediment retention, mainly provided by different types of vegetation and other environmental assets. Through soil and sediment retention, impacts and damage caused by landslides and erosion are mitigated."
"198 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Promoting the circular economy The Double Materiality Assessment considered the direct and indirect impacts of the Group’s activities related to resource use and the circular economy, assessing both actual and potential impacts. To begin with, an analysis of internal and external corporate documents takes place, specifically considering environmental analyses such as, for example, the Life Cycle Assessment with methodology EF 3.011 promoted by the European Commission81, which the environmental impacts of overhead lines, cable lines and electricity substations are assessed throughout their life cycle, including downstream impacts. A series of impacts related to the topics and sub-topics indicated by the ESRS standards were then identified. The identified impacts were then submitted to the relevant corporate functions and external sustainability experts, who assessed their materiality based on the criteria of significance and likelihood. Own workforce The quality of human capital is fundamental for Terna Group’s growth and to foster value creation over time. People, with their training, the skills they have developed over the years, managerial skills, motivation, loyalty and sense of belonging, are central to all company activities. Moreover, they are individuals whose rights must be respected and valued. Terna, with People Strategy pursues the objective of putting people at the centre of an ecosystem characterised by mutual respect, inclusiveness, widespread well-being, a sense of responsibility and results orientation. This vision drives the company’s cultural change, which is implemented through initiatives and tools aimed at promoting more efficient ways of working, developing skills, valuing merit and measuring performance with a continuous improvement approach. Dialogue with the workforce is developed within a well- established system of industrial relations, which includes the involvement of trade unions, and through regular initiatives for direct dialogue with employee, such as online surveys, focus groups and other internal engagement activities. This approach makes it possible to integrate the interests and opinions of employees into the company’s activities. In this way, each person has the opportunity to contribute to the collective growth and achievement of company goals. The material impacts on Terna’s own workforce, identified through the Double Materiality Assessment, derive directly from Terna’s approach to its people, in line with its People Strategy, and are also influenced by the strength of its business model. In particular, impacts include benefits related to secure employment, the adoption of FOCUS FOCUS 81 This method is based on a set of standardised environmental indicators covering several impact categories, including those related to nature and biodiversity. Impacts are assessed using specific models and characterisation factors that consider environmental pressures such as land use change, pollution, climate change and resource extraction.

These policies are defined in compliance with applicable regulations and reference best practices, and periodically updated, taking into account changes in the scenario and instances that emerge from the engagement activities conducted with the Group’s stakeholders, such as the dialogue initiatives set up for the purpose of the double materiality process, in order to ensure that they can represent a valid tool for the management of aspects related to the promotion of the circular economy. The Group’s policies are also shared with and disseminated to stakeholders through specific communication activities differentiated according to the stakeholders, such as, for instance, the publication on the website or other types of documents where deemed necessary, and through further targeted information and/or training initiatives. Circular Economy Strategy and Roadmap For the Terna Group, the Circular Economy Strategy, defined in 2022 and adopted in order to address and manage material impacts on resource use and the circular economy, is a further contribution to the transformation process underway to establish a new economic model that respects natural capital. Indeed, it is applied to all the Parent Company’s subsidiaries and is a benchmark value for all the other Group Companies. Circular Economy Strategy is aligned with key international regulations and initiatives, including the European Union’s Circular Economy Action Plan and the Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, it is consistent with the guidelines set by environmental management standards, such as the ISO 14001 standard. The definition of the strategy considered potential collaborations with some key stakeholders, in particular by involving the supply chain to identify circularity solutions applicable to materials. In addition, the Company engages in dialogue with institutions and associations that promote sustainability such as Sustainability Makers and Global Compact, in order to reflect any changes in the regulatory framework and industry best practices. At the methodological level, the Circular Economy Strategy is aligned with the Long-Term Value Framework (LTV) developed by EY, which identifies long-term value levers through 4 steps: • establish the business context, purpose and strategy; • evaluate stakeholder results; • identify strategic capabilities and value drivers; • develop metrics for long-term value. The LTV framework has been integrated with two other standards: British Standard 8001:2017 and Circulytics. BS 8001:2017 is a voluntary standard which provides a set of requirements for implementing Circular Economy principles within an organisation. Specifically, it is based on six principles to assesses an organisation’s circular economy maturity: Systemic Vision, Innovation, Governance, Collaboration, Optimising Value and Transparency.

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business Circulytics is a methodology that measures a company’s performance in terms of circular economy along two dimensions: • enablers, i.e. the enabling factors that a company can adopt to effectively manage the transition to a circular economy model. These enable the definition of strategic circularity priorities and the development of systems and assets to support circular economy activities by capturing a company’s circularity potential; • outcomes, i.e. topics that measure the current level of circular economy controls at company level in relation to: flows of material, water, energy, service and product design or procurement, decommissioning of plants, property and capital goods. Furthermore, the Circular Economy Procurement Framework was used as a reference for the definition of the strategy. This is the most authoritative standard on the topic and was developed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to help companies start circular economy initiatives in their procurement process. The framework provides an overview of actions that organisations can implement to improve the circularity of their procurement choices and engage their suppliers in circular economy conversations and collaborative circular partnerships. With this programme, launched at the end of 2021, the Company is pursuing the objective of integrating circularity into its business model to strengthen its sustainability, and also extending it to its supply chain. In 2022, the Company drew up its Circular Economy Strategy and subsequently set out the Roadmap of actions through to 2030 for the procurement of materials and their correct use, the sustainable use of resources, including secondary raw materials, and the management of waste."
"262 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT The reference framework is based on four pillars – each related to a phase of the Group’s operating cycle (including Non-regulated Activities) – which respond to the need to focus each circularity action in the Company to a specific business area, namely: • Procurement • Asset management • Operation of the electricity grid • The disposal of assets The above enabling factors, being those elements essential to effectively manage the transition to a circular economy model, are as follows: 1) Systemic vision: the organisation’s vision of the circular economy and its integration into business processes. 2) Innovation: integrating circularity into innovation processes. 3) Governance: integrationof circular economy principles into the corporate decision-making and strategic structure. 4) Collaboration: establish collaborations inside and outside the company in order to create value and operate with a circular approach. 5) Optimising Value: maximise the value of company assets throughout their lifetime. 6) Transparency: communicateits circular economy initiatives within and outside the company. 7) Performance assessment: measure actions and targets related to the circular economy. The Circular Economy Roadmap is based on this strategic vision and establishes initiatives and actions designed to embed the concept of circularity within the corporate’s business model. The Roadmap covers the period through to 2030 and is aligned with the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, which has been integrated with the 2024-2028 Industrial Plan. The progress towards the expected targets is subject to structured monitoring in order to identify any deviations and, consequently, implement corrective actions. The targets of the Circular Economy Roadmap are as follows: • Develop a culture of circularity throughout the organisation and to protect our planet while ensuring business continuity; • Reduce the use of raw materials, specifically non-renewable and non-recyclable materials that have a strong impact on health and the environment; • Create a supply chain that respects circularity criteria in its business; • Define structured design and management to minimise the resulting environmental impacts; • Facilitate the country’s energy transition to RES through asset development activities; • Develop solutions that support the energy transition of the system and enable the smart exchange of energy with the grid; • Reduce the GHG emissions released due to the dispersion of gases with a high global warming potential; • Increase the reuse of assets and the use of waste; • Create a supply chain based on the optimisation of reuse and recycling to minimise externalities and negative impacts, in order to avoid sending the waste produced to landfills; • Preserve the ecosystems in which the business operates by maintaining the current levels of biodiversity and avoiding the depletion and further consumption of land.

"263 2024 ANNUAL REPORT | TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business Therefore, with respect to governance and the integration of the processes related to the procurement of materials and their correct use and the sustainable use of resources, including the use of secondary raw materials and waste management, the adoption of the Circular Economy Roadmap plays a crucial role for the organisation. Targets are broken down into actions with a final deadline and maximum internal responsibility for their implementation to achieve the relevant goals. Responsibility is often shared between two or more departments, thereby promoting synergies between different organisational structures. Each action is matched to one or more KPIs, i.e. the performance indicators that measure the implementation of the actions through the identification of targets. In this respect, in order to constantly improve and progressively align with developing business needs, new regulations and best-practices in the sector, the Roadmap is a dynamic tool, which is revised and expanded over time, also on the basis of the results obtained during monitoring of the progress of the initiatives towards achieving the expected targets. The programme, formally adopted in early 2023, was subject to specific induction during which the Group’s Head of Procurement, Head of Sustainability and CRO submitted the actions necessary to integrate circularity into Terna Group’s business model to the Board of directors, Board of Statutory Auditors and Chief Executive Officer. The implementation of the Circular Economy Roadmap is based on the synergy between different company departments and, as already mentioned, is aligned with the main European and national circularity initiatives. The definition process involved internal and external stakeholders, taking into account sector best practices and regulatory benchmarks. Its success also depends on the collaboration with the supply chain and other actors in the supply chain, which must integrate circularity principles into their processes and procurement activities. This document is regularly updated and, therefore, is a dynamic tool which can adapt to changing legislation and business needs. Terna Group’s Integrated Management System Policy In line with the principles of the Code of Ethics and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Terna Group has adopted the Integrated Management System Policy, which reflects the will of the Board of Directors (hereinafter the “BoD”), responsible for approving the policy, to adopt a guiding tool for defining strategic objectives, which complies with the requirements of the ISO standards and is aligned with the organisational context. The IMS Policy is approved by Terna’s Board of Directors. The related guidelines are valid for all corporate processes and activities. It is therefore the responsibility of the entire management to implement these guidelines. Monitoring of the implementation of the Policy is carried out annually through the Integrated Management System Review and through annual Audits by the Certification Body (Third Party). Specifically, the Policy addresses, inter alia, waste, with the aim of managing the related material impacts, in line with the evidence of the double materiality assessment. With respect to the principles set out therein and applicable to waste, Terna Group undertakes to comply with the requirements of the Environmental Management System in accordance with the UNI EN ISO 14001:2015 standard. Therefore, it undertakes, in particular, to focus on waste management, moving towards material recycling, in accordance with circular economy guidelines. This transition is the main reference for waste hierarchy. The Policy, which is appropriate to the nature, purpose and human and financial resources of the company, is applied by all Italian and overseas companies, wholly owned directly by the Parent Company, and in any case is a benchmark value for all the other Group companies. Furthermore, all personnel individually commit to observing the Policy by accepting its contents. The commitment described in the Integrated Policy is requested also from companies and personnel working in outsourcing, through specific contractual clauses and qualification and selection processes. The principles set out in the Integrated Policy are disseminated among employees through internal training initiatives, and among stakeholders by making the document available on the institutional website."
"264 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT IO008HSE “Waste management in Terna Group Companies” The aim of this corporate regulatory document is to define the operating procedures to be adopted for correct waste management and is applied to all Terna Group companies in the electricity sector and where waste is produced. The organisational matrix for environmental management, including waste management, is consistent with that for security management as the company’s structure provides for separate Production Units (PUs), the heads of which individually represent the company to the extent of their remit (in brief, the “Employer”). In addition to that described in relation to the Circular Economy Roadmap, in particular with respect to waste management and material recycling, various tools for monitoring and managing activities are in place. These include the quarterly assessment of the targets assigned to each department and the annual monitoring of environmental data, specifically in relation to waste, in accordance with IO012HSE “Definition and data collection for environmental indicators”. In order to ensure effective waste management, the Terna Group has designated a waste manager who is responsible, inter alia, for the correct classification and characterisation of waste and for managing temporary storage. Actions related to the promotion of circular economy As part of its activities, the Terna Group implements a series of actions aimed at preventing, mitigating and correcting its material impacts related to the promotion of circular economy, in line with the principles and targets of the policies adopted and described earlier. In 2024, the Terna Group continued to monitor the Roadmap of Actions to 2030 relating to the Circular Economy Strategy for the procurement of materials and their proper use, sustainable use of resources including secondary raw materials, and waste management. Therefore, based on the scope of reference, the actions implemented in 2024 and any further initiatives planned by the Group for the coming years are listed below. Resource inflow, including resource use Complete survey of supplies containing secondary raw materials for assets composition The development and maintenance of the NTG requires an important supply of power line assets (pylons, conductors, insulators), transformer substations (transformers, circuit breakers, other substation equipment) and control systems. Terna does not purchase raw materials, but finished products (electrical equipment, conductors, tools and other components). The materials include steel (pylons), aluminium and copper (conductors and cables). Therefore, in order to identify supplies which included secondary raw materials, Terna conducted an initial market survey in 2023 to identify suppliers that use environmentally high-performance goods for power lines, underground cables and electricity substation components. Therefore, the analysis covered the asset procurement phase (upstream value chain) and involved the main suppliers operating in the electricity sector. The survey showed a certain maturity in terms of meeting specific requirements and investment in improving environmental performance in production cycles. The information gathered from the market survey, in particular the percentages of raw materials comprising various assets, was subsequently used for an initial estimate of the percentage of recycled raw material use in supplies purchased during 2024. The results obtained are not fully representative for the definition of a percentage of recycled raw material use in the overall purchased assets. However, they are a starting point for the next in-depth studies planned for 2025 and 2026, which will strengthen awareness and dialogue with suppliers, fostering the evolution of the market towards increasingly sustainable solutions.

"256 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Biodiversity offsets in Terna Group projects The Terna Group uses biodiversity offsetting techniques. Below is a list of the types of actions included in its action plans: Habitat reconstruction projects carried out in Italy, which may involve areas with newly built and/or demolished supports, electricity substations and construction sites. The relevant design criteria are based on the principles and methods of naturalistic silviculture, which entails the exclusive use of native species, selected in line with the existing vegetation and the environmental conditions of the site, in order to obtain the highest possible level of biodiversity and phytosociological consistency with the surrounding areas. A twofold aim was pursued when selecting revegetation techniques: restore the stages of the dynamic series of the site’s potential natural vegetation and, at the same time, guarantee anti-erosive and soil protection functions while limiting colonisation by invasive alien species by grassing all the areas affected by the works. Different types of action are planned and implemented based on the characteristics of the affected area, adopting those that are most suitable for the environmental context. Post-construction maintenance activities which maintain the environmental functions of the area involved also play an essential role. The years of maintenance activities may vary depending on the type of action. Consequently, when used as an indicator, they are always shown/reported/explained in the related contracts. These offsetting projects are currently being planned and designed. Consequently, the quantification of the future resources to be allocated to this activity is currently in progress. Compared to 2024, no direct costs were incurred in this respect. Transplanting olive trees: transplanting protected tree species, such as olive trees, is a key environmental offsetting technique adopted by the Terna Group. This action is necessary when the site of a converter station is in an area with olive trees, thereby ensuring the preservation of these valuable plants and safeguarding local biodiversity. Through a careful uprooting and replanting process, defined with the support of specialised agronomists, olive trees are transplanted using techniques that favour their adaptation and growth. Each phase of the project, from pruning to relocation, is designed to ensure the vegetative recovery of the trees, thereby contributing to the preservation of the landscape and the protection of biodiversity. The monetary effects of this biodiversity offsetting activity include capital expenditure of approximately €1,979,100, recognised in the consolidated financial statements item “Property, plant and equipment”. Transplanting Posidonia oceanic meadows is an environmental offsetting technique used by the Terna Group to restore sea meadows crossed by submarine cables. This aquatic plant, which the European directives defined as a priority habitat to be preserved, plays an essential role in the marine ecosystem as it protects the coastline from erosion and provides shelter and food for numerous organisms. In order to ensure the protection of biodiversity, the Terna Group transplants and relocates Posidonia oceanica meadows before laying the submarine cable. Each project is carried out by highly experienced and qualified personnel, using consolidated techniques to ensure the highest standards of environmental sustainability. Upon completion of the transplant, a conservation and environmental monitoring plan is implemented in order to follow the evolution over time of the volume of Posidonia oceanica meadows in the transplanted areas and the condition of the plant and the surrounding environment. These offsetting projects are currently being planned and designed. Consequently, the quantification of the future resources to be allocated to this activity is currently in progress. Compared to 2024, no direct costs were incurred in this respect. OTHER DOCUMENTS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT ON OPERATIONS"

Objectives of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan update - ‘Creation of shared value’ Pillar OBJECTIVE TARGET BOUNDARY METRIC AND RELATED UNIT OF MEASUREMENT MILESTONE 2025 2026 2027 2028 Actions to increase biodiversity near company assets - the Biodotti project Terna Group No. of projects to enhance biodiversity on existing supports 20 25 30 40 Continuation of the programme to remove obsolete overhead lines in line with the industrial plan Terna Group Kilometres of obsolete overhead lines removed 50 160 155 130 For the sake of completeness, it is noted that the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan included a target of 103 km of obsolete lines removed. In 2024, 69.6 km of obsolete overhead lines were removed. This target was not met due to postponements. Some demolitions have been postponed until 2025 or later, pending the completion of the necessary works. It should be noted that the number of biodiversity enhancement interventions on existing supports was 17 in 2024, a year for which no target value had been set. The above targets were processed and represented, for the first time, in the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the first integrated with the Industrial Plan. The base year to be considered for the formulation of the targets is therefore, as a rule, 2024. It is therefore necessary to wait for the 2025 final balance for a proper assessment of trends. The updated Sustainability Plan, whose guidelines were shared at the Sustainability Governance and Scenarios Board Committee and also represented within the Industrial Plan document submitted to the board of directors, did not require any particular changes in terms of metrics or methodologies for these objectives. The targets related to the protection of biodiversity and ecosystems also show the Group’s broader approach to this topic covered by the relevant Policies. Indeed, the Biodotti project and the removal of obsolete overhead lines are in line with the principles of No net loss of biodiversity and, where possible, Net improvement, and are consistent with the mitigation hierarchy, on which the Biodiversity Commitment, the Integrated Management System Policy and the Development Plan’s Strategic Environmental Assessment Guideline are based. As part of the definition of targets and initiatives, the priorities identified by the double materiality and environmental assessment carried out in order to maintain the ISO 14001 certification were considered. No further specific ecological thresholds were considered. In this respect, developments are possible based on the Group’s path towards the adoption of a Science-based Target for Nature (included in the targets of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan) in line with the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) methodology. Furthermore, the SBTN methodology provides a framework that is consistent with global and regional biodiversity policies and regulations, such as those established by COP15 and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030, which enable companies to set scientifically sound and measurable biodiversity targets. In order to achieve this target, in 2024, the first phase of the preparatory activities envisaged in the methodology was completed, with the adoption of a 2026 target as a milestone. This activity sets a target based on a certified scientific methodology to minimise the Group’s impacts in terms of changes to biodiversity. Biodiversity-related targets are linked to the impacts identified as part of the double materiality assessment and are also tools for mitigating changes to biodiversity and enhancing the positive effects related to the initiatives undertaken by the Group. Specifically, the physical removal of obsolete lines is one of the rehabilitation and restoration ways MDR-T < E4-4 <"
"258 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT used by Terna to reduce environmental impacts, also in terms of land use. Increasing biodiversity through habitat creation initiatives includes the various activities promoted by the Group, such as the Tiny Forest project and the ‘Biodotti’ project, for the performance of specific actions in the agricultural/natural areas hosting the pylons shown in the above table. In particular, the ‘Biodotti’ target shows the Group’s commitment to improving and increasing biodiversity, also going beyond the logic of the mitigation hierarchy. It should be noticed that the Group in defining the targets represented in the table outlined in the table above, did not use compensation logic. The definition of the target related to the Biodotti project took as a starting assumption the set of pylons existing in 2021 and located in agricultural or natural areas. In particular, in order to identify them, local information systems were used, followed by subsequent specific analyses on company asset databases. Based on this set, the pylons to be involved in the design and implementation projects to enhance biodiversity are identified through joint comparisons and checks against the NTG. These projects include different types of activities which are defined on the basis of the characteristics of the site. These include, inter alia: restoration of shrub cores, creation of artificial hibernacula, inclusion of flowering shrubs and hedges, spreading of flowering plants, creation of reservoirs, reconstruction and restoration of dry stone walls and placement of bat boxes or bird nesting boxes. The final total number of existing pylons in agricultural/natural areas with biodiversity-enhancing measures will be 40 by 2028. With respect to the target concerning the definition and adoption of an SBTN target, the analysis aligned with the methodology of the Science Based Targets Network framework is currently underway. With respect to this process, the materiality analysis aimed at identifying the activities that could potentially negatively impact the environment has already been completed, and the value chain analysis is currently underway. The adoption of a SBTN will enable the company to set a scientifically based and certified target for reducing the Terna Group’s impact on nature, further strengthening its position towards a net positive impact. These targets also drive the Group’s actions in line with recent European regulatory developments. The target related to the removal of obsolete overhead lines is set in accordance with forecasts based on the planned undergrounding and decommissioning activities. Demolition activities depend on the technical implementation of other projects (such as the undergrounding of cables) and on the technical confirmation of feasibility. This flexible approach also implies possible modifications to reflect new technical solutions or changes in local conditions.

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business Detailed study of energy and material flows used to perform Terna Group’s core business and periodic measurement of corporate circularity with KPIs and specific tools Assessing the circular economy is a new and complex process that often involves many actors and requires a considerable amount of data. Circular economy is found in multiple aspects of the production cycle of goods or services and is now defined by a sound regulatory framework, established at European level by the Circular Economy Action Plan and at national level by the National Strategy for the Circular Economy. Furthermore, UNI TS 11820, the first technical specification for measuring the circularity of a company was published in 2022 ( updated in 2024). The study on energy and material flows was conducted in 2024 and focused mainly on the grid assets managed by Terna Rete Italia S.p.A.. It covered the upstream value chain, analysing 2023 stocks of materials comprising grid assets, and the downstream supply chain, examining the residual useful life, hence, the future needs in terms of replacement of assets and materials to be included in the disposal/recovery cycle. The geographical scope of the action is limited to Italy, given the nature of Terna Group’s business and the focus on Italy’s grid assets. The stakeholders involved include both internal functions (purchasing, engineering, environmental management) and external actors, such as suppliers and academic partners, with which the Group collaborates to develop advanced circularity measurement methodologies. Energy flow analysis was used to examine changes in consumption over the years between different consumption sites (electricity substations, buildings, etc.). The circularity level was calculated using a specially developed tool and took into account a number of indicators, some of which will be further refined in 2025 to improve the representativeness of the figure. Measurement will continue with the aim of broadening the engagement of further business areas and stakeholders in order to consolidate a structured approach to circularity management. The indicators for the calculation of circularity, defined and developed based on the UNI TS 11820 technical specification, adapted to the business context, considered the results of the analysis of energy and material flows, in addition to a series of additional information such as percentages of sorted waste, energy classifications of all buildings, assets and infrastructures that provide for circular end-of-life management solutions, critical raw material inputs from recycling and/ or recovery and/or by-products. SF6 gas regeneration At the end of 2020, the Closed Cycle Management of SF6 project has been launched, aimed at managing the entire life cycle of SF6 gas during ordinary and extraordinary plant maintenance operations, in collaboration with Synecom, a company specialised in the closed cycle management of regenerated SF6 gas. This activity, which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is already in place, resulted perfectly in line with the targets set by Terna Group in 2023 in the Circular Economy Roadmap during the circularity analysis. Therefore, it was included therein. The action covers the entire lifecycle of SF6 gas within the grid operation, covering: the supply of regenerated SF6 gas to replace new gas, reducing the need for new production and the related emissions (upstream chain); the treatment of decommissioned SF6 gas, which was previously disposed of through thermal destruction and now, thanks to the project, is treated in accordance with a regeneration process and reintroduced into the operating cycle (downstream chain). Before the launch of this collaboration, SF6 gas disposed of during routine and extraordinary maintenance, due to it no longer functioning as an insulator, was sent for final disposal (thermal destruction) and replaced with new gas. Both the production of new SF6 gas and the disposal of the old gas result in leakages and, therefore, greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The regeneration thus enables a doubling of the reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions. In detail, according to Synecom, the emissions saved for each kg of SF6 not produced from new (because regenerated"
"266 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT gas is purchased) are between 3 and 8% (average loss rates for production plants), whilst those saved for each kg of SF6 not sent for thermal destruction are between 2% and 4% (average loss rates for thermal destruction plants), according to the values shown in the 2019 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The average percentage of avoided emissions with the same amount of non-produced and non-destroyed new gas is 8.5% (5.5% +3%). This action covers Italian plants. During the four-year period 2021-2024, approximately 33,736 kg of SF6 gas have been regenerated, preventing the leakage into the atmosphere of approximately 2,868 kg (resulting from the sum of the leakage during production of new gas and the disposal of disused gas) which, based on the 8.5% average between non-production and non-destruction, amounts to 67,398 tonnes of CO2 equivalent avoided. The emissions prevented correspond with those emitted in a year by approximately 8,100 diesel fuel vehicles. In the Circular Economy Roadmap, a target of regenerating 57,000 kg of SF6 gas by 2028 has been set. The target has been calculated taking into account the average quantity of gas regenerated annually to meet with Terna’s needs, i.e., the kilograms of SF6 gas disposed of. Innovative projects to contain SF6 leakage In 2024, Terna S.p.A. and Terna Rete Italia S.p.A. identified an innovative solution that could be tested in order to limit the greenhouse gas emissions related to its core business, with particular reference to SF6 gas used in GIS stations. This solution, which involves the French supplier Mastergrid, uses a metal “cover” that is specifically designed and sized for a particular flange of the GIS system. Mastergrid’s solution will be tested during 2025 on a leakage point at the GIS plant in Ceprano (central Italy). This first test on a single plant is necessary in order to check the effectiveness in terms of containing SF6 gas leaks. Should the first test be successful, a large-scale planning process may begin over a medium-term horizon, specifically starting from 2026. This will therefore include the identification of new potential test sites, presumably evenly located throughout the country, and technical-economic assessments preliminary to final adoption. Waste At the end of the normal life cycle of the finished products purchased to expand and maintain the NTG (electrical equipment, conductors, equipment and other elements), the materials comprising such products are recovered for reuse in operations. Only a residual portion is sent to landfill. Whilst the overall amount of waste produced reflects the timing of equipment replacements, effectual recovery depends on the materials contained in the waste: some of them are easy to separate out and thus reuse (for example, iron parts of pylons). In other cases, it is either too costly or not possible to separate the various parts, above all when dealing with the most obsolete equipment. For these reasons, annual changes in the amount of waste generated and the percentage of waste recycles should not be interpreted as indicating a trend. Monitoring of the waste generated and the means of waste management employed are audited both internally and externally as per ISO 14001 certification requirements, as are the methods of waste disposal, to ensure compliance with existing legislation.

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business The main special hazardous waste generated by the operation of power lines and substations with high recovery percentages, consists of: • Metal waste. Waste results from the decommissioning of transformers, electrical equipment and machinery that is no longer used and contaminated by hazardous substances. • Batteries. In the event of a blackout, batteries enable emergency generators to be switched on in order to keep the energy transformation and transportation service up and running during emergencies. • Dielectric oils. Used for isolating transformers replaced after periodic transformer maintenance checks. The waste sent for disposal mainly consists of materials deriving from infrastructure maintenance and cleaning activities (oily emulsions and rags containing solvent oils) and insulating materials containing asbestos, for which no form of recovery is envisaged. The main actions carried out by the Group during the year in order to pursue the targets set out in its waste management policies are as follows: Tracking and reporting on waste using the Atlantide software As part of the project to digitalise its processes, in 2024, Terna S.p.A. and Terna Rete Italia S.p.A. introduced a system to support the administrative management of waste in order to increase efficiency and achieve a high level of control. This need will also combine with the entry into effect of the new National Electronic Waste Traceability Register (RENTRI). Indeed, the software will allow interoperability with the RENTRI information system, facilitating the communication of waste traceability data from Terna to RENTRI. This new software will also enable Terna to extract more reliable and accurate reports on waste that also provide greater control over waste recycling rates. Transforming used PPE (clothing, shoes and helmets) into secondary raw materials Optimising the recycling of waste by transforming Terna S.p.A.’s and Terna Rete Italia S.p.A.’s PPE into second raw materials began in 2021 and is still in place as part of the collaboration with ESO Benefit. ESO stands out from other market operators which collect the same type of waste thanks to its expertise in the back-to-work services provided to companies that use PPE, such as work clothes, helmets and shoes. The service provides for the collection and recycling of PPE that, once worn out and having reached the end of its life cycle, is sent to a recycling process. The back-to-work service enables companies to optimise their separate waste collection, transforming waste into new resources and adopting good corporate social responsibility practices. In particular, the material collected by ESO and correctly characterised is not finally disposed of by incineration (as is the case for the vast majority of this type of waste). In fact, it is sent to treatment processes that transform it into secondary raw materials (SRM). Specifically, the recycled part of shoes may be transformed into an anti-shock floor which, for example, is particularly suitable for children’s playgrounds. The pilot use will be agreed directly with ESO, until 2028, based on the waste recycled in recent years."
"268 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Metrics and targets related to the promotion of circular economy Goals of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan As part of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the Terna Group has defined a series of specific targets to assess the progress with respect to the circular economy and the related material impacts, also with a view to ensuring a clear path towards achieving the objectives identified by the thematic policies adopted by the Group and reported on previously. Objectives of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan update - ‘Sustainable value chain’ Pillar OBJECTIVE TARGET BOUNDARY METRIC AND RELATED UNIT OF MEASUREMENT MILESTONE 2025 2026 2027 2028 Recupero e rigenerazione del gas SF6 Gruppo Terna Kg di gas SF6 rigenerato 42.000 47.000 52.000 57.000 The above target was developed and set out, for the first time, in the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the first to be integrated with the Industrial Plan. The base year to be considered for the formulation of the target is therefore, as a rule, 2024. It is therefore necessary to wait for the 2025 final balance for a proper assessment of performance and trends. The updated Sustainability Plan, whose guidelines were shared at the Sustainability Governance and Scenarios Board Committee and also represented within the Industrial Plan document submitted to the board of directors, did not require any particular changes in terms of metrics or methodologies for this objective. It should be noted that in 2024, 33,036 kg of SF6 gas were regenerated, a year for which a target value had not been set. The Sustainability Plan includes another target which is relevant to resource outflows, namely the 100% recovery of hazardous waste by 2028. For this target, which is linked to the “Waste” reference metric reported below, no significant Milestones are currently planned within the plan’s timeframe, and developments regarding the target’s applicability scope, originally conceived for the Electrical Perimeter, will be monitored within the dedicated Coordination Group.The above targets are consistent with those included in the Circular Economy Roadmap and Terna Group’s Integrated Management System Policy, and comply with the UNI ISO 14001 standard. These targets were drawn up taking into account the main international frameworks (e.g. UNI EN ISO 14001:2015) and also take into account the requirements expressed by the various rating agencies specialised in sustainability topics. The target for SF6 gas was defined based on the projected need for this gas over the next few years. Terna’s use of regenerated gas complies with Regulation (EU) 2024/573, which aims to promote the use of regenerated gas rather than new gas. In setting the target of 100% recovery of hazardous waste by 2028, the current regulatory framework and internal waste management practices have been considered, in line with the environmental impact reduction objectives. The target is closely linked to the management of resource inflows and outflows, in line with the principles of circular economy. The use of regenerated SF6 gas reduces the dependence on new gas, optimising the efficiency of the resources already available. With respect to outflows, the recovery of hazardous waste and, more generally, correct waste management, contributes to ensuring a circular and efficient production model. In particular, with respect to the waste target, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, reference is made to the recycling stage, while for the recovery of SF6 gas, the target refers to the first of the five stages of the hierarchy, i.e. prevention. The targets covered by the Sustainability Plan and described herein are voluntary in nature and no absolute priority has been set for their achievement, except for possible milestones in the plan as shown in the table. Regarding the process for defining and updating objectives, monitoring related performance, and employee involvement, please refer to the section “2024–2028 Sustainability Plan Update”.

Circular economy is found in multiple aspects of the production cycle of goods or services and is now defined by a sound regulatory framework, established at European level by the Circular Economy Action Plan and at national level by the National Strategy for the Circular Economy. Furthermore, UNI TS 11820, the first technical specification for measuring the circularity of a company was published in 2022 ( updated in 2024). The study on energy and material flows was conducted in 2024 and focused mainly on the grid assets managed by Terna Rete Italia S.p.A.. It covered the upstream value chain, analysing 2023 stocks of materials comprising grid assets, and the downstream supply chain, examining the residual useful life, hence, the future needs in terms of replacement of assets and materials to be included in the disposal/recovery cycle. The geographical scope of the action is limited to Italy, given the nature of Terna Group’s business and the focus on Italy’s grid assets. The stakeholders involved include both internal functions (purchasing, engineering, environmental management) and external actors, such as suppliers and academic partners, with which the Group collaborates to develop advanced circularity measurement methodologies. Energy flow analysis was used to examine changes in consumption over the years between different consumption sites (electricity substations, buildings, etc.). The circularity level was calculated using a specially developed tool and took into account a number of indicators, some of which will be further refined in 2025 to improve the representativeness of the figure. Measurement will continue with the aim of broadening the engagement of further business areas and stakeholders in order to consolidate a structured approach to circularity management. The indicators for the calculation of circularity, defined and developed based on the UNI TS 11820 technical specification, adapted to the business context, considered the results of the analysis of energy and material flows, in addition to a series of additional information such as percentages of sorted waste, energy classifications of all buildings, assets and infrastructures that provide for circular end-of-life management solutions, critical raw material inputs from recycling and/ or recovery and/or by-products.

These activities require a substantial amount of capital goods, such as power lines (pylons, conductors, insulators), transformer substations (transformers, circuit breakers, other equipment) and control systems. Terna does not use raw materials, but does purchase finished products (electrical equipment, conductors, tools and other components). An estimate of the materials contained in the main products purchased is shown in the table below. Amounts have been estimated taking into account the average material content of the various products purchased in the year referred to. The bulk of the materials used are steel (pylons) and aluminium and copper (conductors and cables). MAIN MATERIALS U.M. 2024 Steel tonnes 16,519 Aluminium 9,657 Porcelain 277 Copper 7,639 Glass 2,079 Dielectric oil 1,310 of which vegetable oil 182 Polymers 413 Total 37,894 PRODUCTS AND TECHNICAL MATERIALS U.M. 2024 Biological products and materials tonnes 37,712 Total 182 Totale 37,894 The estimation process starts with the calculation of the weight, expressed in tonnes, of the quantities of goods purchased for electricity substations (e.g. transformers, arresters, etc.) and power lines (e.g. carpentry, insulators, etc.). Purchases relate to activation letters and terminated contracts issued in the reporting year. Based on the list of purchased supplies and the main raw material for each supply, the main raw material for each supply is calculated, matching a percentage of the main raw material. Similarly, with respect to substation supplies, the unit weight in tonnes is estimated based on the list of machine types, using the number of machines purchased. For example, in order to calculate the supply of circuit breakers, their main raw material is considered - in this case, porcelain - and the weight of the entire supply of circuit breakers is subsequently multiplied by the percentage of porcelain normally contained in an individual circuit breaker, generating the value in tonnes of the porcelain relating to the supply of all circuit breakers. This procedure must be repeated for all items, except for some substation supplies. These require a more detailed bill of materials, but use the same calculation methodology. These items include: “ATR 250 (400/155-135 kV)” green transformers; 420 kV circuit breakers; current and voltage transformers and arresters. MDR-M < E5-4 <"

The main actions carried out by the Group during the year in order to pursue the targets set out in its waste management policies are as follows: Tracking and reporting on waste using the Atlantide software As part of the project to digitalise its processes, in 2024, Terna S.p.A. and Terna Rete Italia S.p.A. introduced a system to support the administrative management of waste in order to increase efficiency and achieve a high level of control. This need will also combine with the entry into effect of the new National Electronic Waste Traceability Register (RENTRI). Indeed, the software will allow interoperability with the RENTRI information system, facilitating the communication of waste traceability data from Terna to RENTRI. This new software will also enable Terna to extract more reliable and accurate reports on waste that also provide greater control over waste recycling rates. Transforming used PPE (clothing, shoes and helmets) into secondary raw materials Optimising the recycling of waste by transforming Terna S.p.A.’s and Terna Rete Italia S.p.A.’s PPE into second raw materials began in 2021 and is still in place as part of the collaboration with ESO Benefit. ESO stands out from other market operators which collect the same type of waste thanks to its expertise in the back-to-work services provided to companies that use PPE, such as work clothes, helmets and shoes. The service provides for the collection and recycling of PPE that, once worn out and having reached the end of its life cycle, is sent to a recycling process. The back-to-work service enables companies to optimise their separate waste collection, transforming waste into new resources and adopting good corporate social responsibility practices. In particular, the material collected by ESO and correctly characterised is not finally disposed of by incineration (as is the case for the vast majority of this type of waste). In fact, it is sent to treatment processes that transform it into secondary raw materials (SRM). Specifically, the recycled part of shoes may be transformed into an anti-shock floor which, for example, is particularly suitable for children’s playgrounds. The pilot use will be agreed directly with ESO, until 2028, based on the waste recycled in recent years."
"268 TERNA S.P.A. AND TERNA GROUP | 2024 ANNUAL REPORT Metrics and targets related to the promotion of circular economy Goals of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan As part of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the Terna Group has defined a series of specific targets to assess the progress with respect to the circular economy and the related material impacts, also with a view to ensuring a clear path towards achieving the objectives identified by the thematic policies adopted by the Group and reported on previously. Objectives of the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan update - ‘Sustainable value chain’ Pillar OBJECTIVE TARGET BOUNDARY METRIC AND RELATED UNIT OF MEASUREMENT MILESTONE 2025 2026 2027 2028 Recupero e rigenerazione del gas SF6 Gruppo Terna Kg di gas SF6 rigenerato 42.000 47.000 52.000 57.000 The above target was developed and set out, for the first time, in the 2024-2028 Sustainability Plan, the first to be integrated with the Industrial Plan. The base year to be considered for the formulation of the target is therefore, as a rule, 2024. It is therefore necessary to wait for the 2025 final balance for a proper assessment of performance and trends. The updated Sustainability Plan, whose guidelines were shared at the Sustainability Governance and Scenarios Board Committee and also represented within the Industrial Plan document submitted to the board of directors, did not require any particular changes in terms of metrics or methodologies for this objective. It should be noted that in 2024, 33,036 kg of SF6 gas were regenerated, a year for which a target value had not been set. The Sustainability Plan includes another target which is relevant to resource outflows, namely the 100% recovery of hazardous waste by 2028. For this target, which is linked to the “Waste” reference metric reported below, no significant Milestones are currently planned within the plan’s timeframe, and developments regarding the target’s applicability scope, originally conceived for the Electrical Perimeter, will be monitored within the dedicated Coordination Group.The above targets are consistent with those included in the Circular Economy Roadmap and Terna Group’s Integrated Management System Policy, and comply with the UNI ISO 14001 standard. These targets were drawn up taking into account the main international frameworks (e.g. UNI EN ISO 14001:2015) and also take into account the requirements expressed by the various rating agencies specialised in sustainability topics. The target for SF6 gas was defined based on the projected need for this gas over the next few years. Terna’s use of regenerated gas complies with Regulation (EU) 2024/573, which aims to promote the use of regenerated gas rather than new gas. In setting the target of 100% recovery of hazardous waste by 2028, the current regulatory framework and internal waste management practices have been considered, in line with the environmental impact reduction objectives. The target is closely linked to the management of resource inflows and outflows, in line with the principles of circular economy. The use of regenerated SF6 gas reduces the dependence on new gas, optimising the efficiency of the resources already available. With respect to outflows, the recovery of hazardous waste and, more generally, correct waste management, contributes to ensuring a circular and efficient production model. In particular, with respect to the waste target, in accordance with the waste hierarchy, reference is made to the recycling stage, while for the recovery of SF6 gas, the target refers to the first of the five stages of the hierarchy, i.e. prevention. The targets covered by the Sustainability Plan and described herein are voluntary in nature and no absolute priority has been set for their achievement, except for possible milestones in the plan as shown in the table. Regarding the process for defining and updating objectives, monitoring related performance, and employee involvement, please refer to the section “2024–2028 Sustainability Plan Update”.

AND TERNA GROUP Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 The value creation strategy Remarks on the results and other information Certification of Sustainability Statement The independent report on the limited audit of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement 2024 Annexes The Terna Group The Terna Group’s business Metrics related to the promotion of circular economy Resource inflows Terna Group’s material resource inflows are those arising from the development and maintenance of the NTG. These activities require a substantial amount of capital goods, such as power lines (pylons, conductors, insulators), transformer substations (transformers, circuit breakers, other equipment) and control systems. Terna does not use raw materials, but does purchase finished products (electrical equipment, conductors, tools and other components). An estimate of the materials contained in the main products purchased is shown in the table below. Amounts have been estimated taking into account the average material content of the various products purchased in the year referred to. The bulk of the materials used are steel (pylons) and aluminium and copper (conductors and cables). MAIN MATERIALS U.M. 2024 Steel tonnes 16,519 Aluminium 9,657 Porcelain 277 Copper 7,639 Glass 2,079 Dielectric oil 1,310 of which vegetable oil 182 Polymers 413 Total 37,894 PRODUCTS AND TECHNICAL MATERIALS U.M. 2024 Biological products and materials tonnes 37,712 Total 182 Totale 37,894 The estimation process starts with the calculation of the weight, expressed in tonnes, of the quantities of goods purchased for electricity substations (e.g. transformers, arresters, etc.) and power lines (e.g. carpentry, insulators, etc.). Purchases relate to activation letters and terminated contracts issued in the reporting year. Based on the list of purchased supplies and the main raw material for each supply, the main raw material for each supply is calculated, matching a percentage of the main raw material. Similarly, with respect to substation supplies, the unit weight in tonnes is estimated based on the list of machine types, using the number of machines purchased. For example, in order to calculate the supply of circuit breakers, their main raw material is considered - in this case, porcelain - and the weight of the entire supply of circuit breakers is subsequently multiplied by the percentage of porcelain normally contained in an individual circuit breaker, generating the value in tonnes of the porcelain relating to the supply of all circuit breakers. This procedure must be repeated for all items, except for some substation supplies. These require a more detailed bill of materials, but use the same calculation methodology. These items include: “ATR 250 (400/155-135 kV)” green transformers; 420 kV circuit breakers; current and voltage transformers and arresters. MDR-M < E5-4 <"

Only special waste produced during the production processes is included, not waste produced by offices (urban waste). With respect to the Group companies operating in Italy, as it is not currently possible to provide accurate figures on waste recovery and disposal methods, an estimation was made based on the latest publicly available figures included in the 2024 Special Waste Report issued by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA). In particular, the types of waste disposed of and recovered were obtained by multiplying the total waste disposed of and recovered by the Italian companies, by the % weight of disposal types on the total waste disposed of and the % weight of recovery types on the total waste recovered, respectively, as per ISPRA’s Special Waste Report. With respect to the disposal types included in the Special Waste Report, the following items were considered: 1) incineration: special waste for incineration and co-incineration, 2) landfill: waste disposed of through landfill; 3) other disposal operations: hazardous waste subject to other disposal operations. With respect to the types of recovery included in the Special Waste Report, the following items were considered: 1) preparation for re-use: no waste for re-use was identified, 2) recycling: special waste classified from R2 to R9, 3) Other recovery operations: special waste classified from R10 to R12. The main special hazardous waste generated in the operation of Terna’s power lines and substations are metallic waste; batteries, dielectric oils and oily emulsions. Terna Rete Italia S.p.A. generates over 90% of the Group’s hazardous waste. The main special non-hazardous waste generated relates to machinery, equipment, supports, conductors, cables and packaging. In 2024, the LT Group generated more than half of the non-hazardous waste from EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) activities in connection with the operation of third-party photovoltaic plants (revamped plants and new plants built). In particular, these include photovoltaic modules and equipment, such as switchboards and inverters which serve the photovoltaic system. The main waste materials are metals (mainly steel) and wooden packaging. MDR-M > E5-5 > OTHER DOCUMENTS SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT ON OPERATIONS"
