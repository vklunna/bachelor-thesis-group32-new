As nature-related impacts and dependencies are the ultimate sources of the | environmental transition and physical risks, the assessment of the environmental risk is designed as follows. | The assessment of the environmental transition risks corresponds to the evaluation of the environmental | impacts. The assessment of the environmental physical risks corresponds to the evaluation of the | environmental dependencies. | Systemic risks, such as ecosystem collapse risk and aggregated risk, are considered as part of the data | sources used for the assessment. ING assesses the 'Impacts on the extent and condition of ecosystems' from | UNEP-FI, which is described as the ability of an industry 'to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of | terrestrial and non-terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and | reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss' (and the impact could be positive or negative). ING uses | the 'Impacts on ecosystem services' with the BIA-GBS metrics. They describe the changes caused by | corporate businesses to biodiversity loss. The severity of the driver impact on nature is expressed in Mean | Species Abundance (MSA) that reflects the biodiversity intactness. | Used to assess sectors' association with negative impacts and dependencies on the sustainability matters. | Overview of external data sources | The DMA leverages on renowned external data sources, whose reliability is supported by scientific research, | consistent with known benchmarks, business standards and formats. Additionally, internal data (risk- and | HR-related), voluntary reports (human rights report, Climate Progress Update) and other external regulatory | disclosures are used. All data is subject to quality checks, in particular with regard to completeness, | uniqueness, integrity, accuracy and timeliness. To assess sectors’ association with negative impacts and | dependency on the various sustainability matters, multiple data sources are used, as summarised in the | below table per sustainability matter. | ▪ Eurostat: The annual enterprise statistics for special aggregates of activities Eurostat (2023) is a | compilation of statistics providing a comprehensive overview of the economic landscape.
