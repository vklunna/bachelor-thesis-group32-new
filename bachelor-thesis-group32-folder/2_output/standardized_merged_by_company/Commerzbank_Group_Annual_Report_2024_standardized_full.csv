,"stakeholders include other banks, scientists, representatives of non- | governmental organisations and the Commerzbank Sustainability | Advisory Board, which also represents the Bank’s customer per- | spective. The internal stakeholders surveyed were taken from Group | Sustainability Management, Group Strategy, Group Organisation, | Legal, Human Resources, Corporate Clients segment, and Private | and Small-Business Customers segment. Stakeholders from the two | largest subsidiaries, Commerz Real and mBank, were also involved. | Further analysis of the negative and positive impacts is per- | formed independently of the outcome of the initial assessment.

This ap- | proach facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the complex | interactions that influence Commerzbank’s business strategy. To | make sure the relationships were depicted accurately between im- | pacts, on the one hand, and the risks and opportunities potentially | arising from these impacts, on the other, the corresponding assess- | ment was carried out by the respective responsible experts. This | ensured that the reasons behind assessing the impacts were also | taken into account when assessing the risks and opportunities. | The systematic assessment of risks and opportunities is a central | component of Group sustainability reporting. This assessment was | performed in multiple stages to ensure that we fully understand the | material impacts of our business activities on the environment, so- | ciety and economy. As stipulated in the implementation guidance, | the likelihood of occurrence was determined using a five-point scale: | low, medium, high, very high and actual. The scale of the impact | was also assessed using a five-point scale: minimal to none, low, | medium, high and very high. The type of impact was determined | across three thematic dimensions: environment, social and business | conduct. | Input parameters | the Bank’s Environmental Risk Control department, based primarily | In order to provide as complete an overview as possible of all po- | tentially applicable IROs, different perspectives were taken into ac- | count when defining the IROs. A list of suggestions for all standards | was developed by the central CSRD project to aid in identifying im- | pacts, risks and opportunities. Consistency in reporting is promoted | by including new topics introduced by the ESRS and taking into ac- | count existing content from other reports, supplemented by sug- | gestions from a market comparison on Group sustainability | fleshed out with additional IROs to ensure it provides a complete | picture.

For this 82 82 | purpose, we consult applicable legal provisions as well as regula- 82 82 | tory requirements such as the EU Biodiversity Strategy; the Zero 82 82 | Pollution Action Plan for Air, Water and Soil; the EU Circular Econ- 82 82 | omy Action Plan; and the German Biodiversity Strategy.
