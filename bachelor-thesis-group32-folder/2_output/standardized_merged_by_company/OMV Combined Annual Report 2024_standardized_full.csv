The integration with internal functions is reinforced through a cross- | functional Risk Committee chaired by the OMV CFO, involving senior management members.

The process also involves regular | discussions by the Executive Board regarding environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations, | as well as progress on sustainability-related targets.

The Remuneration Committee is authorized to determine the | Executive Board’s remuneration, including the structure of the remuneration system and actual target achievement. | The Executive Board remuneration consists of fixed and variable remuneration elements. Selected employees at | senior management level are also eligible to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). The variable | remuneration – LTIP and the annual bonus – includes performance criteria related to the Company’s sustainability | and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions performance. Long-term shareholder and other stakeholder interests are | reflected in the performance-related remuneration, which includes both long-term and short-term elements. | General Meeting in June 2022 and was effective in 2023. It sets out GHG and ESG targets as forming part of the | annual bonus and LTIP. The proportion of variable remuneration linked to sustainability-related targets comprises | 15% of the annual bonus, based on achieving the defined reduction in net absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, | and 30% of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), based on achieving ESG targets. These ESG targets are to reduce | the net carbon intensity of energy supply (weighted with 20%) and improve diversity at the OMV Group (weighted | with 10%). The GHG targets in the annual bonus (i.e., reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and the LTIP (i.e., reducing | the carbon intensity of energy supply) are clearly linked and directly derived from the OMV GHG emissions | reduction targets for 2030 and the required reduction pathways up to 2030 compared to the base year 2019. This | means the achievement of the GHG targets set out in the annual bonus and the LTIP requires OMV to implement | the defined decarbonization pathway to achieve its 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets, which include the | reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30%, the reduction of Scope 3 emissions by 20%, and the | reduction of the carbon intensity of energy supply by 20% – all compared to the base year 2019. | criteria derived from OMV’s Strategy 2030, among which are strategic GHG emissions reduction KPIs that steer | OMV’s decarbonization actions up to 2030. These include the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and the | reduction of the carbon intensity of energy supply. The Remuneration Committee chooses and approves the | specific ESG targets and their weighting for each LTIP tranche based on this catalog. The catalog is reviewed and, if | needed, updated each year following a process defined and owned by the OMV People & Culture department. GHG | emissions reduction will always constitute an ESG target in the LTIP. GHG and ESG targets and their weighting are | published in the Remuneration Report for the grant year, which can be found on the / OMV website. Based on | predefined criteria (e.g., fatalities, TRIR, process safety) and in comparison to industry benchmarks, a health and | safety malus of between 0.8 and 1.0 is applied to the overall target achievement for both the annual bonus and the | LTIP. In the event of severe incidents, the Remuneration Committee may reduce the payout to zero. This malus | considers OMV’s commitment to health and workplace safety. An external review of actual target achievement is | performed by OMV’s auditor, and the results are communicated to the Remuneration Committee and Supervisory | Board. | OMV Combined Annual Report 2024 | Shareholders Directors’ Report | Sustainability Reporting | end-to-end processes to ensure the integrity and reliability of both our financial and sustainability reporting. Our | commitment to maintaining high standards of governance and transparency is reflected in our active | implementation of a four lines of defense model. Operational management forms the first line of defense by owning | and managing risks. The second line includes the Risk Management, Corporate ICS, and Compliance functions that | oversee and monitor these practices. Our Internal Audit function serves as the third line of defense, providing | independent assurance on the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls. Additionally, OMV views | external auditors as a fourth line of defense, ensuring close alignment with ICS-related topics. This approach | ensures that risk management and internal control responsibilities are clearly defined and distributed across the | organization to maintain the integrity and accuracy of sustainability data and to mitigate any risks that may be | related to our sustainability reporting process. | OMV’s sustainability reporting process is defined and owned by Group Sustainability. It is evaluated on an annual | basis and if there have been any changes, the process is updated. The process is subject to both internal and | external audits to ensure that it is effective. Additionally, in alignment with the evolving regulatory landscape, OMV | has recently established internal controls specifically designed for EU Taxonomy compliant reporting. These | controls ensure that our sustainability activities and disclosures meet the stringent requirements set forth by the | EU, thereby enhancing the credibility and transparency of our sustainability reporting. | risks that could affect our financial and sustainability reporting. We perform annual risk assessments to pinpoint | potential risks of material misstatements based on criteria such as materiality, process complexity, and likelihood of | errors. OMV’s internal control framework encompasses policies, procedures, and controls that are reviewed annually | and updated to address emerging risks and comply with regulatory requirements. Adhering to the principles in the | Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process, risks related to sustainability reporting are prioritized based on | their potential impact on regulatory compliance, our strategic objectives, and stakeholder expectations. OMV’s | sustainability reporting process will be reassessed in 2025 to make all the necessary updates related to the | requirements outlined in the ESRS. This will also include a process on the materiality assessment. Additional internal | controls to meet the minimum ESRS disclosure requirements will be implemented gradually. The initial focus is on | implementing robust internal controls for quantitative data related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, health, | safety, security, and environment (HSSE), own workforce, human rights, and sustainable procurement. This phased | approach allows us to build a solid foundation for comprehensive and accurate sustainability reporting. | quantitative data, incompleteness of data, and untimely delivery of data. To mitigate these risks, several controls | are implemented. Data validation controls are put in place to ensure accuracy through automated checks and | manual reviews. Data completeness controls are implemented via comprehensive data collection procedures and | regular audits to ensure all necessary data is captured. Timeliness controls are established by setting strict | reporting timelines and monitoring adherence to deadlines. The implementation of additional controls for | sustainability reporting is in its early stages and will be gradually developed to include comprehensive internal | (ICS) continuously reassesses risks through regular reviews, conducted every three years for all end-to-end | processes within its scope, including the sustainability reporting process. However, if a major change occurs during | this period, an ad hoc review is conducted, and the three-year cycle restarts from that point. Internal controls are | embedded into these processes to ensure comprehensive risk management. When a new risk emerges, it is | assessed by the relevant function and, if deemed significant, an internal control is designed and integrated into the | Company’s internal control system. | OMV Combined Annual Report 2024",Governance Financial Statements Further Information nan 110 110 | nan 110 110 | 110.0 110 110 | Governance Financial Statements Further Information nan 111 111 | nan 111 111 | 111.0 111 111 | Governance Financial Statements Further Information nan 113 113 | nan 113 113 | 113.0 113 113,110,"10,15,20,30",
