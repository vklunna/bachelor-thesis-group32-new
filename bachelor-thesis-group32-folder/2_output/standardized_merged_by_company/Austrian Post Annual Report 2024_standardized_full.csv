This is based on Austrian Post’s | financial reporting. | The calculation of category 4) Upstream transpor- | tation and distribution is based on the distance-based | method.

Austrian Post is | heavily reliant on the availability of trustworthy primary data.","nan 52 52 | Page nan 52 52 | 50.0 52 52 | 88.0 52 52 | Corporate Governance Management Report Consolidated Financial Statements Information nan 53 53 | Page nan 53 53 | 123.0 53 53 | Page nan 54 54 | 163.0 54 54 | The materiality assessment described in nan 54 54 | nan 54 54 | upstream and downstream value chain.
