,"Annual Report 2024 | • | Sustainability Statement | sustainability matters for which we do not have a formal policy in place. | mapping | This section provides a mapping of where we have covered the relevant | ESRS disclosure requirements relating to our material impacts, risks and | opportunities throughout this Sustainability Statement. | We determined the material information to be disclosed in our | Sustainability Statement by applying the criteria outlined in ESRS 1, | section 3.2, which focuses on material matters and materiality of | information. Specifically, we used paragraph 31 of ESRS 1 to assess the | significance of information and whether it would influence the decision | making needs of users of the Sustainability Statement. For example, we | consider key policies and key actions to be those that drive significant, | material change regarding the sustainability topics that matter most for | our stakeholders. | Consolidated Financial Statements. | Entity-specific disclosures | behind our metrics in each section. Unless otherwise specified in the | Given Adyen’s business model, value-chain positioning, and our | distinctive approach to building our business for the long term, a number | of our material sustainability matters identified through the DMA process | are entity-specific. Sustainability matters such as social impact and | Impact technology are specific to Adyen as they represent our unique | opportunity to create positive impact through the combined strengths of | our talent, technology, and network. Further, as ESRS sector-specific | standards are not yet available — and do not yet capture the breadth or | specificity of activities within our industry — we have identified a number | of entity-specific matters that relate to the nature of our sector, such as | anti-financial crime, information security, and data privacy for which | topical standards are not yet available. | Although we recognize that entity-specific disclosures may limit | comparability between undertakings, we have reported on six entity | specific matters, consisting of several metrics. These entity-specific | metrics are included to support our stakeholders to better understand | our impacts and performance on the related sustainability matter. | In line with the relevant application requirements of ESRS, we have | considered the relevance and comparability of these disclosures. Some | general notes hold across all disclosures, including entity specific ones: | Annual Report 2024 | ESRS content index Disclosure | ESRS 2 - General disclosures | (b) DEI Sustainability Statement - Diversity within our workforce (c) Corporate Governance report | administrative, management, and supervisory bodies | Report | DEI Sustainability Statement - ‘Our approach to prevention of discrimination and channels to raise concerns’ | Company culture Sustainability Statement - ‘Adyen Formula’ Company culture Sustainability Statement - ‘Normal Course of Life’ | Company culture Sustainability Statement - ‘Remuneration Policy’ Learning & development Sustainability Statement - ‘Our policy and approach’ | survey’ Learning & development Sustainability Statement - ‘Stakeholder consideration and | engagement’ | Annual Report 2024 | Business Conduct Sustainability Statement - ‘Protection of whistleblowers’ | those actions | E1- Climate change | Entity specific disclosures | Social impact | ESRS 2 | Impact technology | Annual Report 2024 | ESRS 2 | Company culture Sustainability Statement | Responsible tax | Information security | Data privacy | Anti-financial crime","111 111 111 | Policies and approach: Since we prioritize flexibility and The following sustainability matters are entity-specific, and do not use 111 111 | responsiveness over rigid guidelines and processes, there are some any ESRS topical disclosure requirements but rather follow the entity- 111 111 | specific disclosure requirements.
