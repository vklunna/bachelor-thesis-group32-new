Therefore, no further expenditure is disclosed in detail, taking | into account, among other things, that the distribution of resources may change based on market dynamics, | regulatory developments and the outcome of internal assessments, including the double materiality assessment. | Use of estimates | made, reference should be made to the chapter “Environmental information”, in particular the section on “Climate | change – Metrics related to climate change”. In addition, estimates were made for resource inflows and waste. For | information about the sources of uncertainty and the assumptions made, reference should be made to the chapter | “Environmental information”, in particular the section on “Promoting the circular economy – Metrics related to the | promotion of circular economy”. Further specifications on this are appropriately covered in the relevant sections. | Finally, with regard to the value chain, estimates were applied to determine certain Scope 3 categories. | In order to continuously improve the accuracy of representation, the Terna Group is committed to periodically | updating the methodologies and data underlying the calculation of reported metrics. | Furthermore, the reporting of forward-looking information, such as targets and future objectives, may be subject | to variations based on market and context dynamics, regulatory developments, and the outcomes of internal | assessments. | Information incorporated by reference | In relation to information incorporated by reference, the Group provides appropriate evidence of the section of the | Consolidated Sustainability Statement and/or Report on Operations to which reference is made.
