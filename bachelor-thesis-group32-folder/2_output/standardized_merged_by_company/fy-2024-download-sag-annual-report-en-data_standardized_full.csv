The interests of the relevant stakeholder | groups have therefore been incorporated into the process for identifying and assessing the material impacts, | risks and opportunities associated with resource use and circular economy and thus have been taken into | account. | In the above-mentioned double materiality assessment, the material impacts, risks and opportunities | associated with business conduct were identified and assessed with the involvement of various internal | experts, taking into account the company’s business model and activities and the geographical locations of | its activities. | and marine resources | In the double materiality assessment mentioned above, the impacts, risks and opportunities associated with | water and marine resources and with biodiversity and ecosystems were also examined. Primarily physical | risks as well as systemic risks and transition risks were taken into consideration. | For the company’s own operations, | environmental management systems of the production sites was mainly consulted and an examination was | made of the extent to which there are indications as to whether these contribute to the direct factors | influencing the loss of biodiversity or whether the sites have impacts on the status of species, on the extent | and status of ecosystems or on ecosystem services. As a result, Sartorius has not identified any of its own sites | in or near biodiversity sensitive areas. Therefore, no remedial action relating to biodiversity needs to be | taken. Due to the operational activities of Sartorius, there are therefore no significant impacts that have a | negative impact on areas with biodiversity in need of protection. | The company also carried out a water stress analysis for the relevant production sites. Furthermore, Sartorius | does not currently have any sites in high water stress areas as defined by the “Aqueduct” water risk atlas of the | World Resources Institute (WRI) where there is a dependency on water (e.g. in the production process). | At present, there are also no significant dependencies on biodiversity and water resources with regard to the | consumption of materials and raw materials along the entire value chain, as the company currently only uses | insignificant quantities of biological materials and does not purchase any significant quantities of water. | As regards the upstream value chain, there is currently no comprehensive information available that would | allow an assessment of the negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems or on water and marine resources. | The evaluation of sustainability-related supplier monitoring by an external provider has not revealed any | indications of incidents relating to water and marine resources, biodiversity or ecosystems. | As regards the downstream value chain, information on customers available to the company from product | management and sales was taken into account. According to this information, no significant impacts on water | resources and biodiversity have been identified. | Local communities have not yet been consulted. | As a result, Sartorius has come to the conclusion that there were no significant actual or potential impacts, | risks or opportunities relating to either topic in the reporting year. | Sartorius | The company will regularly monitor the topics of biodiversity and water and marine resources as part of its | sustainability reporting in order to identify potential changes or new risks at an early stage. | Integration of the results of the double materiality assessment into corporate processes | The entire double materiality assessment process and its results are closely coordinated and interlinked with | Corporate Risk Management. Risk | inventory. Close cooperation between Corporate Sustainability and the central risk management team also | ensured that, where impacts and dependencies were identified, a review was carried out to determine whether | these gave rise to financial risks and/or opportunities. The assessment criteria used for the double materiality | assessment are also coordinated with Corporate Risk Management. During the validation phase, the | assessments were also subjected to a final comparison with the company’s previous risk profile. In addition, | the material sustainability risks are part of the company’s risk inventory, ensuring that sustainability risks have | the same importance as other risks in the company. | Sartorius did not | opportunity management processes is not yet relevant. | Prioritization and monitoring of sustainability issues | The Corporate Sustainability department is responsible for the entire process of identifying, evaluating, | prioritizing and monitoring material sustainability | interlinking it with other corporate processes such as the human rights due diligence process, risk and | opportunity management and other relevant processes.
