,"Sustainability Statement / Sustainability notes | Accounting policies and notes, cont. | When it comes to our annual growing footprint (dynamic impacts), the BFA shows that almost 90% is connected to | climate change impacts (BFA 2022). Our operations impact both terrestrial, aquatic and marine | ecosystems due to land and sea use, site constructions and hydrological disturbances. Looking at static impacts (historical | transformations), around 30% is due to our own operations, | mainly linked to land occupation needed for the distribution | grids. Considering the investments needed in grids and fossil | free generation for the energy transition, land use could increase | significantly towards 2040 compared to the 2019 baseline. | The assessment also shows significant static land use foot- | print from fuel and non-fuel supply chains. Aquatic static impacts are also relevant, mainly through | hydrological disturbance linked to hydro power operations. However, data refinements are required e.g. since the hydro- | power module in Global Biodiversity Score tool was still experi- mental at the time of the assemssment. A weakness in the | methodology was also that marine areas were not fully included | at the time of the assessment. We are however aware of marine impacts at project level and we invest in R&D activities to fur- | ther study how marine species and habitats are impacted by | offshore wind developments. | The risk assessment on page 101 was evaluated based on the sub-risks and underlying data presented in Table 5. | One exception is concrete for which no data were available | in the consulted source reports.
