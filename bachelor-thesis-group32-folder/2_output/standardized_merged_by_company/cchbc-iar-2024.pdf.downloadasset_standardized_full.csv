During the mid-term and long-term water risk assessment processes, | we evaluate the future trends that might impact | the current water risks. The starting point for the | climate change impact on water resources is related to water availability.

This allows | us to calculate the future source water utilisation | rate. If this value exceeds 100%, it means we need to optimise and expand our water infrastructure | to ensure future available water volumes for our | production needs. We also quantify the climate | change impact on water resources availability as financial risk. We specifically quantify the | additional operational and capital expenditure we | need to increase water availability for the climate | scenarios of 2030 and 2040, under two different climate scenarios.
