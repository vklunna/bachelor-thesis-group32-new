,"Complementary disclosure requirements for specific topical ESRS on the description of the processes to identify and assess | material impacts, risks and opportunities: | Climate | change | as representing a significant proportion of total emissions. | Share of Scope 3 Category 11 - Use of Sold Products emission in total emissions >90% | The Company also identified climate related risks following a TCFD-aligned approach, that included a | screening of its sites and assets potential vulnerabilities to climate hazards (see “– 6.2.2.3 Description of | the processes to identify and assess material climate-related impacts, risks and opportunities (ESRS 2 | IRO-1) and Material impacts, risks and opportunities and their interaction with strategy and business | model (ESRS 2 SBM-3)”. Such analyses considered time horizons, assumptions and scenarios (see “– | description. | Pollution | declarations made by its sites to local authorities in the context of the European Pollutant Release and | Transfer Register (E-PRTR) regulation. | Number of facilities exceeding the 100 tonnes threshold for VOC emissions listed 1 | in the E-PRTR regulation Annex II. (Hamburg) | Impacts in the upstream and downstream value chain have been assessed using the Life Cycle Analysis | (LCA) approach, such as the one in relation with kerosene production. For SOC/SOVHC, risks and | opportunities have also been assessed using the register of the Company’s top company risks, according | to the ERM process. This risk notably applies to aircraft manufacturing and is therefore connected to all | sites with such industrial operations and handling chemicals. The materiality assessment did not involve | direct consultations with affected communities. | Water and | marine | resources | where risks of business disruption linked to restrictions on the use of water are the most significant. This | analysis is based inter alia on the World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas; this analysis | was last updated with the August 2023 update of the Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas (version 4.0), using the | “baseline” data as well as the 2030 scenarios. This analysis allowed to identify that the Company operates | facilities located in high or extremely high water stress areas in Chile, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, | Mexico, Morocco, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia, UK, US. It includes sites | from Commercial Aircraft, Airbus Helicopters and Airbus Defence and Space. As for ESRS E2, impacts in | the upstream and downstream value chain have been assessed using the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) | approach. The materiality assessment did not involve consultations with affected communities. | Biodiversity | significant drivers of biodiversity loss: changing use of sea and lands, direct exploitation of organisms, | climate change, pollution, and invasive non-native species. Using these five drivers is also prescribed as a | impacts. It considered a number of sources of information, amongst which the aircraft Life Cycle Analysis - | that notably quantifies impacts related to land use change, soil, water pollution across the value chain. | The indirect impact of climate change appeared as a salient effect on biodiversity as well the indirect | impact of aviation fuel production. | The Company has considered the proximity of its sites relative to biodiversity-sensitive areas and the | nature of operations in the value chain, including existing or potential pollution impacts. | To date, the Company has identified limited dependencies on biodiversity and ecosystems within its value | chain, including by screening its resource inflows and considering its business model, and primarily due to | the fact that manufacturing processes mostly rely on mineral or fossil resources.This limited dependency | on ecosystem services as identified to date has not led to the identification of biodiversity-related material | transition, physical or systemic risks to the Company’s own operations. | The Company is reviewing its assessments on an ongoing basis. Going forward, specific attention will be | given to the development of SAF production, particularly those pathways that use crops as feedstock and | therefore rely on ecosystem services, striving to get a permanent understanding of SAF production | development and perspectives, including by engaging on that matter with relevant players in the SAF | value chain and industry bodies. | Beyond answering to applicable biodiversity related regulatory requirements that may imply to assess and | report to authorities deemed to represent communities’ interests, the Company did not specifically engage | with any community on biodiversity in the frame of its DMA. Nature of impacts identified, essentially linked | to indirect effects of the use of its product on climate change and of the production of kerosene on the | water resource, has not permitted identifying specific communities that would be materially affected. | Consequently no affected communities has been involved in the materiality assessment nor any priority | actions for the avoidance of impacts on ecosystem services relevant to affected communities has been | identified. The Company has identified some sites as being located near biodiversity-sensitive areas | based on whether they were subject to specific biodiversity-related obligations as per local / national | applicable regulations, or otherwise located in or directly adjacent to biodiversity-sensitive areas, including | some with manufacturing and flight test activities. | Number of sites located near biodiversity-sensitive areas 15 | None of these activities have been associated with a material negative impact on local biodiversity. As a | result, measures undertaken in the frame of addressing negative impacts on climate change were deemed | to be equally relevant for biodiversity mitigation. | Resource | use and | circular | economy | related to their sourcing, as well as related airworthiness constraints and certification requirements. It also | ran a detailed analysis of waste generated by the Company, including per nature and per site views, as | well as in the perspective of its manufacturing processes and of their improvements. The assessment was | supported by a number of stakeholders, including a third party expert organisation with experience of | identifying and addressing actual or potential impacts and engaging with potentially impacted | rightsholders. | Business | conduct | on legal entities), taking into consideration, among others, the Corruption Perception Index published by | Transparency International, the size, the activity or the interaction with third parties of the entity. It also | considered relevant statistics derived from its grievance mechanism and from the outcomes of associated | investigations. On other subtopics, the Company notably considered the amount of lobbying expenses, | the amounts spent to its suppliers, related payment terms, as well as the structure of its supply chain. | Table.
