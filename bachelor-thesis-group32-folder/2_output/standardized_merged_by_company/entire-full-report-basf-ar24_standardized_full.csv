In identifying, prioritizing and validating material sustainability-related topics, we follow the | principle of double materiality, taking into consideration financial materiality and impact materiality. The | following chapters deal with the topics, subtopics and sub-subtopics that were found to be material | information on the materiality assessment, see page 167 onward. | In some cases, we have made use of incorporation by reference to minimize redundancies. An overview | of the data points incorporated by reference can be found on page 147. As permitted by ESRS 1 | paragraph 7.7, we have opted not to disclose information relating to research and development (R&D), | know-how or the results of innovation that has commercial value and whose publication would result in a | competitive disadvantage for BASF. Time horizons specified in our Sustainability Statement are used in | accordance with the ESRS definitions. | We discuss the impacts, risks and opportunities identified in our double materiality assessment in the | sections concerning the respective topics. The section on opportunity and risk management also | and risk management system and internal controls of sustainability reporting (from page 87 onward). | When individual sustainability metrics have been estimated based on indirect sources, such as sector- | average data or other proxies, we provide more information in the respective chapters. This is also the | case when metrics have been adjusted compared with prior reporting periods or when they are subject | to measurement uncertainty. Due to rounding, individual figures may not add up exactly to the totals | shown and percentages may not correspond exactly to the figures shown. As the calculations of our | and statistics, they are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. | Our data on environmental protection and safety is collected based on the recommendations of the | International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) and the European Chemical Industry Council | (CEFIC). Data relating to the environment, health and safety (EHS) and to human resources (HR) is | recorded in a central database. The EHS data is captured for each site and company based at the | respective site; the HR data is captured for each company. Environmental data (on emissions or water | volumes, for example) is determined by measurements, calculations or estimations according to the | regulatory requirements or legal obligations. The data collection method selected depends on technical | limitations (high temperatures do not always allow the use of sensors for direct measurement), the ability | to derive data from data already collected, and the proportionality of efforts to take measurements in | relation to the emission in question (such as volume flow, operating hours). To increase the robustness of | our data, we apply a two-step process in which sustainability data is first recorded and then validated in | accordance with the principle of dual control. Additional plausibility checks are carried out by the | responsible Corporate Center units, after which the data is evaluated based on the respective | consolidation criteria and aggregated in the database. | The reporting period is the 2024 business year. We include relevant data made available up to | preparation of this report by the Board of Executive Directors at the accounts meeting on March 17, | 2025 (editorial deadline).
