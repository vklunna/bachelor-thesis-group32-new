Both individual and corporate savings registered a double-digit annual growth. After a year of contraction, the foreign exchange component returned to growth during the second half of the year, mostly driven by higher inflows from corporate segment (+42.4%* YoY at December 2024 end), while the collection in local currency kept stronger on individuals segment (+16.1%* YoY at December 2024 end). On asset quality, the Romanian banking sector remains classified into EBA’s “low risk” bucket with a level of NPL (non-performing loans) ratio <3% and NPL coverage ratio > 55%. As at December 2024 end, NPL ratio increased marginally to the level of 2.46% (vs. 2.37% at December 2023 end).

BRD Group has selected 2019 as the baseline year for its GHG emissions reduction target due to its operational stability and typical consumption levels. While 2020 was a potential candidate for the baseline, it was excluded due to the significant disruption caused by the COVID- 19 pan-demic, which led to abnormal consumption patterns and a reduction in overall operational activity.
