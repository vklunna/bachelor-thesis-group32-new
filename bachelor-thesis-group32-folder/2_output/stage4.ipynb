      "40 On deposits, the annual dynamic more than doubled as of December 2024 end compared to December 2023 end, reaching +14.3%* YoY (vs +6.0%* YoY at December 2023 end). Both individual and corporate savings registered a double-digit annual growth. After a year of contraction, the foreign exchange component returned to growth during the second half of the year, mostly driven by higher inflows from corporate segment (+42.4%* YoY at December 2024 end), while the collection in local currency kept stronger on individuals segment (+16.1%* YoY at December 2024 end). On asset quality, the Romanian banking sector remains classified into EBA’s “low risk” bucket with a level of NPL (non-performing loans) ratio <3% and NPL coverage ratio > 55%. As at December 2024 end, NPL ratio increased marginally to the level of 2.46% (vs. 2.37% at December 2023 end). NPL coverage ratio stood high at 67% at September 2024 end (vs. 65% at December 2023 end). The Romanian banking system remains well capitalized, as reflected by the solid capital adequacy ratio of 23.7% as of December 2024 end (vs. 23.6% as of December 2023 end), higher than EU average (20.1% at September 2024 end) and significantly above the overall capital requirements (17.3% as of September 2024 end). This is helped by the high rate of incorporation of profit and potentially by the new regulatory temporary treatments (implemented through art 468 and art 500a of CRR3 in July 2024. On the medium term, a potential negative factor on the capital position could be the implementation of the Basel IV directive (published as of May 2024 end), which may lead to an increase of capital requirements for Romanian banks of 3.6% of risk-weighted assets (“RWAs”) on average by the time it is fully implemented in 2028 (as per NBR Financial Stability Report, June 2024). The Romanian banking system also boasts a strong liquidity position, with a Liquidity Coverage Ratio of 254.9% as of December 2024 end (vs. 280.6% at December 2023 end), remainin\n",

This includes defining long-term objectives and targets that align with the BRD Group’s commitments to stakeholders, regulatory compliance and broader ESG priorities. The BoD ensures that sustainability considerations are integrated into the BRD Group’s strategic direction, reinforcing alignment with regulatory frameworks, stakeholder expectations and the overarching sustainability commitments of Société Générale Group (SG). Through its governance role, the BoD drives responsible decision-making, monitors progress on sustainability initiatives and ensures that BRD Group remains resilient in addressing ESG challenges and opportunities. The Executive Committee (EC) is responsible for implementing the Sustainability Strategy across all relevant business lines and functions, ensuring that the defined targets are translated into actionable plans across business units. To support these efforts, the Sustainability Committee - ESG, established in 2021 and chaired by the CEO of the Bank, functions as a permanent decisional body focused on strategic CSR and ESG analysis. The members of this committee consist of permanent members, CEO together with the rest of the EC, General Secretary, ESPIF Director, Acquisitions (ACH) Director, Executive Director Financial Risk Poling, and guests from other departments (i.e. compliance, legal, logistics, human resources, business lines).

The Management Body of BRD Group considers these impacts, risks and opportunities when overseeing the BRD Group’s strategy, major transactions and risk management processes. The BoD plays a critical role in ensuring that sustainability is embedded in strategic decision-making by aligning ESG considerations with business objectives. BRD Group’s sustainability strategy was developed through a combination of top-down strategic guidelines from SG and a bottom-up approach identifying material topics through internal analysis, such as DMA or the Business Environment Scan 2024 (BES). SG’s strategic sustainability framework is structured around four main pillars: a culture of responsibility, environmental transition, positive local impact, and responsible employment. BRD Group integrates these pillars with its internally identified sustainability-linked topics, ensuring that ESG considerations are fully embedded into its Business Strategy, Horizons 2027. As part of this process of integration, the BRD Group assesses the main risks and opportunities, their potential impact on clients and their overall business implications, ensuring a comprehensive integration of ESG factors into the long-term strategy. When overseeing major transactions and risk management, the Executive Committee evaluates how ESG risks and opportunities align with market trends, business objectives, and stakeholder expectations. ESG-related trade-offs, such as the balance between short-term operational costs and long-term sustainability goals, are carefully assessed.

      "125 BRD Group has established 2019 as the base year for its GHG emissions reduction target, with a baseline value of 20,071 tCO2 from its own operations. This baseline was determined through a comprehensive assessment of emissions data collected across all operational sites, covering both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and selected Scope 3 categories. The 2019 baseline serves as a reference point for measuring progress and tracking the effectiveness of BRD's emissions reduction initiatives. BRD Group has selected 2019 as the baseline year for its GHG emissions reduction target due to its operational stability and typical consumption levels. While 2020 was a potential candidate for the baseline, it was excluded due to the significant disruption caused by the COVID- 19 pan-demic, which led to abnormal consumption patterns and a reduction in overall operational activity. This drastic reduction in emissions and energy use in 2020 could have negatively influenced the data, making it an unreliable reference for normal operations. To ensure that the baseline is representative of typical activity levels, 2019 was chosen as it reflects a year of normal operational performance without the external disruptions that occurred in 2020. This baseline value was reviewed to ensure that it reflects BRD Group's operational emissions prior to any significant external factors or anomalies. An intensity value GHG reduction target is not yet established. The target period spans from 2019 to 2027. In 2024 it was achieved a reduction of 45% compared to the 2019 baseline.

The move to electric vehicles (EVs) and the greening of the car fleet by adopting Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) will lower emissions in Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) by replacing traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles. - Renewable Energy Adoption: One of the key actions will be to increase the use of renewable energy sources, such as solar or green electricity, in its operations, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions. This includes potential on-site renewable energy generation and the purchase of renewable energy. - Operational Optimization: BRD is enhancing operational efficiencies through technology upgrades, such as automation systems, which improve energy management and reduce overall emissions. For GHG emissions Scope 1, the greening of the car fleet (with BEVs/PHEVs) and a reduction in fossil fuel usage across BRD Group’s operations are expected to be the primary decarbonisation measures. Also, switching from fossil fuels to low-carbon or renewable fuels and enhancing energy efficiency in BRD’s building operations will also help reduce direct emissions.

This includes defining long-term objectives and targets that align with the BRD Group’s commitments to stakeholders, regulatory compliance and broader ESG priorities. The BoD ensures that sustainability considerations are integrated into the BRD Group’s strategic direction, reinforcing alignment with regulatory frameworks, stakeholder expectations and the overarching sustainability commitments of Société Générale Group (SG). Through its governance role, the BoD drives responsible decision-making, monitors progress on sustainability initiatives and ensures that BRD Group remains resilient in addressing ESG challenges and opportunities. The Executive Committee (EC) is responsible for implementing the Sustainability Strategy across all relevant business lines and functions, ensuring that the defined targets are translated into actionable plans across business units. To support these efforts, the Sustainability Committee - ESG, established in 2021 and chaired by the CEO of the Bank, functions as a permanent decisional body focused on strategic CSR and ESG analysis. The members of this committee consist of permanent members, CEO together with the rest of the EC, General Secretary, ESPIF Director, Acquisitions (ACH) Director, Executive Director Financial Risk Poling, and guests from other departments (i.e. compliance, legal, logistics, human resources, business lines). This committee’s mission is to establish the actions required to implement sustainability, climate, and environmental strategies and policies in line with Bank’s objectives, The Committee’s meetings in 2024 addressed CSRD obligations, including Sustainability Strategy.

The Communication Division, under the General Secretariat’s direct authority, manages sponsorships, community support and CSR-related communications. To ensure comprehensive risk oversight, the Compliance Committee, through the ESPIF team, provides quarterly updates to both the BoD and the EC on key environmental and social risk highlights. The Transformation Department, under the CEO’s direct authority, ensures that sustainability-related progress is tracked through established KPI indicators in line with Horizons 2025 and its extension Horizons 2027 strategic plan. Horizons 2027 (extension of Horizons 2025) represents the strategic plan of BRD, focusing on 3 main pillars: Client Centricity (growth built on all business segments, while also fostering synergies), ESG (being a responsible financier and employer) and Efficiency (by being simpler and faster, leveraging also on technology, while optimizing scarce resources and keeping a healthy risk profile). The governance structure also includes internal control mechanisms, ensuring compliance with ESG policies, risk frameworks and ethical business conduct guidelines. The implementation of ESG policies is monitored through BRD Group’s Internal Control Framework, which ensures that sustainability risks and opportunities are effectively managed and reported.

The Management Body of BRD Group considers these impacts, risks and opportunities when overseeing the BRD Group’s strategy, major transactions and risk management processes. The BoD plays a critical role in ensuring that sustainability is embedded in strategic decision-making by aligning ESG considerations with business objectives. BRD Group’s sustainability strategy was developed through a combination of top-down strategic guidelines from SG and a bottom-up approach identifying material topics through internal analysis, such as DMA or the Business Environment Scan 2024 (BES). SG’s strategic sustainability framework is structured around four main pillars: a culture of responsibility, environmental transition, positive local impact, and responsible employment. BRD Group integrates these pillars with its internally identified sustainability-linked topics, ensuring that ESG considerations are fully embedded into its Business Strategy, Horizons 2027. As part of this process of integration, the BRD Group assesses the main risks and opportunities, their potential impact on clients and their overall business implications, ensuring a comprehensive integration of ESG factors into the long-term strategy. When overseeing major transactions and risk management, the Executive Committee evaluates how ESG risks and opportunities align with market trends, business objectives, and stakeholder expectations. ESG-related trade-offs, such as the balance between short-term operational costs and long-term sustainability goals, are carefully assessed.

Additionally, members of the management bodies actively participate in annual training programs designed to enhance their understanding of material sustainability topics. In 2024, targeted training sessions were conducted on CSRD and ESRS, ensuring alignment with regulatory requirements and evolving sustainability trends. BRD Group’s Training Plan, developed annually in line with the BRD Group’s strategy and operational priorities, emphasizes upskilling and reskilling to support business needs while ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory certification requirements for key functions.

ESG and sustainability topics have been important topics in the training agenda for 2023 and 2024, with dedicated courses covering areas such as Climate Fresk, Sustainable IT Awareness, CSR Standards, Circular Economy, Environmental Crisis Management, Protecting Biodiversity and Sustainable Finance Regulations. These sessions help equip management with the necessary skills to understand, assess and address sustainability impacts, risks, and opportunities relevant to BRD Group’s operations.

The Double Materiality Assessment (DMA) was carried out in three main phases: Understanding the Context This initial phase aimed to develop a deep understanding of BRD Group’s business environment and identify potentially relevant sustainability matters. The insights gained during this phase facilitated the identification of relevant IROs by considering the Group’s operations and its broader value chain. Identifying and Assessing Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities In this phase, the Group identified and assessed IROs across a predefined list of sustainability matters, as outlined in ESRS 1 AR 16. The IROs were determined based on data collected in the first phase and assessed through two dimensions: impact materiality and financial materiality. Impacts were evaluated based on their significance to the environment and society, while risks and opportunities were analysed for their financial implications. This process led to the development of a preliminary list of material IROs, which was further refined through discussions with internal experts to ensure accuracy and relevance. Validating the Results The final phase involved an internal validation of the DMA findings with the Sustainability Committee - ESG. This step ensured the robustness and credibility of the assessment, incorporating feedback from key internal stakeholders to finalize the material IROs for reporting and strategic planning purposes. Ultimately, the results of the DMA were validated by the EC and approved by the BoD.

Emphasis was placed on the banking activities, given their substantial share in the overall BRD Group operations, accounting for nearly 94% of the BRD Group’s total activities. To ensure a detailed assessment, multiple internal sources were analysed to gain insights into the fundamental elements of BRD Group’s own operations. Additionally, feedback from key stakeholders (see ESRS 2-SBM-2.45a)—gathered through various communication channels (i.e. employee satisfaction survey, customer satisfaction survey, whistleblowing channels, complaints channels available for employees and customers, previous stakeholder engagement, etc.) available at BRD Group level—was carefully analysed to capture external perspectives and expectations related to BRD Group’s sustainability impacts. To complete the analysis, information related to business relationships along the value chain were also included in the analysis. The assessment also incorporated an evaluation of business relationships along the value chain, with a focus on BRD’s participations in other companies where operational control is not exercised. Based on the information collected during the analysis, the potentially relevant impacts were identified along BRD Group’s value chain: upstream, own operations and downstream. To identify the potentially relevant impacts related to Upstream and Own Operations value chain, BRD Group conducted an analysis of key operation aspects, including the ownership of buildings, IT equipment, car fleet, and direct resource consumption. These elements were carefully evaluated to determine their environmental and social implications within the BRD Group’s direct operations.

This structured approach facilitated the identification of a comprehensive list of relevant ESRS topics at various levels, ensuring consistency with regulatory requirements. Furthermore, the impacts associated with the identified relevant topics, sub-topics and sub-sub-topics were thoroughly assessed following the guidelines provided by ESRS 1, enabling a detailed evaluation of their significance and potential implications. The relevant impacts were assessed along the entire value chain and across the relevant time-horizon (short-term, medium-term and long-term). For this assessment, the same definitions for the time-horizons indicated within ESRS 1 were adopted. Positive and negative impacts were assessed separately in relation to the specific segments of the value chain to which they pertain. To ensure a thorough and standardized evaluation, the assessment process incorporated the key variables outlined in ESRS 1: - scale, which measures the gravity or benefit of the impact on people and the environment; - scope, which evaluates how widespread the impact is; - the irremediable character of the impact, assessing the extent to which negative effects can be mitigated or reversed; and - likelihood, which considers the probability of potential impacts occurring. For the assessment of positive actual impacts, the scale and scope were considered, whereas for potential positive impacts, the analysis also incorporated the likelihood factor. Similarly, the evaluation of actual negative impacts was based on the scale, scope, and the irremediable character of the impact, while the assessment of potential negative impacts included all four variables -scale, scope, irremediable character and likelihood.

Instead, the analysis relied on previous stakeholder consultations carried out by BRD Group, as well as feedback gathered through various communication channels available at BRD Group level (refer to disclosures under SBM2). Identification of Risks and Opportunities The process for identifying risks and opportunities closely mirrored the approach used to gain insights into BRD Group’s business context (see information reported under ESRS 2-IRO-1.53b). The collected data was integrated with insights from BRD Group's 2024 BES, as well as relevant information from other international sustainability reporting standards (SASB and GRI Standards). The BES was conducted at the BRD Group level, encompassing BRD, BRD Sogelease, and BRD Asset Management. This analysis provided valuable insights into climate and environmental risks and opportunities. For risks related to social and governance topics, BRD Group referred to the information outlined in the SASB Standards for the financial sector and GRI Standards. Given that ESG risks are analysed at an aggregated level within BRD Group's general risk management framework, the information provided by the internal risk management process lacked the necessary granularity for this analysis. The identification of the risks and opportunities took in consideration, where applicable, the connection with identified impacts. No dependencies were identified during the analysis, having in view the main activities of BRD Group.

To ensure continuous oversight and support data-driven decision- making, BRD Group will systematically track and evaluate its material sustainability- related risks and opportunities over time, aiming to mitigate negative effects and enhance positive contributions. The monitoring will primarily include periodic reviews to adapt to evolving stakeholder expectations, regulatory requirements and market dynamics; stakeholder engagement mechanisms to assess the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures and capitalize on emerging opportunities; integration with the BES; regular internal audits and ESG performance evaluations to ensure compliance with sustainability policies and identify areas for continuous improvement. Integration in the Risk Management Process At BRD Group, the processes for identifying, assessing and managing sustainability- related impacts, risks and opportunities are integrated into the overall risk management and strategic management processes.

This analysis encompassed the entire value chain of BRD Group, including upstream and downstream activities. Impacts related to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions were deemed material across upstream, own operations and downstream value chains due to their contribution to global GHG emissions and the resultant negative effects on climate change. For upstream and own operations, the assessment focused on the primary direct and indirect activities contributing to GHG emissions. Detailed information on these emission sources can be found in the disclosure E1-6. The analysis also considered the climate-related impacts associated with BRD Group's portfolio, evaluating sectoral exposures and their potential contributions to climate change. Given the unavailability of specific data on financed emissions at the time of the assessment, the analysis relied on the types of economic activities financed by BRD Group to gauge their potential climate impact. In addition to identifying negative impacts, the analysis highlighted BRD Group's positive climate contributions. These include financing renewable energy projects, promoting the adoption of clean energy technologies and supporting the transition to green technologies through tailored financial products. For further details on the identified material impacts, please refer to the disclosure ESRS 2-SBM-3.48.

BRD Group identified key transition risks and opportunities through the BES, focusing on sectors such as Energy, Construction, Automotive, Real Estate and Agriculture. The assessment considered climate-related transition events over the short, medium and long-term, evaluating their potential impact on BRD Group’s activities. The climate- related transition events were also analysed considering their potential duration and magnitude. Transition risks include new policy and regulatory constraints (e.g., \"Fit for 55\" regulations, Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030) and technological advancements requiring companies to decarbonize operations. While a 1.5°C scenario was not explicitly used in the analysis, the identified risks are consistent with this target, as they account for changes in demand for high-emission goods, increased production costs, and the potential for stranded assets in sectors like fossil fuels and heavy industry. The analysis highlighted opportunities such as financing renewable energy projects, green technologies and sustainable building materials to support clients’ decarbonization efforts. Transition risks were found to have significant implications for BRD Group’s Corporate and Retail portfolios. In the Corporate segment, policy-driven changes are expected to affect sectors like Construction and Energy, while technological advances create both risks and opportunities for clients adapting to lower-emission production methods. BRD Group supports these transitions by financing ESG/ green loans and sustainability-linked loans.

On the social front, financial decisions that fail to incorporate sustainability considerations could result in economic hardships for different stakeholders, such as farmers facing climate-induced crop losses or businesses struggling to meet regulatory compliance costs. Conversely, BRD Group's commitment to sustainability presents significant positive impacts and opportunities that contribute to environmental preservation and social well- being. By financing renewable energy projects, energy-efficient housing and sustainable agricultural practices, BRD Group supports the transition to a low-carbon economy, helping to mitigate climate change and its adverse effects on ecosystems. Investments in sustainable infrastructure and green technologies not only reduce emissions but also create economic opportunities, drive innovation, and enhance resilience against climate risks. Furthermore, BRD Group’s social initiatives, such as promoting fair wages, gender equality and financial inclusion, contribute to improved living standards, enhanced workforce productivity and social cohesion. The material impacts, risks, and opportunities (IROs) identified by BRD Group are directly connected to and originate from its strategy and business model, which are centered around providing financial services across various sectors. BRD Group’s core business activities, such as lending and investment, inherently influence environmental and social outcomes, both positively and negatively. For instance, the BRD Group's financing of high-emission industries contributes to climate change through increased GHG emissions. At the same time, BRD Group's strategic objectives on financing sustainable projects, such as renewable energy and green infrastructure, demonstrates how its business model actively seeks to mitigate these negative impacts while capitali\n",

By financing sectors with high environmental footprint, BRD Group is indirectly linked to negative impacts such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion. Conversely, BRD Group also plays a critical role in driving positive impacts by financing renewable energy projects, energy-efficient housing, and sustainable infrastructure, which support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Current Financial Effects of Material Risks and Opportunities For this first reporting cycle only a qualitative analysis was performed. The current financial effects of material risks and opportunities on BRD Group's financial position, financial performance and cash flows are estimated to be important, reflecting the evolving sustainability landscape and regulatory pressures. Compliance with evolving EU regulations such as CSRD and EU Taxonomy has resulted in increased operational costs and investments in data collection and reporting infrastructure. From a financial performance perspective, while BRD Group incurs regulatory and transition-related costs, opportunities in sustainable finance—such as the financing of renewable energy projects and climate-resilient infrastructure—are driving revenue diversification and improving market positioning. Cash flows have been affected by the need for upfront investments in sustainable finance initiatives, operational energy efficiency measures, and enhanced risk management capabilities. The definition of the transition plan until the publication of 2027 report may lead to adjustments of credit policies, particularly in sectors heavily exposed to climate transition risks. Similarly, the revaluation of loan portfolios, especially in fossil fuel- dependent industries and energy-intensive sectors, may lead to potential impairments and revised credit risk assessments.

Long-term Financial Effects: In the long term, BRD Group anticipates a good financial performance driven by the successful integration of sustainability principles into its core business model. BRD Group expects to benefit from regulatory stability, reduced risk exposure and long-term relationships with clients adopting green business models. Capital expenditures in digitalization and sustainable finance solutions will support revenue growth and operational efficiency. Furthermore, BRD Group's strategic focus on financial inclusion and access to essential services, such as healthcare and housing, will expand its market reach and drive long-term profitability. The transition to a greener economy is expected to provide resilience against economic downturns and climate-related financial risks. To support its sustainability strategy, BRD Group plans to allocate capital towards: ● Expanding its portfolio of sustainable finance, including green loans and ESG- compliant financial products26. ● Upgrading its physical infrastructure to meet energy efficiency targets. ● Investing in digitalization to enhance transparency and accessibility of financial services. To implement its strategic initiatives, BRD Group plans to secure funding through: ● Continuous focus on stable retail deposits. ● Retained earnings reinvestment to support sustainable growth initiatives. ● Strategic partnerships with development banks and international financial institutions. ● Accessing Government programs and incentives related to climate action and energy efficiency.

To conclude, BRD Group remains committed to adopting a robust transition plan by 2027 report publication. The focus in the next two years will be on: - Continuing engagement with SG to ensure alignment with its transition strategy. - Strengthening partnerships with clients and stakeholders to support their transition journeys and gradually increasing the share of sustainable finance in the overall portfolio. - Designing and implementing internal governance frameworks to oversee the development and implementation of the transition plan. Climate-related Risks BRD Group has identified different material climate-related risks that encompass both physical risks and transition risks, reflecting the multifaceted challenges posed by climate change. For climate change adaptation, the risks are primarily climate-related physical risks, as detailed in the previous Chapter General Disclosures, Section Double Materiality Assessment Process. For climate change mitigation, the risks are primarily climate-related transition risks. These arise from the challenges of aligning with stricter environmental commitments, market evolution towards sustainability and regulatory developments, as detailed in the previous Chapter General Disclosures, Section Double Materiality Assessment Process.

This additional filter has been removed for FY24 reporting (and restated for FY23) as it is not applicable for exposures with unknown use of proceeds. • FY 2024 eligibility of BRD Group’s mortgage loan portfolio was reassessed to include the entire portfolio, compared to the FY 2023 report, where only a portion of the portfolio was included, namely the portion that met the Significant Contribution technical criterion; • For the purposes of FY 2024 reporting, BRD Group adopted a more conservative approach and assessed its mortgage loan portfolio as not aligned, as described above in the section “Data limitations”.

In the context of permanent transformations in a dynamic environment, BRD Group’s employees are crucial for achieving the strategic objectives, sustainable development and ensuring the quality of products and services offered to customers. An efficient business model transformation needs to be accompanied by a strong foundation represented by an optimal organizational set-up, a good working environment, a powerful corporate culture and strong employee commitment. In this regard, BRD Group takes responsibility for creating a proper work environment by providing its employees development opportunities. To identify and assess actual and potential impacts on our workforce, BRD Group has established processes aligned with ESRS 2 IRO-1.

Unmanaged stress could lead to higher turnover rates, impacting health, safety and overall productivity. The annual employee Barometer deployed all over SG Group entities revealed rather high level of stress of employees and a decrease of the employees’ satisfaction on work life balance, including in BRD Group. This was considered a focus of attention to be looked into in order to improve the indicators, prevent the stress, burnout and a socio- psychological risks, and increase the emotional safety and wellbeing at work.

This could result in reduced productivity, stifled innovation and negative financial performance. This risk is particularly acute in the context of the digitalization of banking services, where evolving technologies demand new skill sets.
